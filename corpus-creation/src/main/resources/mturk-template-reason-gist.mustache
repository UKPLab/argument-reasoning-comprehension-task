                <small>
                    Dear Worker, thank you for your interest in our HITs! You are taking part in a large-scale research project conducted by the UKP Lab at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany.
                </small>
            </p>

            <h3>Task</h3>

            <p>You see {{numberOfArguments}} arguments to different topics. There is always a
                <strong>standpoint</strong> to the
                topic and a single <strong>reason</strong>.</p>

            <p>Your <strong>task</strong> is to
                <strong>rephrase and simplify the reason so that it captures the gist of the reason</strong> used in the argument.
            </p>

            <h4>Recommendations</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Do not add</strong> any new evidence, your own point of view, or information that is not included in the reason.
                </li>
                <li>Replace pronouns (anaphora) with nouns or phrases they refer to, if it's clear from the context.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <small>Example:
                            <em>Standpoint: Veganism is not good for everyone. Reason:
                                <strong>They</strong> have always looked unhealthy to me ->
                                <strong>Vegans</strong> have always looked unhealthy to me.</em>
                        </small>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Do not simply copy & paste!</strong> Such HITs will be rejected right away.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!--<p>Try to find the most straightforward and plausible explanation possible. Adults wouldn't probably buy it anyway, but maybe kids with less experience and world knowledge?</p>-->
            <!--<p>Which means: you can make up things, but keep them as believable and relevant as possible.</p>-->

            <div id="examples" class="example">

                <p>
                    In argument about college sport programs:
                    <em>"The amounts RU has paid coaches and athletic directors is, frankly, obscene. That monstrosity of a stadium, built at a cost of $100 million, is obscene."</em>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OK</strong>
                        <em>"RU coaches are overpaid and the cost to build the stadium is $100 million."</em>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wrong (too oversimplified)</strong>
                        <em>"Sports programs cost an obscene amount of money to operate."</em></li>
                </ul>


                <p>
                    In argument about longer school days:
                    <em>"Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally."</em>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OK</strong>
                        <em>"To ensure the best performance in school, students should receive 8 hours of sleep."</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wrong (adding reasoning of the argument, not simplifying the gist of the given reason)</strong>
                        <em>"The school day should not be longer, it is important for students to be well rested to start their day of knowledge."</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In argument about longer school days:
                    <em>"I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep."</em>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OK</strong>
                        <em>"Many people, including me, underperform without an adequate amount of sleep."</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wrong (adding information not present in the original reason)</strong>
                        <em>"A longer school day would cut into the time students have available for sleep, and the lack of sleep would cause them to underperform."</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In argument about vacations with or without kids:
                    <em>"I would have been happier if my parents had left me at home for many of our vacations."</em>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OK</strong>
                        <em>"I would have preferred to stay at home rather than go on a family vacation with my parents."</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wrong (generalizing to "many children" which is not stated in the original reason)</strong>
                        <em>"Parents should consider vacationing without children, many children would be happier if they had a choice."</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In argument about taxing capital gains:
                    <em>"From a strict economic viewpoint, all income should be taxed equally. This would avoid the huge incentives - and wasted, non-productive investments - in gaming the system, that firms and investors routinely make."</em>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OK</strong>
                        <em>"Equality in taxed income would eliminate risky investment by firms and investors."</em>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wrong (missing the gist of the reason)</strong>
                        <em>"Capital gains represents a form of income and should be taxed."</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
