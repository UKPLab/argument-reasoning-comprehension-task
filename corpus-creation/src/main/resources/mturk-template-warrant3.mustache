                    Dear Worker, thank you for your interest in our HITs! You are taking part in a large-scale research project conducted by the UKP Lab at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany.
                </small>
            </p>

            <h3>Task</h3>

            <p>You see {{numberOfArguments}} arguments to different topics written by a fictive person, John Doe.
            John comes from a far away (probably not the U.S.), so he has a different common sense knowledge and a rather weird way of reasoning.
            Yet, John likes discussing about current controversial issues.</p>

            <p>In each argument, John <strong>takes a stance</strong> to the issue and <strong>provides a reason</strong> to support his argument.</p>
            <p>But he does not explain his line of reasoning, so we don't know why and how this reason is relevant.</p>

            <p>Your <strong>task</strong> is to <strong>fill the gap</strong> and explain John's reasoning.</p>
            <p><strong>You might feel</strong> that the provided reason is <strong>actually supporting the opposite side</strong> than the one John takes,
                but as we said - John's world plays his own rules... So can you <strong>fabricate</strong> a meaningful explanation?</p>

            <h4>Recommendations</h4>
            <p>Try to find the most straightforward and plausible explanation possible. Adults wouldn't probably buy it anyway, but maybe kids with less experience and world knowledge?</p>
            <p>Which means: you can make up things, but keep them as believable and relevant as possible.</p>


            <h4>Some examples</h4>

                <p>Argument about experienced teachers:</p>
                <p><em>Teachers become better and more consistent with more experience. And since [...explanation...], I claim that Teachers do not need to have experience</em></p>
                <p>Possible explanation: <em>not all students need a good teacher</em></p>
                <p>Improper explanation: <em>everyone has to start somewhere</em></p>

                <hr/>

                <p>Possible explanation:
                <em>
                many patients taking marijuana as an alternative medication are also hardcore drug users
                </em>

                <hr/>

                <p>Argument about whether bank fees are necessary:</p>
                <p><em>Banks have free use of our money for weeks, months, and years. And since [...explanation...], I claim that Fees are necessary.</em></p>
                <p>Possible explanation:
                    <em>money we put in banks is not sufficient for them to make ends meet</em>
                </p>
                <p>Improper explanation:

                <hr/>


                <p>Argument about humanities programs in colleges:</p>
                <p><em>Students need to think critically and outside of conventional ideas. And since [...explanation...], I claim that Colleges do not need humanities programs</em>
                </p>

                <p>Possible explanation: <em>humanities programs do not teach critical thinking</em></p>

                <hr/>

                <p>Argument about veganism good for anyone.</p>
                <p><em>I couldn't think straight without dairy products. And since [...explanation...], I claim that Veganism is good for everyone</em></p>
                <p>Possible explanation: <em>people don't need to think clearly to function</em>
