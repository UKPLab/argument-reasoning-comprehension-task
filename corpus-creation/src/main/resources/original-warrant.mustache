                    Dear Worker, thank you for your interest in our HITs! You are taking part in a large-scale research project conducted by the UKP Lab at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany.
                </small>
            </p>

            <h3>Task</h3>

            <p>
                There are {{numberOfArguments}} arguments to various topics written by a fictional person, John Doe.
            </p>
            <p>John comes from a far away (probably not the U.S.), so he has a different common sense knowledge and a rather peculiar way of reasoning.</p>
            <p>His arguments are broken because his <strong>explanations</strong> of the given reason seem to indicate the opposite than he eventually <strong>claims</strong>.</p>
            <p>Your <strong>task</strong> is to correct the explanation in order to fix the logical reasoning of the argument.</p>

            <h3>How to correct the explanation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do only <strong>minimal changes</strong>, try to keep the original line of reasoning. It might only involve negation, indefinite pronouns, or similar.</li>
                <li>Make sure your fixed explanation makes sense by reading the <strong>sanity check</strong> box.</li>
                <li>Stay <strong>objective</strong> even if you strongly disagree with his views.</li>
                <li>If you feel your edits would completely change the the line of reasoning, mark it as <strong>impossible</strong> and provide an explanation.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Ignore typos or small grammar errors.</p>

                The only acceptable exemption should be a legitimate medical reason, such as a vaccine allergy. And since <span class="underlined-text">vaccines contain chemicals many children may be allergic to</span>, I claim that Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

                Companies laundered drug cartel money and made 8 billion and were only fined 4 billion for this. And since <span class="underlined-text">the company admitted when they were guilty</span>, I claim that Companies can't be trusted
