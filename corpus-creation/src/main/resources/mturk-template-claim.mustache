            <p>
                <small>
                    Dear Worker, thank you for your interest in our HITs! You are taking part in a large-scale research project conducted by the UKP Lab at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany.
                </small>
            </p>

            <h3>Task</h3>

            <p>
                There are {{numberOfArguments}} arguments in total in this HIT that are
                <strong>completely independent</strong> of each other, written by different unknown persons. Each deals with a different topic. For each argument there are
                <strong>two tasks</strong> to be done.
            </p>

            <h4>First, choose author's overall standpoint towards the question</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Read the
                    <strong>argument</strong> fist, make sure you understand it. Choose from the two opposing options offered. If neither of them apply of the argument does not even talk about the topic, choose the last option (<em>"Neither of them or the argument does not even take a stance to the topic."</em>).
                </li>
                <!--<li>If the debate topic is unclear on the first sight, have a look at the possible standpoints. Both standpoint options might not represent both sides of the issue.</li>-->
                <li>If the argument favors both stances but one more strongly, select the the more strongly favored stance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Second, find and mark author's standpoint in text, if it is explicitly written</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>If the author takes stance on the topic, can you find whether the standpoint is mentioned in the argument text explicitly? If so, mark sentence or sentences that directly say so by
                    <strong>clicking on them</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>By
                    <strong>explicit standpoint</strong> we mean that the sentence (or sentences) must be understandable on its own and it must clearly say what is the author's position. It is usually done <strong>by rephrasing the debate question</strong> (for example: "Yes, cloning should be definitely abandoned").
                </li>
                <li>Using pronouns is also allowed (for example: "He was the best singer ever!" for the debate title "Was Frank Sinatra the best singer?")</li>
                <li><strong>Reasons</strong> explaining
                    <strong>why</strong> the standpoint is taken,
                    <strong>must NOT!!!</strong> be marked.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example:
                            <strong>Debate: Harry Potter VS Lord of the Rings</strong>
                            <em>"I enjoyed the lord of the rings movies. They were amazing!</em> &#8592; This is giving a reason thus should NOT be marked
                            <em>[...] Lord of the rings is better.</em> &#8592; This is the standpoint and must be marked
                            <em>[...]</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Example: "He could sing anything!" is not the main standpoint for the debate title "Was Frank Sinatra the best singer?" as you need reasoning to get the point.
                        </li>
                        <li>Example:
                            <strong>Debate: Is the younger generation today more fortunate than their predecessors?</strong>
                            <em>Young people are less fortunate than their predecessors</em> (&#8592; This is the standpoint and must be marked)
                            <em> because they have to face more stress now as compared to before. </em> (&#8592; This is giving a reason thus should NOT be marked)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The standpoint must appear in the argument text, not in the debate topic</li>
                <li>If the author's stance is not explicit and direct (but you can infer it with your common sense), check the option
                    <em>"I couldn't find author's standpoint explicitly and directly written in the argument, it contains only reasons for it."</em>
                    <strong>This happens quite often</strong> as arguers might only give some reasons and let your human reasoning to infer the stance.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>General hints</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ignore spelling and grammatical errors, these are social media texts.</li>
            </ul>
