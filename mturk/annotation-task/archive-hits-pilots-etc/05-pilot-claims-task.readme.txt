ARG392N6HWZCJ, thanks
A1KM3RO255T3T6, You need to have more specific answers in the author's standpoint than no or yes
AMGCMMQSM0ZGX, Make sure the questions are yes or no format. The last question was in "or" format, thus one cannot agree or oppose.
APHEGFR0EZXIJ, The second one wasn't a yes/no question, so only selecting 'yes' or 'no' wasn't appropriate.
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ, Some questions, such as hatred or heritage, cannot be answered yes or no.
APHEGFR0EZXIJ, Several of these weren't yes/no questions, so choosing 'yes/no' as answers was tough or impossible.

A1IQV3QUWRA8G1, Deciding the author's standpoint value needs to be a little more explicit, in my opinion

A3UDJWW0KB25HU, This is a very good HIT, as it focuses on real topics that are going on in the world today
A2TJIDOW77PZ4F, Such short arguments give little space/time for the author to take the stance. In all of these I felt I knew the author's stance, but they did not explicitly say it yet.
Also, the instructions sort of make it sound like there are opposing articles for each debate.

A2VDGWD0BBMSP2, The instructions are very long and not entirely clear. Hard to work out whether you have answered the questions correctly or not.

A16IHP7GC3NDON, there are a few grammatical errors in the instructions.

A2EWT6ORLP2XY5, I think the instructions were given well, but none of the arguments I reviewed seemed to have an explicit standpoint segment. I don't know if that is normal or if I'm just dumb and missed them.

AKC90OYLRWKVW, The Dodd-Frank question was very difficult because we have to choose between yes and no. The individual standpoint was yes, banks are still a problem, but by answering yes,
I would also be answering yes to "Has the Dodd-Frank regulatory system done enough?" which the author clearly argues no.

A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ, Is cursive dead asks one q, but the question But should students be taught it anyway? asks another Q.

A2PR62W2I7YGNT, I can't seem to submit this hit unless I click on the button titled "I coulnd't find authors standpoint explicitly and directly written in the argument, it contains only reasons for it."

A1SVJRX4L97NMC, I think the passage for question #2 (Segregation by Ability) was sarcasm, and I didn't know what to do with that.

A19DOARRVT6ZNN, I couldn't find the option to select if the author's standpoint wasn't explicitly written.


A2PR62W2I7YGNT, I think it sounds too personal

A36U5NVXMV5GGA, These are good arguments. However, it would be better to add a little more information, would make it alot easier to find the authors standpoint.

A2ODZAVURDFOHM, Most of the statements don't have much to do with the questions it seems.

A39CQ0EIJ3KRX8, Some clearer instructions would be helpful.

A2EWT6ORLP2XY5, As far as I can tell, most of the arguments in the HIT don't even take a stance on the topic.

A1J18S5XXHGEM7, The final HIT seems to have glitched on this particular HIT and did not allow me to click any of the text, forcing me to check the "I could find..." box. Maybe check the coding?
