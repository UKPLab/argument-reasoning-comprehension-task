AKC90OYLRWKVW, Perhaps allow people to select smaller sections of text instead of a long sentence
where the argument is stated but is simultaneously clouded by distracting supporting details within the same sentence.


A3RSYBAGLACUSB, In the last two I was not able to select the sentences that lead me to the answer.
It was also hard to figure out how to delete a sentence once it was selected.
A22IEBDFJ8ND9, Well done
A20WVG1T4X405G, I really enjoyed this HIT.
AKC90OYLRWKVW, You could leave a text section optional following each segment for people to explain
their reasoning behind choosing certain responses. For some arguments, it is hard to locate an exact
sentence yet we are able to assume because the tone of voice and details imply the stance.
