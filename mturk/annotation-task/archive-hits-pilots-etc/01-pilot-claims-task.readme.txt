AJE0K0QN4T6F0, If the standpoint is stated as part of the debate topic, as it is in the last one here, I can't click on it.
-- Make sure the standpoint must appear in the argument text (not in the topic)

A2XT0TJIZLJHGB, Some of the author's standpoint choices don't represent both sides of the argument.
A28SSXMVARPGIK, There is a problem with the choices for the debate question that asks whether women should sit at home or work ? It does not have the option to select in favor of women being able to work. This is the position taken by the essay in this batch. I had to select no argument stance taken which is not exactly correct.
A28SSXMVARPGIK, at least one of these topics didn't contain a clear question so it was necessary to look at the two options in order to determine what the topic actually was.
A3OLJHL9DYZ4QK, The debate topics themselves are sometimes hard to comprehend

-- "If the topic is unclear on the first sight, have a look at the possible standpoints."
-- "both standpoint options might not represent both sides of the issue"


A33QIDY0I5ACET, Not sure why the topics have spelling and/or grammatical errors. Assuming replies are layperson responses and this is some AI training exercise
A1601UNFFAAQOI, Many spelling and grammatical mistakes
A28SSXMVARPGIK, On the final essay you really need to provide an option for none of the above that is atheists arguing that there is no such thing as hell. All you have is dying forever in hell or living forever in heaven. A lot of these answers take a stance, but it's not one of those .

REPHRASE -- "Neither of them or the argument does not even take a stance to the topic "

-- "Ignore spelling and grammatical errors, these are social media texts."
