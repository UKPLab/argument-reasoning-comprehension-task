A224B7BAQ0MZSN, If an argument includes "Yes!", is that the entire explicit standpoint, or is the
following reason ("Yes!  It causes bad things.") included in the explicit standpoint that I should click on?

+++ Only yes, no explanation why or reasoning!


A224B7BAQ0MZSN, I would appreciate a few examples of how clearly in favor of one standpoint an argument
has to be, or if a user should just use their best judgment based on implications in most cases.

A224B7BAQ0MZSN, I am unsure of how much an author has to imply his opinion lies one way or another
for me to select their standpoint.  I used my best judgment on the first question since it seemed
like he favored Apple in his response, but I am not entirely sure he implied it was better heavily
enough.  A few examples in the instructions might be good.

+++ add some examples?

A224B7BAQ0MZSN, The first question seemed to agree with both standpoints, but favor one because the
other was a weaker reason.  There is no option for "both", but it still seemed to take a stance, so
I selected the slightly favored option.  I would appreciate something in the instructions noting what
to do if the author favors both, but one more strongly - should I choose "no stance," or the more
strongly favored stance?

+++ Add to guidelines: if the person favors both stances but tends to one, select the the more strongly favored stance

A224B7BAQ0MZSN, I would suggest specifying if there is a limit to how many segments with the explicit
standpoint can be selected, i.e. up to # of segments, or if all explicit segments can be selected.

+++ Add limit.. there's no limit, but usually there's either one explicit stance or none at all (very rarely twice)

A224B7BAQ0MZSN, I think this HIT is very well-functioning and understandable.  The instructions
could have the option to minimize/expand them to reduce screen clutter.

+++ HIDE instructions?

A224B7BAQ0MZSN, The last question does not seem like the two presented standpoint options are
completely related to the debate topic, unless they are borrowing heavily from implications instead
of what the topic directly stated, so I was not sure about that one.

Should Hillary Drop Out?

S0There's a reason each state has its own primary - the only reason a candidate should 'drop out' before a convention is if there's absolutely no way they could get the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination.

S1Clearly, large numbers of Democrats qould prefer Hillary over Obama. claim: S2There's no reason to disenfranchise them because he's presently ahead. S3If he had garnered the number of delegates required, then of course, but he hasn't.
