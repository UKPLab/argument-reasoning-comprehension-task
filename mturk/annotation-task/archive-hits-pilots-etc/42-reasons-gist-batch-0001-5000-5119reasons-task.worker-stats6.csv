Being naive doesn't really make a reason why Colorado went to far with pot.  I did try!;#3 & #5 were hard, I truely did my best and am almost out of time, lol.  They didn't seem to have a clear reason though similar topic and wasn't sure what would be right to do there...;The 3rd one, It goes on and on but doesn't give a reason that has to do with above info whatsoever..;The last one just doesn't jive with why librarians are expendable.  Also, thanks for the reply to my comments :)  I had already left a good review but updated the communication rating to a 5 and left more feedback :) Thanks again!;Last one, although long, really doesn't state anything spectacular as far as a ""reason""...:)"	3S4AW7T80CUOXGP4KMUYGN39LXD4LP	374UMBUHN51CPDDVW8X5XSTURH2TCG	6	6	615	1041	258	335
