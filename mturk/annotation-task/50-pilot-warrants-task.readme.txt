A1YX741QQSMKPS, Some of John's reasoning is actually an argument the whole question's validity. [3OJSZ2ATDT87EE42UXCY2ARMNIG75G; 3MDKGGG61QZN9W4UMHK2BS1KV37T6K]
A385VR6EE1HI6F, Some more direction might be helpful. [3JW0YLFXRUSGHCKNY67JKQ3G07MWWJ; 3MDKGGG61QZN9W4UMHK2BS1KV37T6K]

A31EZYDK16XB9U, Your title seems to have a typo, it says "Can you make sense out of a weird reasoning is arguments", shouldn't it be "in arguments"? [3P1L2B7AD21S19ZM3697UL9EZ2VLON; 3MDKGGG61QZN9W4UMHK2BS1KV37T6K]


A1B96Q3ZEU7W8A, this is unique type of hit please make more. [3FIJLY1B6VGOMH1RWVJOO89KCCZFPP; 3P888QFVX3606MI659C1NNCOWW2QOS]
A1YX741QQSMKPS, no [3J4Q2Z4UTZFBXFO1MX8DS1LUC58WQG; 3OLZC0DJ8JRIF83KTDT69DFA1FIIVJ]
A1HKYY6XI2OHO1, Just want to repeat, please make the timer longer on these.  I actually had plenty of time, but I hate feeling like I'm racing against the clock. 20 minutes would be nice. I left feedback on a previous HIT, and ya'll responded asking me to leave a positive TO review, which I've done. ;)  I'm not sure I understand these HITs; for example, this one, the initial argument is, people underperform when they don't get sleep, so let's have a longer day?!  I went with it, and tried to come up with something plausible, but I'm not certain I actually understand the task, if that's not correct. ;) [340UGXU9DZDQAJVDDWNMG0Z58HCVUA; 3X4Q1O9UBHYQ04DR9A3VNWVTR6AO7S]

make longer time [ok]

A13NOSGEQMNGP8, This was interesting. [3ZAZR5XV02UBX9JNS2RP70QVPVSZCR; 3X4Q1O9UBHYQ04DR9A3VNWVTR6AO7S]
A1YX741QQSMKPS, Yes, boxes big enough to be able to review answer [3018Q3ZVOJ2E230YY71LF2Y8G8BARO; 3IQ9O0AYW6B32GZVOITR8VRP4U2IT3]

make boxes bigger [ok]

A3UQ9R1VDVVQKR, Thanks [3I2PTA7R3U6K2FUKXJPA4QRZP3XKQG; 3IQ9O0AYW6B32GZVOITR8VRP4U2IT3]
A1YX741QQSMKPS, I seem to know a lot of people like John [3ND9UOO81LE06I8OUS0HBFM02ZMWLS; 3HEM8MA6H9OIRMU7K9PGCNHE61YQP9]
A1YX741QQSMKPS, seems straight forward enough. [3FTOP5WARG0132J3Y0VJO504X51J0A; 3ZQX1VYFTDHU0IIAJFV11WRO2QGO8F]
A1VE1CAMPSYRHE, not sure, let me try another one [32SCWG5HIIGS3O8GV2GKU2W7J7TP6H; 3ZQX1VYFTDHU0IIAJFV11WRO2QGO8F]


My suggested changes:
- "John thinks that" before the textfield
- try both at the same HIT?
- disable "Impossible" button to prevent spammers
