Dear worker, thanks for submitting your HITs. I found out that some HITs took you less than 30 seconds to answer, which is a strong signal of not reading the text properly and randomly providing answers. Please, take it as a warning.

Dear worker, the answers you provided looked just random and the submission time (only 69 seconds) is a strong signal of not reading the text properly. I'm sorry but we have to reject your work to keep up our quality.

Dear worker, thanks for submitting your HITs. Some HITs took you less then 15 seconds to answer, which is a strong signal of not reading the text at all and randomly providing answers. Please, take it as a strong warning - next time the whole batch of your HITs will be rejected if this behavior repeats.
