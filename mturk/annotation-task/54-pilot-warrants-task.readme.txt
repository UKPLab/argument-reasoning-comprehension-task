== If Police Encounters Were Filmed; Should police officers be required to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public? ==
Police officers should be required to wear cameras [because] There are cameras in public places so privacy should not be problem.
----
A1OYYWJ2B7OQTD: Since cameras are everyone, police cameras would not be a problem and could be helpful.
-- missing the point with privacy; too much reasoning...
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ: Police officers as public agents  should have no expectation of privacy.
-- missing the point
A1I4CYG5YDFTYM: There are already a high number of cameras in public areas that record everyones activities so these should not be necessary.
-- wrong way :)

== Should the Government Grade Colleges?; Should the government rate colleges to hold them accountable for graduation rates, student debt and access for the poor and minorities? ==

----
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ: Standardized grading is logical.
-- OK: standardized scale is working well (is logical)

APW9F8OTJ4KXO : It's unnecessary to rank colleges since they'd all use the same scale.
-- repeating
A1I4CYG5YDFTYM: It would not be a good system because they would all be scored on the same standardized scale.
-- repeating...

== When Companies Close Doors to the Future; Should businesses be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals, agreeing to not to work for competitors? ==
Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals [because] Businesses shouldn't be able to stop employees from getting better deal when the businesses themselves try to get what's best for their business.
----
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ: It restricts employee freedom.
APW9F8OTJ4KXO : Businesses should not be able to impede an employee's future for their own gains.
A1I4CYG5YDFTYM: Businesses are only looking out for their best interest, therefore they should also allow employees the same privledge.

== When Companies Close Doors to the Future; Should businesses be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals, agreeing to not to work for competitors? ==

a way to sell what was once free [because] Everyone should pay the same for the same thing.
----
A34MRQ1OP87XC6: A restaurant who has on sale prices is not that popular
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ: It is ethical that restaurants should offer equal treatment.
APW9F8OTJ4KXO : It's unfair for people to pay to get into popular restaurants, everyone should have an equal chance.

== Keeping Only the Best Behaved; Are charter schools, with their high rates of suspension and expulsion, cherry-picking students? ==
Charter schools are not cherry-picking students [because] Where I live, I see them cherry-picking all the time.
----
A1OSRB1Q63XXWZ: They try to get the students that fit their idea of the concept of their charter.  If they pick anyone then it would not be a good fit and the school will fail.
A34MRQ1OP87XC6: It clearly states  I see them cherry-picking all the time.

Bad: (too much added content): They try to get the students that fit their idea of the concept of their charter.  If they pick anyone then it would not be a good fit and the school will fail.

Bad (does not relate to the given reason): Reports of police brutality have been all too common.
Bad (repeating the reason): Police already act more aggressively when they are dressed more aggressively.

TODO .... this is very hard one, I don't get the logic of the reason at all....

== Is Overcrowding a Legitimate Threat?; Do we still need to worry about Paul Ehrlich's predictions of an overcrowded planet? ==
Overcrowding is not a legitimate threat [because] There are limited resources available, and we must make sure that population doesn't outproduce the resources we have.
----
A11HK2XJZAXPPX: The reason is all about how there is limited resources
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ: It is evident that we have limited resources.
A1I4CYG5YDFTYM: There are only so many natural resources and things people need to survive. We must make sure that the population stays at a point where we have enough supplies for everyone.

Bad: (repeating): The reason is all about how there is limited resources
Bad: (rephrasing reason): There are only so many natural resources and things people need to survive. We must make sure that the population stays at a point where we have enough supplies for everyone.

----
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ: Comments counterbalance reporting.
APW9F8OTJ4KXO : Comment sections allow readers to call out biased reporting.
--wrong repeating
A1I4CYG5YDFTYM: When reporters fail to report fairly, the commentors can often shed light on not only that but the opposite side of the story.
--wrong: rephrasing

Good: Comments counterbalance reporting.

Marijuana is a gateway drug [because] I would have done hard drugs and died over 20 years ago.
----
A11HK2XJZAXPPX: The reason argues that a person would have died using something harder
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ: One person's testimony does not justify a common argument. ---nice but for the wrong side
A1I4CYG5YDFTYM: If this were true, given my history of using it, I would have died a few decades ago.

Good: I'm still alive


== Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?; Does using marijuana lead to the use of more dangerous drugs, making it too dangerous to legalize? ==

Good: Postponing the Olympics would not undo the damage already done.
Bad: There is too much damage from the Olympics.



== Are Medical Websites Healthful?; Does the internet add to patients' knowledge, or dangerously misinform them? ==
Medical websites are dangerous [because] It would be difficult to trust any doctor who discouraged patients from doing any of their own research.
----
A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ: It makes sense for people to research topics.  Not accepting medical websites would waste a potential good source of information.
A1I4CYG5YDFTYM: If doctors discouraged patients seeking their own information to become better educated, they are not a doctor to be trusted.
APW9F8OTJ4KXO : Patients should do their own research.




Criteria:
=========

2) Do not repeat what's already said

Foreign language classes should be mandatory in college [because] It takes a lifetime to truly learn a foreign language.

A11K5HVS2IU9RR: The person is stating that foreign language shouldn't be mandatory because to really learn one
it'd be a lifetime of teaching

which is only rephrased
"Foreign language classes shouldn't be mandatory in college because It takes a lifetime to truly learn a foreign language."


== Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?; Does using marijuana lead to the use of more dangerous drugs, making it too dangerous to legalize? ==
Marijuana is a gateway drug [because] I would have done hard drugs and died over 20 years ago.
----
A11HK2XJZAXPPX: The reason argues that a person would have died using something harder

It's only rephrasing known facts (I would have died) but missing the point,
which is: "I used to smoke marijuana and I'm still alive"


A11K5HVS2IU9RR: The person is stating that forcing someone to do something will not help their addiction



1) Minimality

Foreign language classes should not be mandatory in college [because] It takes a lifetime to truly learn a foreign language.

AOO53KIMNLQNM : "You are only in college a few years and cannot expect to truly learn the foreign language."
Can be simplified to "You are only in college a few years." (the rest is clear)

2) Don't add necessary distracting information

Companies should be allowed to patent genes [because] The human blueprint is part of the natural world and was not created by mankind.
----
A1OSRB1Q63XXWZ: Man should not play God.  If they patent genes it is like they are saying that they created it.
Can be made more clearer: "Only things created by mankind should be patented by companies."
Or "Natural world entities should not be patented by companies".


3) Avoid starting with "because" or "the person says" or similar, avoid pronouns if possible

== Should Drug Addicts Be Forced Into Treatment?; Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker wants to give hospitals the power to commit substance abusers. Is this the right approach? ==
Drug addicts should be forced into treatment [because] Forcing a person to do something is never effective.
----
AOO53KIMNLQNM : Because by forcing them the treatment will not be effective.
Better: By forcing addicts the treatment will not be effective.
