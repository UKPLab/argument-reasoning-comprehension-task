Let	O
me	O
begin	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
I	O
grew	O
up	O
in	O
farm	O
country	O
(	O
cash	O
grain	O
-	O
corn/soybeans	O
)	O
and	O
I	O
own	O
farm	O
land	O
and	O
annually	O
receive	O
farm	O
subsidy	O
payments	O
.	O
I	O
would	O
make	O
a	O
few	O
points	O
.	O
First	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
expound	O
about	O
farmers	O
and	O
farming	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
talking	O
about	O
.	O
Second	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
about	O
giant	O
farms	O
who	O
receive	O
huge	O
subsidies	O
all	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
presume	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
true	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
simply	O
doesn't	O
exist	O
in	O
the	O
corn/soybean	O
area	O
I	O
am	O
familiar	O
with	O
.	O
Third	O
,	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
dramatic	O
boom/bust	O
cycles	O
in	O
crop	O
prices	O
the	O
past	O
few	O
years	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
has	O
been	O
driven	O
by	O
speculators	O
in	O
the	O
commodities	O
markets	O
,	O
and	O
currency	O
manipulation	O
(	O
China	O
)	O
.	O
Fourth	O
,	O
farm	O
products	O
such	O
as	O
corn	O
and	O
soybeans	O
are	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
few	O
items	O
that	O
this	O
country	O
still	O
exports	O
in	O
large	O
amounts	O
,	O
so	O
you	O
had	O
better	O
be	O
careful	O
what	O
you	O
do	O
.	O
Finally	O
,	O
having	O
said	O
that	Premise-B
,	Premise-I
there	Premise-I
has	Premise-I
not	Premise-I
been	Premise-I
a	Premise-I
recession	Premise-I
in	Premise-I
farm	Premise-I
country	Premise-I
-	Premise-I
the	Premise-I
farmers	Premise-I
are	Premise-I
doing	Premise-I
quite	Premise-I
nicely	Premise-I
,	Premise-I
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
reason	O
that	O
crop	O
payments	O
for	O
corn	O
and	O
soybeans	O
should	O
continue	O
