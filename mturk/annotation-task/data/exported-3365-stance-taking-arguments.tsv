Ed	4	0	I'm curious when Democrats pull the lever for Dem candidates is this the type of thing they have in mind as they vote? It appears to me the Dems are willing to stoop to any manner of lawlessness to accommodate people who have flaunted are immigration laws. I can't imagine many people beyond those that stand to benefit from this being supportive.	12121613	Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Citizen of the State of New York	Is state citizenship the answer to immigration reform?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/24/is-state-citizenship-the-answer-to-immigration-reform	State citizenship is not the answer to immigration reform	State citizenship is the answer to immigration reform	false	false	State citizenship is not the answer to immigration reform
Ordinary Person	15	0	This is the worst article this newspaper has ever run on this issue. The author sets up a ridiculous series of strawmen that do not exist. He fails to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. He implies that someone should have the right to break our laws just because they have given birth here. He talks about the rights he wants to hand such people but he never really talks about the kinds of responsibilities most Americans want from any potential immigrants -- fluent English, no access to any kind of tax payer provided assistance, full observance of all our laws including labor laws. As the sign leading to Brooklyn states, FUGETABOUTIT! No form of citizenship for people who break our laws. If this bothers them, they are more than welcome to do what we want and leave.	12118949	Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Citizen of the State of New York	Is state citizenship the answer to immigration reform?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/24/is-state-citizenship-the-answer-to-immigration-reform	State citizenship is not the answer to immigration reform	State citizenship is the answer to immigration reform	false	false	State citizenship is not the answer to immigration reform

Richard	1	0	"This concept of allowing of states to grant citizenship is a really bad idea. While the idea of states granting citizenship has historical roots and may make North East and West Coast Blues States feel good the precedent has serious drawbacks. Does anyone for a minute believe that some of the more retrograde red states would not seize on the opportunity to make state citizenship far more restrictive in their bailiwicks. I can picture some of these states going back to the original definition ""White Male Property Owners over 21 years of age"" and probably add membership in a fundamentalist Protestant church as an enhancement.

After all, would not a lot of Texans, Alaskans, and others enjoy giving total fealty to their state and avoiding any responsibility to a larger polity? No? When enough people realize that immigration is driven by forces much stronger and more pervasive than domestic policy, that it cannot be eliminated by laws, fences, patrols, or any other local action, and that it will continue to be the boon for us that it has always been, perhaps then a rational discussion will ensue.	12118132	Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Citizen of the State of New York	Is state citizenship the answer to immigration reform?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/24/is-state-citizenship-the-answer-to-immigration-reform	State citizenship is not the answer to immigration reform	State citizenship is the answer to immigration reform	false	false	State citizenship is not the answer to immigration reform
Sequel	6	0	Determining entitlement to reparations would open major wounds in US society. The issue of the extent of racial mixing would have to be addressed -- a topic that the US (particularly the South, where it was rampant) finds extremely painful. Aside from permitting reparations for people who are obviously white, it would open a socially-divisive new polemic on determining who is white and who is black, based on genetics. As a society that is pretty much committed to allowing natural processes to make us, as individuals, as rainbow as we wish to be, reparations would be a terrible step backwards into social identifications based on race.	16312746	Thu Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Are Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Reparations Due?

Cristino Xirau	7	0	As a student of history I have learned that it is not wise to apply the understandings, mores and concerns of one's own time and place to past generations. George Washington owned slaves and no one in his day thought him any the worse for it. Indeed, I dare say he would be hard pressed to understand, let alone consider, the arguments of anyone in today's world favoring reparations for what was a legal and acceptable practice in his day and age. People of every time and place should be seen in the terms of their own time and place - not ours. If history teaches us anythiing it might for us to examine the failures of the past and at least attempt not to repeat them in our present.	16325513	Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Are Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Reparations Due?

john	21	0	"In 1860, the US Census reports that less than 2% of the census populations owned even one slave. Even in the Deep South, less than 4% of the population owned a slave. And, history shows that amongst the Southern slave owners were Blacks and African Americans. When one considers that most of the wealth generated by the industrial revolution occurred in the slave free North, it's hard to agree with the author's statement that ""...much of the wealth enjoyed by"" the US was gained through the slave trade. Overall, out of the 12-15 million Africans transported to the Americas, less than 4% ended up in British North America or the subsequent US. It would make as much sense for African Americans to seek reparations from the West African kingdoms that captured the slaves and sold them to European slavers."	16318175	Thu Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Are Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Reparations Due?

William Case	10	0	The chief argument against slave reparations in the United States is that the descendants of Africans transported as slave to the present-day United States are much better off than the descendants of Africans whose ancestors were not enslaved and transported to the United States. Today, the average per-capital income in Sub-Sahara Africa is about $750 a year and the average life expectancy is about 50 years.

Shreknangst	6	0	??? Reparations??? OK that means damage was done and the descendants of those who were brought to what is now the USA would need to prove they would be better off living under the Boko Haram. Keep in mind -- those who were slaves in the Americas were also slaves in Africa -- and were under the Islamic slave trade when sold to the Triangle Trade merchants. Thus slaves=slaves and they again need to show they, via their ancestors, are worse off by not having remained slaves in Africa. Then to there is apportionment ... would payments be made on the percentages of African DNA ? ??? or just based on skin color ??? Most people with African slave ancestors also have a larger percentage of DNA from Europe. Thus, only the slave percentage warrants consideration in the discussion -- the European portion is not due anything.	16319972	Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Are Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Reparations Due?

Julie	6	0	To those who feel wronged by the colonial slave trade: How much money per victim would be enough to satisfy the majority of those who feel affected? Would people of mixed race be given only a percentage of reparations equivalent to their African heritage? Would DNA tests be required for everybody? If the reparations wouldn't be race-based, what records would be used by people to prove that their ancestors were enslaved? Would descendants of white Quakers or poor white people (who were on record in the censuses as being non-slave owners) be required to pay too? Would descendants of white people from the North who fought in the Civil War against slavery have to pay as much as descendants of people from the Confederate states? What about financial accountability from descendants of Africans who are on record in the census as being slave-holders, or descendants of the tribespeople that helped facilitate the slave trade in Africa?	16319184	Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Are Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Reparations Due?

Mr. Phil	3	0	As degrading and horrible as the act of human trafficking was during the transatlantic slave trade, nothing can be done to heal that wound. At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation?	16318425	Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Are Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Reparations Due?

Curious George	17	0	A note regarding reparations for slavery: The West African slave trade was driven largely by internecine tribal warfare, in the course of which captured soldiers and civilians would often be sold as human chattel. European countries, followed by their western colonies, profited from this trade for several hundred years....a blot on their history, no doubt. But when they discontinued their part in the trade, and actively (in the case of Britain) sought to suppress it, there was an angry reaction from the indigenous rulers of West Africa, because slavery was the mainstay of their economies. The trade continued unabated (if perhaps less lucratively), as slaves were sold to the North African and Arab states, right up to the 1960s. The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial. So if there is to be compensation, perhaps it should come first from Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and other West African countries....that is, from the descendants of those who sold so many of their so-called brothers and sisters into bondage, for as long as the rest of the world allowed it.	16317447	Thu Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Are Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Reparations Due?

SoCal Observer	22	0	Blacks sold blacks into European/American slavery. The African tradition of slavery still persists in many parts of Africa. Mauritania leads with an estimated 10-20% of the population in slavery. Move on liberals ..... focus on today's slavery and the cultural issues that face Africa. How about focusing on today's sex slavery in the US in most major cities. Modern efforts to atone such as the Pigford Settlement are a total embarrassment and an under-reported scandal costing taxpayers $4-5 Billion. BTW - My family never owned slaves but a dozen of my family members fought in the civil War with two being killed, one in Savannah after the march to the sea and one on the second day of Gettysburg. Nobody paid my family any reparations. Move on!	16314901	Thu Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Are Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Reparations Due?

MR	1	0	At first the need for one person's opinion seemed unnecessary to me when we get so many for no cost but having critics is still very important in our lives; in the lives of the artist. To just the viewer it might not be so important for a professional critique but for the people behind the show it means a lot. Even if the critique isn't the most positive thing the artist still needs someone with experience to call them out on the things they might have not seen for themselves.

Charles Michener	2	0	"I've been a national critic of film, music, photography, books and cultural issues in general. I've always preferred the term ""writer about . . ."" to ""critic"" or ""reviewer"" (as in ""writer about movies or ""writer about dance""). A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of ""criticism"" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any ""critic"" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few. Unlike the casual opinionators who crowd the Internet, the best professional critics become longtime companions - passionate, prickly friends with whom one can agree, laugh and argue over many shared experiences."	7327906	Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Do We Need Professional Critics?

Yes equality is a problem and has been a problem throughout human existence. He avoided the issue. All kids need to do homework. It is a simple way to see if your child is learning, if they sit down in front of an assignment and have no idea what to do, you as a parent need to be aware of that and help them learn. It's part of the job description, at least in my book. And if I can teach my kid more than someone else, well that's life. Someone will always have more and someone will always have less. I still need to do the best I can.	13322086	Thu Nov 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Whose Work Is Homework?	Should parents help their children with homework?

Amy M	1	0	I must say I beg to differ. I think parents should help with homework and I think homework is helpful. My daughter usually only has 1 page of math homework per night which I make sure she completes. I have her sit beside me to work on it and I help her as needed. The homework is tied to what they have done that day in math and I feel it reinforces the concept. I agree that children need time to play and relax but if they don't do any homework/extra academics outside of school hours, how are they going to be able to compete and excel at the college level? Kids can't suddenly be prepared for college when they are in 12th grade -- they need to start becoming academically disciplined in the elementary grades. I feel that my daughter does much better in school and has a much more positive attitude towards her studies than if I were not involved.	13343210	Mon Nov 17 00:00:00 CET 2014	Whose Work Is Homework?

Those evenings in which my parents edited at my side turned out to improve my writing so much more than my teachers ever could. That one-on-one, painstakingly specific instruction taught me that active voice is preferable to passive and that there is a difference between formal, academic essays and casual, creative writing. Just because my parents helped me craft an essay didn't mean I didn't learn to become a better writer from that experience, and it certainly didn't make me dependent on them throughout my life. My younger sister, on the other hand, resisted their help, preferring to do her work alone. She became an exceptional writer and went to a great school. In the end, each kid has different needs.

R. Henderson	2	0	Yes, it is important for children to learn how to do their homework by themselves. However, reviewing assignments with them can often help them to see where they made mistakes or help them to clarify matters that they may not fully understand. If a child is able to feel comfortable discussing material with his or her parent, there is an opportunity to reinforce what the child is learning. These interactions can build self-confidence and help to develop critical thinking. Students who are in large classes rarely get the type of individual attention in a class that they may receive from an involved parent at home. Sometimes revisiting the material at home can present a child with the opportunity to understand more about it.	13319707	Thu Nov 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Whose Work Is Homework?

AC	5	0	Since many teachers don't actually teach, are left by the administration to run a classroom any way they want to, since it is extremely rare for any public school to have a code of conduct for teachers, for instance that they grade homework in a timely manner and provide prompt feedback, parents must too often fill in and do the individualized teaching that their kids need, and are not getting at the school.	13319591	Thu Nov 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Whose Work Is Homework?

A Goldstein	2	0	I believe there are no hard rules regarding parental involvement with homework. What is being overlooked in this discussion is the insight parents can get into so many aspects of their child's development including: 1) Academic progress in different subjects 2) Developing interests in potential careers 3) Relationships with teachers and even school peers 4) Early warnings of problems in school or more personal issues. Hints about all these issues can be discerned by the parent who takes time to help their children with homework which can even be just a guise for LISTENING. Homework involvement was a great opportunity to learn how our kids were doing.	13316560	Thu Nov 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Whose Work Is Homework?	Should parents help their children with homework?

Matt F	12	0	Humans don't resemble vegetarian mammals (cows, sheep) any more than we resemble bears. We are primates, and our closest genetic relatives (chimps) are omnivores. What's more revelant is that our digestive systems are still we equipped for eating raw animal protein such as sushi, clams and oysters on the half-shell, and steak tartare. Don't try eating raw potatoes, beets, or beans though, they're all indigestible to us. Although cutting back on animal-based foods is certainly healthful, a purely vegan diet offers many challenges to be complete.	6026123	Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

Kate	7	0	This argument is seriously flawed. What are this guy's qualifications? He's a chef, not an evolutionary biologist. Every living thing has evolved with certain traits that have enabled it to thrive. No, we may not have the speed and strength to kill a deer with our bare hands. But we have other evolutionary advantages that have enabled us to eat animals. Humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to an omnivorous diet. If we weren't fit to eat animals we'd be extinct by now. Eating raw meat makes people sick because modern factory farming and slaughterhouse practices lead to contamination. It's also the modern industrial diet that has lead to our current health problems (diabetes, heart disease, etc.) If people ate the way they did a hundred years ago and earlier (including eating meat) we'd all be a lot healthier. It's not meat that's the problem.	6024130	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?	Maybe some of us simply weren't built to be vegans.

BK	5	0	"No offense, Brian Patton, but this is by far the worst argument I have ever read in the NYT. Since when did we start basing our knowledge of what animals have been ""designed"" to eat on comparisons with the grizzly bear? So because a fox can't take down a deer, it should secretly be an herbivore? And no, we don't look like grizzlies, but we do look a hell of a lot like chimps and other primates that will rip animals apart with their bare hands and ""digest the raw innards"" just fine. Please don't base your argument on ""the logic of the animal kingdom"" when you clearly have no concept of biology or evolution. You're a chef, so you presumably know a lot about food. Why not construct an argument around the food itself instead of a subject you don't seem to know anything about? Just a suggestion. Thanks. Hugs and kisses. P.S.

motherlodebeth	2	0	A LOT depends on where one lives. Someone in frozen areas like Alaska,(a head of lettuce is $8) Finland, Siberia could never survive being vegan. Desert people with camels could never be vegan. Someone in an area with no land to grow a vegetable garden or access to a grocery store could never be 100% vegan. Yes, many Americans could be more vegetarian. We are mostly vegan but do eat the eggs our hens lay, and make yogurt from family goats that we have for brush removal, and its simply because we are blessed to live in an area where we can grow a massive vegetable garden almost year round. And what we cannot grow/raise, we can get from farmers markets, Whole Foods etc. But not every American is so fortunate. Reliable reserach done over decades show that SDA (Seventh Day Adventists) are the healthiest Americans and they are vegetarians. They avoid meat. Some will eat cheese, eggs.

sweetclafoutis	1	0	I am an omnivore who eats a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, eggs and moderate amounts of meat. I love cheese and yogurt, milk in my oatmeal, a splash or two of half-and-half in my coffee. I don't bother with sunscreen unless I'm at the beach and get my sun from walking around the city and jogging in Central Park. However, at my last checkup, I discovered that I am deficient in vitamin D. My doctor recommended I add a supplement. It seems it's hard enough to get all the nutrients one needs for optimal health from an omnivore's diet. The few vegans I have known--granted, a small sampling--have always looked unhealthy to me, with sallow skin and dull hair. I knew a vegan who insisted on feeding her baby a vegan diet as well, and that poor child is underweight and I'm afraid to say not very bright. I will not condemn a vegan, however, for his or her dietary choices; I wish that those vegans who do take a self-righteous attitude toward non-vegans would not condemn us for ours.	6024976	Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

Dan Frazier	6	0	"I was disappointed to read the ""Room for Debate"" essays published April 17 addressing ""Is Veganism Good for Everyone."" Of the six essayists, only two appear to be vegans, and not one is a physician or nutritionist. There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan, and no discussion of animal rights or animal welfare. Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary. The American Dietetic Association says that a vegan diet can be a healthy choice for everyone, including babies and breast-feeding mothers. The truth is that humans are adaptable and can do well on a wide variety of diets. There is still much that we do not understand about human nutrition. But one thing I do understand is that I have been vegan for 20 years and I have never been healthier."	6023377	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

I really think limited dairy has made a huge change. I do eat some, but it really made me sick when I did everyday. A very smart, organized person that enjoys cooking can design a diet without meat that is so heathy. When I saw how animals are raised for food, never seeing the sunshine or grass, shot up with antibiotic and chained to a metal pole (veal), or, dairy calves taken from their mother at birth, I as a mammal, could never accept such cruel behavior again.	6020156	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

Geekay	1	0	Lentils, whole beans, millets are great sources of B vitamins, their bioavailability increases if they are soaked overnight. Millets can even be sprouted then pound into a flour, they are gluten free. Some millets contain high amounts of calcium as well. Quinoa is another rich source of nutrition all around. As far as brain food is concerned, dairy and dairy products make up for lack of meat protein. However for stric vegans who exclude fairly products or those with lactose intolerance, meat and meat products is a good option. Being flexible is a great thing, being too strict or restrictive doesn't help anyone. Moderation is key, mix of vegetarianism, non vegetarianism is awesome, if one is willing to be flexible.

Kent	12	0	Mike Tyson ate meat when he was the most feared boxer in the world. He only became a vegan long after his boxing days are over, so he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete. Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it. You can go up a hill by walking on your hands. Doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way to do it, or even that this is a possibility for most people.	6021233	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

There is so much cultural resistance to veganism - we are literally programmed to think we ""need"" to eat meat, put eggs in cakes, milk in our cereal, etc. But being vegan is ""mainstream"" now and increasingly popular. Not only is consuming animal products not necessary, but it has led to the untold suffering of trillions of animals. We all have the choice to not participate in that.

Legumes rip up my intestines and leave me gassy. Modern seed oils (mislabeled as vegetable oils) leave me nauseated and in pain with bouts of diarrhea. Nightshades leave my joints achy. Soy... Soy is just evil to my body. I get spaced out, ADHD like symptoms, severe bloating, mood swings. The only way I can keep my brain and body symptom free is by eating grassfed meats and fats, starchy tubers, colorful veggies, berries, and drinking only water and teas.

Samuel	20	0	Vegans are disproportionately female, white, liberal, highly educated, active, and wealthy. All six of these factors dramatically increase life expectancy. Moreover, vegans are especially careful about what they eat and pay much more attention to nutrition than ordinary Americans. They are far more likely to eat organic vegetables and far less likely to eat fries and hostess cupcakes. And then there's the fact that unhealthy lifestyles like smoking or veganism tend to lead to weight loss, which masks many of the health effects. If veganism had no health effects whatsoever, we would expect vegans to live much longer and be much, much healthier. The fact that vegans aren't healthier--and may even be significantly less healthy--means that veganism is probably a pretty unhealthy lifestyle.	6017246	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

Nowadays, almost any grocery store offers vegan choices. There are also separate vitamin supplements available if needed, but most foods can be found with omega-3s, calcium, and zinc already added to them. Juices, along with meat and egg replacements are all healthy, vitamin-rich, vegan options.

A diet based on plants does not provide a sufficient source of energy to the body. Without a source of protein or carbohydrate, the body tends to slow down and function slower. Facts are facts. All of them in the article stand firm. Babies need a variety of foods especially because it is critical in their development.

Henry Rhodes	6	0	About B-12. My understanding is that normally, before people started eating so many dead animals, B-12 would come from the bacteria from the dirt on the raw vegetables that people would eat. Also, before we became so scrupulous about washing the dirt off plants before eating them. Also, before we started cooking all the life out of everything, including the nice healthy bacteria on the plants. Maybe also before we started pasteurizing so many things. Maybe the right probiotics would help. I went vegan a couple of years ago. It reversed my heart disease - no maybe.	6025276	Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

Nina isn't saying that it's unhealthy to raise kids on a VEGETARIAN diet (i.e. one that includes eggs and dairy). Neither is she saying that adults should not be vegan due to health risks. She is saying that it's risky for BABIES AND CHILDREN to be fed a vegan diet. Why are so many people responding to this article with long-winded replies about how they became vegan as ADULTS and are enjoying the health benefits? And why are others citing healthy babies raised on VEGETARIAN food as a rebuttal to this article? What part of this do you not understand?!?!	6023354	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?	Maybe some of us simply weren't built to be vegans.

Patrick	21	0	My wife and I are long-time vegans raising a healthy vegan child. Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers.	6023192	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?	Maybe some of us simply weren't built to be vegans.

SB	4	0	I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.	6022867	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

Kim Beauchamp, ND	4	0	Go, Nina! After years as a vegan (and the dangerously low cholesterol levels that came with it), I couldn't agree more that humans are omnivores by design. No doubt many of us don't get enough veggies, but that's not justification for ignoring our ancestry and anatomy/physiology. As a Naturopathic Doctor with years of clinical and research experience, I have a sound understanding of human nutrition. The bottom line is that there exists no sound argument that humans are designed to be strict plant eaters. In fact, everything from our teeth to the other end of our digestive tract suggests that we are, and have always been, omnivores. If we were meant to be vegans, we would not need to supplement our diets with the various nutrients that a vegan diet is deficient in.	6022328	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

Angelyne	6	0	Dimissing this information simply because she does not have any initials after her name, is simply a excuse for intellectual laziness. It's clearly a defense mechanism for avoiding the facts. If she was espousing vegan ideals, you wouldn't even think about her credentials or lack thereof. Veganism is more akin to a religious movement, that a simple lifestyle choice. And just like any religion, people do not like having their beliefs questioned, even when their beliefs are clearly based on myth and legend. Everything she has stated here can be verified from scientific sources. It's not opinion but fact. But here is an opinion. Feeding children a vegan diet is child abuse. Pure and simple. Same as if parents feed their babies a diet of coke and chips	6019443	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?	Maybe some of us simply weren't built to be vegans.

Geekay	4	0	Dear Nina, with all due respect, one would wonder how the rest of the world survived tens of thousands of years, without the Western diet posited by you! It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world!	6019509	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

dracul	11	0	In totality, this is a false argument for a meat based diet. Being a physician and seeing literally hundreds of children in the US (in vegetarian spiritual groups), and thousands in India, it is clear that meat protein is the least needed source of nutrients regardless of the well known environmental argument against a meat based diet. My own children are a perfect example. My oldest son, having never eaten meat in his life is now a professor at one of the most respected universities in the world. He certainly could not have succeeded if he were deficient in all those nutrients me ruined in the article. It is a falacious statement to say that McDonalds will make a child healthier because of the meat protein.	6018858	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

bob tichell	3	0	Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other.

A jefri	1	0	A great article. Many vegans may find themselves poised against it, but, beyond proving the scientific information in the article to be wrong, it will be very difficult to come to another conclusion than the author arrives at. Vegetarianism and veganism are mainly moralistic choices of life style, and should be presented as such. But somewhere along the way vegans decided to also try to make the argument that it's the healthier life choice, which is progressively being proven to be wrong. It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not the healthiest alternative only makes the moral choice more courageous. Nonetheless, I agree with the author that such decisions should not be imposed on children.	6018659	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

Sonja Coryat	1	0	I admire vegans because they've chosen a challenging lifestyle requiring a lot of work, discipline and attention. I tried it briefly because I'm so repulsed by the idea of eating a dead animal. It's so primitive. But after a few weeks of veganism I craved dairy foods so much that I couldn't think straight. So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust.	6017945	Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Veganism Good For Everyone?

In particular ""I have the gold I make the rules"" is the relationship of master and servant. If you want your kids to quit school and be waitresses or bartenders to get you off their back keep repeating ""i own you until you pay your own bills"". If you want a lawyer, a Doctor an MBA or a Phd in the family you have to learn to respect their autonomy while still providing support. Respect for autonomy starts early and grows as the child grows. The years between 13 and 18 are critical. The child has to learn self control and you have to learn to let go and respect your childs autonomy.

markomd	6	0	"I thoroughly agree with Betsy Landers that ""Parents who are monitoring their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy; they are cyber-savvy and involved."" As the highly cyber-savvy father of two teenaged daughters who loathe any 'invasion into their privacy', I consider it my responsibility to help them keep themselves safe. I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father. Someone's got to be the adult in the parent-child dynamic, and my kids, as wonderful as they are, are not 'it'.

I told her that was not right but she kept doing it. My daughter still doesn't care much for her mother for that invasion, and she was a good kid anyway. I just always told my daughter we lived in a small town and I'd find out at least half of what she did and she wouldn't know which half. Seemed to work, sure there was was normal teenager stuff.

Oriole	1	0	'Normal' ? This royal marriage may well last (she's definitely got staying power), but how 'normal' the British royal family will truly become is anybody's guess. Prince William, for all his good qualities, didn't mix with a lot of 'normal', (i.e. unrich, unposh) people at Eton. He went to St. Andrews, noted for its posh student body, but didn't last a year in university residence there. He was living on a landowner's private estate (with Kate) within six months of starting at St. Andrews. It's taken him eight years to propose to a millionaire's daughter. How much exposure has he had to life in a less hierarchical society than the British armed forces ? Not a promising start, for anyone expected to move to a more Scandinavian-style monarchy.	2854900	Wed Nov 17 00:00:00 CET 2010	Can a Royal Couple Be a Modern Family?

margosacco	12	0	I agree. The royal family needs to be taxed and pay their own bills like everyone else. Their decadent luxurious lifestyles are ludicous and outdated especially when the UK is facing severe austerity measures. William and Kate should pay for their own wedding. They are not indigent. The royals could make a fortune selling exclusive wedding photos to the tabloids. Personally, I cannot understand why couples live together before they get married when the research shows that they are more likely to become divorced than those couples who don't. I am old fashioned and think that marriage is a sacrament. I think that William and Kate are setting a bad example like all the other celebrities and other heterosexual people that are living together without being married.	2854709	Wed Nov 17 00:00:00 CET 2010	Can a Royal Couple Be a Modern Family?

The ability to use bio and bio-compatible materials and to make possible organ replacements as well as customized 'repair parts' is not well-understood as yet by either engineers or the public.

chispa7890	2	0	The key advantage for 3D printing will be mass customization -- not mass production. There will undoubtedly be vast improvements in the feedstock materials for the printers. And there will be applications in which traditional manufacturing processes will be better. But 3D printing will allow for customer choice on a scale not now possible. Take the example of a kitchen. We now build the shelving around the refrigerator, stove and dishwasher. Why not build a refrigerator to the dimensions and heights that work for me and the room? The printer can build the shelves that go around the unit as well. The refrigerator may have a motor and compressor that is manufactured by traditional methods but the rest can be uniquely fabricated by 3D printers exactly to the customer specs! Can we do this today. No. But most likely in less than decade.	12542176	Wed Aug 13 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Will 3-D Printing Change the World?

N.G. Krishnan	4	0	This write up is enlightening and sensible, dispeling some popular misconception about the breath taking 3D printing technological revolution. Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster. Rival will creating market changing, disruptive innovations.	12536410	Tue Aug 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Will 3-D Printing Change the World?

marvinhjeglin	3	0	If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.	16178496	Thu Sep 24 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is the Bar Too Low to Get Into Law School?

Of course, those are students who did well in college course exams. And good college test-takers did well on the SAT. So why not just go straight from the SAT to practicing law? Fact is, the reality of the bar exam is a powerful motivation to actually learn the material. There's merit in making freshly minted JDs do that. Just because we know certain students will do well on the exam, shouldn't excuse them from doing the work.	16176115	Thu Sep 24 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is the Bar Too Low to Get Into Law School?

Many students not adept at test taking make wonderful lawyers, not for research perhaps but as litigators. Law Exams in California go for three days and they are very tough but the best top schools have high percentages passing as they take Bar Review courses for a month or so before the actual three day grind. Only graduates from the top law schools with the best grades get the jobs with the giant law firms if that is what you crave you better have passed the bar the first time out.

Irving Schwartz	16	0	Our son , already a member of the Florida Bar, was studying to take Massachusetts bar exam using materials from one of the more respected prep schools. I accepted his challenge to take the closed book exam and he was amazed when he graded my answer sheet and found that I scored with a high passing grade. Sure, I have an engineering degree and have spent many years in business and government but zero time in law school. My logic may be flawed, but I came away believing that law school is mostly a scheme to collect incredible amounts of money from students, their families and their futures to pay faculty members. This position is supported by practicing attorneys who want to create barriers and limit competition. The guild systems produced society's skilled craftsmen for centuries. Instead of the sterile halls of academe prospective lawyers should repair to the law offices of practicing attorneys. Abraham Lincoln never went to law schools.

J C	9	0	The bar exam serves now as the only bulwark against the declining standards resulting from too many law schools being far too eager to lower their admissions standards in pursuit of higher revenue from student tuition. This is solely a problem created by the law schools. Any potential consumer of legal services should hope that the bar exam standards are not lowered to allow less educated or capable candidates pass. A potential client may never know that their attorney took three or more tries to pass the exam. As a practicing attorney for the last 20 years, I can attest that the quality of new lawyers has been in steady decline for the last 8-10 years. Some that I have to interact with are completely unable to adequately represent their clients. Others seem driven to take any case (if contingent fee based) or drag it out as long as possible (if hourly) by maintaining untenable strategic positions in an attempt to keep up with their billable hours and, thereby, continue servicing their outrageous student loan debts. The degree of professionalism and competency in the legal field has been in free fall and I solely blame the law schools.	16177946	Thu Sep 24 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is the Bar Too Low to Get Into Law School?

L.C.	1	0	I don't think it matters who is doing the work but rather, who is managing the workers and overall spending. We've seen that when things are done in-house (take the MTA, most city-run agencies) they can be an abyssmal failure). But we've also seen the same when it comes to HR and IT functions being outsourced to India, and customers are left haivng to deal with people with huge cultural differences ('yes sir...how are you sir....thank you for asking sir I am well...I can certainly help you with that sir...thank you for providing that informatino sir blah blah), and who have no ability to think but rather are solely reading lines from a manual. What matters most is the intentions of those at the very top. If management truly cares, then the job will be done well no matter what type of workers they hire. And if they don't find the right workers, then they'll keep firing the staff until they do, increasing salaries, or whatever else it takes.	3639910	Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Is Privatization a Bad Deal for Cities and States?

At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all.

Samantha	6	0	I'm sick of proponents glorifying the benefits of outsourcing because Americans have lost their jobs, thanks to lobbyists, political leanings and Wall Streets' focus on the bottom line. There is a correlation between our high unemployment rate and outsourcing. Off-shoring is the appropriate word but when you are one of the millions whose job is gone, off-shoring and outsourcing mean the same thing: no job. The biggest fear now is that when Tea Partiers and Republicans finish taking the government apart with the rataionale of getting spending under control, unemployment may be higher. Because outsourcing has the mantra of cheapest and lowest cost, our neighbors and children pay the cost. The wages paid in India, China, Brazil are not enough to support American lifestyles, communities and housing. Having seen the devastation that outsourcing has done to communities I've traveled to, I no longer support it. The devastating cost has long outweighed the benefits.	3639151	Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Is Privatization a Bad Deal for Cities and States?

Tom	21	0	Concur wholeheartedly with much of the article. The fact is, those with advanced degrees and good skill sets get much better pay and benefits in private industry and leave government on a regular basis (contrary to many of those who claim government employment compensation and benefits are better). In my own case, the private salary I was offered was 3 x the salary in government and had better benefits as well. The problems at the top are large but we never hear that from the smaller government proponents.	3638668	Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Is Privatization a Bad Deal for Cities and States?

Civil workers are generally paid less but they get full benefits packages. Overall the cost is far less than subcontracting to a much higher paid layer of executives who take that money and then wine and dine the government hacks who make the decision on contract renewals.

AZ_Hiker	67	0	We must all understand that when we privatize any industry that was once run by government it will, in the long-term, cost us more money, while taxpayers will have less oversight of those industries. Why? Because profit is added to the economic paradigm, (in lieu of non-profit management). Once a profit margin is figured into the economic model that was formerly a not-for-profit entity it will eventually cost us more. Plus, corporations have rights to privacy, so the public has little access to how their prisons, water treatment facilities, and the like are actually being run and managed.	3638542	Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Is Privatization a Bad Deal for Cities and States?

ShowMe	1	0	If the function is a basic governmental function, the job surely can be done most economically with direct government supervision of the employees doing the job. With privatization there is profit and the overhead of having goverment agents doing the contracting and overseeing the contract. When the Ohio governor wants to sell publicly-owned prisons to private contractors and says that then they become profitable, it says to me that the governor's thinking is not working well. Who pays the bill to the private contractor? -- the government! Plus some profit, and the overhead of competing the contract and overseeing that the contract is being properly carried out!! Also, contracting out jobs opens the door for politicians giving the contracts to favorites. Civil service regulations prohibits some corruption with direct government employees.	3640936	Tue Apr 05 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Is Privatization a Bad Deal for Cities and States?

Connie Boyd	57	0	Conservative members of the GOP are the foremost advocates of privatization. They also deplore government regulation. We saw the result during the Bush administration.

What people object to about huge college endowments is the sense they are more about hoarding and bragging rights than providing scholarships. Harvard is holding $30 billion. That money could provide an education to tens of thousands of students at many universities, but instead serves as a line item in the US News ranking of colleges suggesting that Harvard provides a superior education because they have this hoard. States should require these institutions to spend more of their endowments on services or, if they can't, share the money with other colleges or the state.	6028049	Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Do Wealthy Colleges Deserve Their Tax Breaks?

My school actively promoted me going on to graduate school. 100% of the women my senior class in chemistry went on to graduate school. This is the legacy of a women's college. The women who went to co-ed institutions told stories of harassment in the classroom and labs and found it difficult to obtain letters of recommendation let alone counseling and active support. Men in my graduate school were given forms for grants and scholarships while women were told they were a lost cause as the expectation was that they would soon marry and drop out. I don't think times have changed that much as I'm still one of a handful of women in my field and I'm not seeing a younger generation of women participating. BTW, I went to Mt.

It was an education class that was about 2/3 women. Guess who did 75% of the talking? Guess whose opinion was validated by the professor and the TAs? Not the majority.

Over the past five years, the Women's College has seen an 11% growth in enrollment and a 16% growth in retention. The university's retention rate of 85% is significantly higher than the national average of 68%. This boost has not been achieved by lowering admission standards.

What those majoring in STEM fields do career-wise after graduation is, naturally, another issue, particularly today, when students have so many more careers that their parents ever did."	14369581	Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?

jay65	4	0	Whatever the fate of the majority of women's colleges, the best such as Wellesley should survive. Why not have choice. I am unaware of any remaining, highly selective men's colleges, but choice should be preserved for women, especially if they can enroll in courses at nearby co-ed universities that are equally selective. Perhaps among the little Ivies, one or two should have remained all male. I went to a university that from the outset was to be co-ed (ok it took a few years while it raised money for a women's dorm). More than a few of my female contemporaries went on to excel in medical schools, law schools, and graduate school. I never noticed, however, any particular women's point of view in class; just excellence.	14368648	Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?

ediepa	12	0	As Native New Yorker said in those comments, there's room in the world for mixed and single-sex education. My experience has been that it's hard to know what a difference being in a same-sex classroom can make unless you've been there. I also know from my teaching experience that the males in a classroom need a different kind of learning space and shape than females often do, especially in the middle and high school years. They each get to the same place but often by different routes, and that's ok. It's not for everyone, but that's no reason to allow single-sex education to wither on the vine. It's relevant now, and will be in the future.	14367936	Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?

Carol	2	0	Single sex colleges are a remnant of an elite world where female students were trained to be good wives for rich male students, not to become independent working women (as so many end up being anyway). I attended an exclusive, very expensive women's college yet there were men everywhere anyway (as boyfriends). If women plan on competing in the real working world they might as well get used to competing with men as soon as possible.	14368424	Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?

michael Currier	30	0	Wanting to go to a single sex school is no different ultimately than wanting to go to a warm weather school or a school in the mountains or a snowy New England school. It is a landscape with a lot of valid choices. If you've ever visited Wellesley or Smith you will see an amazing learning environment in both locales. That schools struggle and go away is a natural thing: the landscape changes and the choices have increased dramatically. The idea that someone can state that single sex education is in any way bad is silly. It is not for everybody but please don't come up with theories to suggest it is not a choice for some: remember we've cultivated a pluralistic society where our wants and needs understandable differ.	14367986	Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?

Native New Yorker	15	0	There are powerful reasons for same sex schools to exist with relevancy just as there is a place for the dominate mixed sex schools. Each type of school bring a unique environment for a student, that can be advantageous to a certain student. Granted that there is so few single sex schools, strong schools with managed financials and endowments can succeed. I am surprised that Sweet Briar did not go coed to save itself or were unwilling to try - there may have been other factors (financial) that did not allow it to do so.	14365749	Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?

PhillyExPat	4	0	This is a very timely discussion for me. My own daughter is in high school (an all-girls Catholic high school) and I would very much like her to consider women's colleges as an option. I think they do foster women's leadership. I started looking around for academically rigorous Catholic women's colleges; the menu of options was very limited, so I expanded the search to include other women's schools as well. I can't help but think the tide will turn for these schools as professional women of my generation (I went to a girls HS, co-ed college and law school) look at colleges for their own daughters and see the potential in these schools for encouraging female leadership.	14367663	Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?

Wendy S. Aronson, M.D.	34	0	"I graduated from a ""Seven Sisters"" school in 1964 and just attended my 50th reunion. Medical school afterward seemed an anti-intellectual experience and was demeaning towards the few women there. My professional years that followed were far from equal, and although about half of U.S. medical graduates these days are female, income gaps persist. We have a way to go before celebrating full equality. Women make about 20% less than men, and are still mostly the ones directly responsible for child and elder care. We elected a black male president before a female one, and one sitting senator recently advised a female colleague ""not to lose too much weight."" since he liked his women curvy. Ambitious women are still perceived as ""pushy,"" and continue having trouble with that glass ceiling. We talk too much at corporate meetings and also too little. Aggressive AND passive ... and isn't that a psychiatric diagnosis? No corner office for her!

LaChavalina	11	0	And yet not a single writer in this series notes a fundamental irony: Despite the declining number of young men and women who express interest in attending a single-sex college, thousands of these same women and men every year enter co-educational institutions, then immediately set about segregating themselves: from men- and women-only dorms to sports teams to fraternities and sororities. Let's not fool ourselves. The experience of higher education in this country is profoundly gendered, no matter how much some of these contributors would like us to believe otherwise.	14367861	Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?

AR Clayboy	5	0	For the record, I was a 1970s-vintage member of a fraternity at a university in the northeast that has been required to become co-ed. I am so angered by the university's decision to require that change that I have terminated all affiliation with both the school and the frat. When last I checked, fraternities were a form of voluntary association. No one was required to join one. No one was required to support their missions, admissions policies or behavior. No one was required to attend their parties. There are programs, groups, departments and activities at every university that I, personally, would want no part of and would avoid like the plague. Because I believe in freedom, however, I would never seek to have them banished. Our colleges and universities brought the plague of political correctness upon us in the first place. The war on frats, because of what it represents, is a new and very dangerous acceleration in the trend to take away our freedoms and replace them with approved group norms. What ever happened to the notion that college was supposed to open your mind to new things and teach you to make and live with choices?	16102869	Wed Sep 16 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Should Fraternities and Sororities Be Coed?

Carl Z.	1	0	Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.	16102298	Wed Sep 16 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Should Fraternities and Sororities Be Coed?

In fact, we can think of many new things that are worse at the deepest levels on out souls: chain stores, etc. And late 19th Century architecture, for example of the Belle Epoque, is unspeakably superior to architecture put out by the reprehensible ""starchitects"" of today. And one need only look to the universally hopeless and laughable car designs of the 21st Century to realize that cars of the 1960s and 1950s, designed by our ""uncool"" fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers, were far superior and ""cooler"" than those designed by people today who think they are so cool. There is a movement in this civilization towards degradation of the soul, propagated by the 21st Century American corporation, which has been described as having emptiness and degradation at its heart. If publishing loses to Amazon, this will be another manifestation of the reality of the current march towards a world of aesthetic, and therefore spiritual, degradation.

Rich Carrell	4	0	Take it from a relatively new author, the present system sucks. First of all, it seems that most of the new books are by celebrity authors, many of which are just using their name to sell books and never wrote a word. Secondly, too many authors with great books are out in the cold since they cannot land a big time author. The system does not work very well for the readers. Go into a book store and look at the crap on display. Where do they find these books? With bookstore shelf space at a premium, I welcome anything that allows the little guy a chance. Besides, with e publishing, why do you need book stores? I like the feel of a book in my hands but at 25.00 it is too much. When the published gets 60% or more it makes no sense for anyone.

I am reminded of the prophetic commercial for Xerox ""on demand"" copiers; of course the commercial had everything to do with THIS and little with the product. A droning teacher is telling a large college class, presumably in English or Creative Writing, that they have to create a good, salable product that a publisher would WANT to publish (and edit) for a profit. Then a smarty pants student stands up, tells everyone about the Xerox system (whereby one could theoretically print just a single book) and tells the class ""Now, EVERYONE can be a published author!"" The elated class, thrilled to hear they don't have to learn to write well, market themselves, edit anything or make a profit for the publisher...STAND and applaud. That in short sums up everything here. EVERYONE can be now be published, since the costs are virtually zero to Amazon or any publisher.

Absolutely ridiculous. Referring to their editors as Chimpanzees is beyond low and trying to say that you're not is more than back-handed. And why must one automatically assume that they'll dominate the publishing industry -- especially if all they are interested in is widgets and algorithms? Inconsistent to say the least, especially if everyone else is so damn good. Seriously biased article and extremely flawed logic. If taking these kind of subtle but bratty gibes at Amazon makes someone feel better and gets them a few handshakes over their afternoon lunch in mid-town Manhattan, then I guess that's likely the real end result.

The Semi-Child	5	0	Interesting article. Is Amazon trying for a monopoly on publishing as well? For a writer (like myself) the opportunity of Amazon is the most appealing in regards to finacial benefits. Publishing companies demand, in my opinion, a ridiculous about of royalties. Amazon lets the author keep almost all of the royalties and also the money. The only downside would have to be advertisment and publicity. Publishing companies get the word out far. Amazon pretting much leaves you on your own. So, depending on how good your book is, the profit could fluctuate in each circumstance. If the book is good, I'd publish it through Amazon. If the book was semi-good, I'd go to a publisher. Simple. The Semi-Child	4753464	Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Will Amazon Kill Off Publishers?

Today I can publish my ebook myself and of course edit it after I write it and spell check it as well. Now I can earn 70% on every ebook sold. That allows me quite a bit of leeway in promoting my ebook. Tell me more why I should use an author agent who takes a commission and a publisher who makes a lot of money from my writing? By the way, they never gave authors extra money when they submitted the manuscript electronically saving publishers money by not having to enter text into a computer from typewritten pages-they kept the savings.

Newspapers have been lean and efficient, they juat aren't capable of satisfying the demand curve of today's public. Telecommunications and transportation behaved similarly to publishing and they underwent dramatic restructuring. The music production industry is well on its way toward completing a shake up. It isn't pretty, but it is too late for publishing to control their future.

chip	4	0	This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall. The system is patently unfair to condo owners, and this article is simply dishonest!	14105269	Wed Feb 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Does Helping Condo Developers Hurt the City?

Brad	12	0	Does the $57 million figure include the retail in the Time Warner Center which includes several dozen high-end stores and a handful of world-class restaurants? I suspect it does, and if so, then Mr. Spinola is being intentionally deceptive which as a corporate shill is essentially his job. One additional quibble: the ultra-luxury developers are NOT primarily building housing. They are building investment opportunities for the super rich-- many of whom will do no more than stop by their apartments from time to time. The very LEAST the city can do is tax these properties equitably so the city can get some reasonable benefit from the fact that so much available land is being developed for non-use and thus crowds out housing opportunities for people who actually want to LIVE in NYC.	14105461	Wed Feb 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Does Helping Condo Developers Hurt the City?

Navigator	2	0	I am surprised by the naivete of many commenters and even some contributors. The business of NY is real estate and the banks that finance it. Much like the business of Washington is government and the business of Las Vegas is gambling. Real Estate taxes and the revenues that come from the construction of new buildings is the lifeblood of the city. It has been that way for at least two hundred years. Ours is not a national capital like London, Paris, or Berlin. We are a business city and have to generate as well as spend money. NY has been very good at both things for many decades. The idea that somehow real estate interests are out of control or taking over how the city is run is perhaps news for 1815, not 2015. Without the millionaires and billionaires building and buying these fancy new places, New York would be Philadelphia. Philadelphia is a lovely place and if you prefer it, you should seriously consider moving there because NY is never going to be Philadelphia.	14108506	Wed Feb 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Does Helping Condo Developers Hurt the City?

Something is horribly wrong with this politically motivated mathematics. Everyone is outraged by the 421-a program at 157 West 57th Street and one could argue that its not fair that the ""rich people' are getting this tax break: the opponents and critics never mention that on a $50 million apartment sale over $1.4 MILLION in transfer and mansion taxes are paid. If a building like this was not constructed, where exactly would the city generate these tax dollars from? What about this $ 1.4million in taxes collected from the sale alone doesn't benefit the public? What is government doing with the MASSIVE taxes they are collecting from these sales?

Capt Tom Bunn LCSW	1	0	This outrage at VW is misplaced for two reasons. First, because focus on VW takes the heat off polluters that matter. All the VWs diesels on the road combined put out less pollution than a single power plant. Second if something is worth regulating, it is worth effective enforcement. Enforcement via the honor system is no enforcement at all. When corporations are allowed to control the testing, it is downright silly to get outraged when discovering the results are rigged.	16629308	Wed Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

John	8	0	Regulation standards, and standards for policing them are two different things. The failure was not that we did not have clear air standards, it was that we relied to much on the companies to enforce them. It is not enough to tell aliens that can not simply cross our borders, or tell people not to take weapons on the planes. We need credible tests and policing on the government side. We check on the TSA and thus detect failures when dummy weapons are planted. We need to do the same diligence for other regulations like emission standards. It is not enough to rely on the honor system when it is not in an entities best interest to comply. John	16625502	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

D. H.	2	0	WHITHER VW So VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software manipulation. Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know.

Cathy	5	0	Marketplace regulation, or regulation by natural fallout of consequences in the marketplace, actually requires a company to victimize the public, before being caught out doing it. Certainly we can decide that some things the public can choose for themselves - unhealthy food, cars that chew up more gas for instance. But do we let the company take our money for a product that is not as advertised? Do we allow truck drivers to drive until they fall asleep at the wheel? Do we allow car manufacturers to produce cars that kill customers, and not require that they investigate and report on it? Do we allow companies to dump toxic metals in people's water supply? Do we allow companies to ship us salmonella and e coli as a matter of course? Or sell drugs that are untested? We regulate to protect people before they become victims, and to give people recourse once they are victimized. It is only common sense.	16621092	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

Jan	4	0	How silly. Adams ignores the reality that corporations are not actually real people; they are entities with a sole and simple goal: to make a profit. Real people at or near the top who attempt to bring honesty, fair play, or anything else other than profit will be passed up by real people with only one goal: to get to the top, by whatever means will bring the best profit for the next quarter. Without regulation from outside the entity, it's really a matter of time before disaster strikes. At which point real people get hurt, but often not including those who caused it nor the corporation itself.	16630140	Wed Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

Larry Crittenden	2	0	The idea that Mr. Adams supports--self-regulation by companies--is deeply flawed. While waiting for the markets to punish companies for bad behavior, many people are harmed. The harm can be both financial and physical. The lag time between the misdeed, the discovery, and the correction can be years. Many of the regulations we have in place are reactions to the failure of individuals and companies to behave in ethical and legal ways. Businesses fumbled away their opportunities for self regulation a long time ago. That said, businesses still have a right to participate in the writing of regulations, as do their customers and other stakeholders. Regulations are, by nature, burdensome. Often the weight of the burden is prompted by the serious nature of the original offense.	16628932	Wed Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

Gelbstoff G.	15	0	The conclusion presented by Mr. Adams are not supported by the evidence. The recent economic meltdown, and the history of the tobacco, oil, and car companies (to name a few) show that large corporations are intrinsically unethical. Their objective is to make money, and other considerations are secondary. They are driven to regulate themselves only by the fear of economic sanctions brought by strong regulations - as Mr. Adams seems to admit. I would ask Mr. Adams to consider, for example, if industries would have self regulated to reduce acid rain producing emissions in the absence of a strong regulatory regime. Would coal mine operators self regulate to improve safety standards? I could go on with dozens of well documented examples. I invite Mr. Adams to visit several industrialized countries with weak regulations and see the effects of the philosophy that he proposes on the environment and living standards. Fundamentally, the only connection between Mr. Adams governance prescriptions and the real world is that, when implemented, they hurt real people.

KenC	8	0	Mr. Adams, in the absence of regulations, there would be no financial fallout. As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout. They would build diesel cars that maximized their profit and that imposed tremendous costs on everyone else. There would be no incentive whatsoever for them to do anything else.	16626427	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

John	1	0	It is the role of government to create laws and regulations, and also to enforce them. I understand the VW situation was an example of incompetent policing or enforcement. The problem was not the standards did not allow unsafe air, it was incompetent or ineffective enforcement. I have heard that same is true with Guns laws, in Chicago, mainly that they are strict but not well enforced. We similarly have laws against illegal immigration that are not, in my opinion, faithfully executed. Part of the rule of law is not simply having laws and regulations, but effectively enforcing them. Shame on VW for violating emission requirements, and shame of those who develop that testing standards for not catching this. Why don't they do more extensive emission tests separate from individual car inspections so this type of thing does not get missed.	16624642	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

What we need is tougher regulation (working to avoid regulatory capture by those who are to be regulated) and tough jail penalties for corporate officers.	16624526	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

Pundit	1	0	Yes, there is such a thingas as regulatory capture - companies find ways to manipulate rule-making bodies for their advantage to to keep out competitors. Without the existence of such rule-making bodies, they can't be captured - so companies find other ways to keep out competition. those ways are not perfect, of course, but then, comapnies are not always perfectly successful at regulatory capture.

How many people would have purchased other makes had they known the real pollution emitted by the diesel industry? Would you have baseball played without umpires? Football without referees? Do you want a game decided by a homer that was actually a foul ball, or a touchdown scored because a defender was illegally tripped?	16621134	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

Lennerd	48	0	Right. HSBC gets into the business of laundering money for Mexican drug cartels. They know they are in that business from the start. Over the course of a few years they make 8 billion dollars *profit* laundering money for Mexican drug cartels. They admit guilt. They are fined 4 billion dollars. Exactly what incentive do they have to stop? They *made* 4 billion in profits doing the crime and paying the fine. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to sell-regulate. They'd make twice as much money!	16621084	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

Mark	4	0	If there will always be ways to cheat than perhaps the regulations and laws should be about outcomes, not about methods. Suppose instead of a regulation describing a testing station the law said that if a car exceeded the pollution standards the manufacturer would have to refund the full original retail price of all units of that model car (including sales tax) and pay a fine for all the miles driven. Then all the mechanisms in the world for cheating wouldn't matter; just getting caught once would be the end of the corporation. Inventions guarantee that methods will change but the outcome is the outcome.	16620981	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

Betsy S	5	0	The problem with this philosophy is that a lot of innocent people get hurt when self-regulation fails. People who own VWs may see declines in the value of their cars. Workers at VW may lose their jobs. The car dealers who sell VWs will experience declining sales. Stockholders may end up losing more than they ever gained from the fraud. Competitors who did not flout the rules have already suffered. There is also the possibility that VW as a corporation won't, in the end, have to pay for their behavior. Without the threat of punishment for failing to comply with regulations, what is the recourse for society? It's the air quality that affects everyone that was damaged.	16620855	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

Glassyeyed	14	0	All criminals think they are best equipped to regulate themselves. There simply is no way to anticipate all the potential ethical failures, all the ways to cheat or all the ways to conceal that cheating that criminals may come up with. So let's just throw the rule of law out the window and let criminals take over the streets, threaten citizens, extort honest business people, and generally bully the populace into submission. Oh, wait, you say only rich corporate CEOs should be given free reign? Criminals without a gazillion dollars in tax-free offshore bank accounts still need to be policed so that they don't ransack your mansions? Either we're a nation of laws or we aren't.

sdavidc9	10	0	If self-regulation by businesses is to work, VW must find that its cheating is unproductive. It must be the horrible example that will impel other firms to avoid doing what VW did. VW workers must lose their jobs and VW stockholders must suffer. To the extent that these things do not happen, self-regulation fails. Other firms will see that the consequences of dishonesty are manageable if sometimes severe. Since this is what firms have generally seen, self-regulation will not work and those firms should want a powerful and fair referee like the ones found in professional sports.	16620553	Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Companies Be Trusted?

A.	1	0	Obama is absolutely right. But it's not just death in war - homicide is way down. People think that the murder rate is high because the news tells us about horrible murders. It is a fact that the homicide rate is lower than it has ever been: you were far more likely to die by murder in every other era. We have the data for Western Europe going back about 1000 years, and the murder rate is lower than its ever been. Even hunter gatherers, whom we like to glorify as living peaceful, natural lives, had higher murder rates than we do.	19712635	Wed Sep 07 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is the World Becoming Safer?

Mark Thomason	3	0	We are not seeing a trend toward less violence, except in the most limited sense. There is a trend toward fewer engagements between larger organized units in classic military combat. There is a trend toward more engagements of what was once called small war, the ambush or raid sort of thing. That is not small, just diffuse, as in the violence tearing apart Mexico. This limited definition of violence also would not see the widespread US drone strikes as violent. Targeted assassinations are violent, and a policy of doing many of them is war, even if only one side is exposed to all the dying.	19709020	Tue Sep 06 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is the World Becoming Safer?

EarthMom	1	0	I agree with some of the comments about not pushing kids too young to read and write. However, kids benefit from a preschool environment even if it is all play based. New Zealand has a free preschool program, but the kids don't start learning to read until they enter elementary school and NZ has one of the highest literacy rates in the world. It also benefits those who are in the lower middle class and don't qualify for free programs. This is where we really need to start making a push. So that their kids don't end up in the lower class.	8390305	Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

wnhoke	1	0	The problems with universal pre-school are the unstated objectives of the program. First, most people are sympathetic when children have parents who can't or won't care for them, but the objective of the program is to get women in the workforce - out of the home. This applies even when they can stay home or want to stay home. Secondly, the responsibility of child care and education belongs to the government, with parents assisting only. I would hate to see a society where all of our decisions belong to the government and parents and families have only a secondary role. A sad future that far too many people blindly accept and embrace.	8389640	Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

liz953	1	0	Since the creation of the Dept. of Education, billions of dollars have been spent to improve public education. Spending per student continues to increase while student performance has been flat, or by some measures, has decreased. With this record, can anyone justify universal pre-school? Brick and mortar schools are becoming dinosaurs. Charter schools, home-schooling and approaches are being chosen by many families who see public schools as inadequate, and public school teachers as captives of the politics of the teacher's unions. With this trend, can anyone justify expanding public educaiton to include 4 and 5 year olds?	8389228	Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

Arline Ostolaza	1	0	I am strongly inclined to assert that a thoughtfully structured program be made available to all pre-kindergarten children regardless of their family situations. I've noted that children born to upper-middle and high income parents suffer a diminished capacity to learn just as low-income children, owing to disinterested or ineffectual parenting. There will always be exceptions to the norm--the largely self-taught Abraham Lincoln, for instance. For the most part, however, it seems to make more sense to devote preventative measures whenever possible in order to improve the lives of our citizenry, thereby enriching the nation as well.	8392635	Wed Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

EB	10	0	I would like to suggest an additional choice. If we are going to subsidize preschool or child care, why not also subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to? We are constantly being urged to copy European measures to provide care for children outside the home, but we are never urged to follow the example of Finland, France, Norway, Belgium and Austria by also providing parental home-care allowances. Why the selectivity? I am afraid it is because while feminism claims to oppose our tendency to hold the work of childcare in low regard - a tendency which predates second-wave feminism - it has done virtually nothing to correct that prejudice. Instead it supports an everybody-into-the-workforce ideology which in turn relies on the availability of underpaid childcare.	8389047	Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

nancy peske	3	0	But what happens if the preschool standards include socialization skill development such as turn taking, perseverance, self-regulation through movement and meditation, and other techniques? Also, parents don't always make the best choice for their children. They can be strongly influenced by family and cultural norms, and be in denial of their children's developmental delays. Choice sounds wonderful--who wouldn't want more choice?--but when those choices are based in emotional reasoning and not logic and sound social science, choice can make parents feel good but rob children of what they need. Maybe we need better education of parents as part of the preschool model. Teachers and day care providers can be taught the skills for providing parental education and even breaking through denial to some degree.	8385921	Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

My son did go to preschool because we knew that kindergarten today is more like what first/second grade used to be. In many schools, if you aren't beginning to read by the time you start kindergarten, you will be behind. Comparing Head Start kids to kids who don't attend preschool may not yield a difference. Compare Montessori or private preschool kids to kids who don't attend preschool and you will absolutely see a difference.

MaDa	2	0	It seems to me that comparing universal pre-K to universal kindergarten is apples to oranges. What makes pre-K so important is the teaching of so-called soft skills not offered in kindergarten or beyond. No amount of additional kindergarten is going to offer the valuable intensive lessons in curiosity and exposure to new experiences. Advocates of pre-K aren't simply asking to extend traditional K-12 education by one year, they instead want to give all children the opportunity to learn the non academic skills needed for future success.	8391093	Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

MB	2	0	There is a similar system in the UK. All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st. As my son's birthday is in October, this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment (unless we decide to put him preschool of course). Why not lower the kindergarten age by a year instead of starting a preschool program? The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning, the better.	8390396	Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

Kathleen	16	0	If only the United States would look to this model in Sweden. I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption.	8386236	Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Public Preschool a Smart Investment?

I also see those who struggle to get coherent thoughts on a page. Guess what? Those who write well tend to be the more successful business leaders. The message the SATs should send is to tell students that the ability to construct a coherent and supported paragraph or short essay is critical to business success.

We need only consider the letters written home by the relatively uneducated soldiers of the Civil War, the power of which only a minuscule percentage of today's high school graduates (not to mention so very many in college) could hope to equal. Writing skills are acquired, first of all, through READING ( a lot!) the works of those who write well; and then, through WRITING (a lot!). Neither is possible to any significant degree of success in our public education system, because existing class size would require teachers to devote every single evening until midnight, and then the entire weekend, to reviewing and evaluating their students' writing assignments. An impossible proposition. What is required is a reduction of class size to no more than twenty. As any language educator worth her/his degree and job knows, that is the maximum class size for effective language skills development. Are you laughing already? Of course.

But it will be pretty obvious whether the kid can write competently or not. I do understand that some kids have been memorizing essays for the SAT's.

Marino	2	0	"Citizens should absolutely be able to record police activity if they're not obstructing officers from lawful action, and this right should be explicitly codified. The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty. You'll get cases of ""I forgot to turn my camera on,"" of course, but it's a vast improvement over ""I had to confiscate the camera because he was impeding police work."" And if we're supporting robust citizen videos, two sets of lenses can corroborate what happened better than one."	10344127	Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	If Police Encounters Were Filmed	Should police officers be required to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public?	/roomfordebate/2013/10/22/should-police-wear-cameras	Police officers should be required to wear cameras	Police officers should not be required to wear cameras	false	false	Police officers should be required to wear cameras

Secondly, we must protect against aggregation of data by the State. They will use it to prospect for suspects and potential offenders by employing analytics on masses of information; use would not be limited to single case or incidents.	10336993	Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	If Police Encounters Were Filmed	Should police officers be required to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public?	/roomfordebate/2013/10/22/should-police-wear-cameras	Police officers should be required to wear cameras	Police officers should not be required to wear cameras	false	false	Police officers should not be required to wear cameras

Harry	4	0	I strongly believe that cameras should be monitoring police officers 24/7. Every day police officers take advantage of their authority and act in ways which they would not act if they were on camera. On the other side, having a camera constantly monitoring officers would also protect them from citizens and the video footage would be able to be used as proof if needed in law suit cases. Cameras would benefit both the citizens from the police officers and the police officers from the citizens.	10346152	Thu Oct 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	If Police Encounters Were Filmed	Should police officers be required to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public?	/roomfordebate/2013/10/22/should-police-wear-cameras	Police officers should be required to wear cameras	Police officers should not be required to wear cameras	false	false	Police officers should be required to wear cameras
PS	1	0	No cameras: 1) Enough with the obsession on surveillance of citizens. The outcome is a super jacked government that terrorizes its citizens. 2) Do citizens get to film the police, too, so that they can have his/her own copy for his/her own protection? If the answer is no, then it is clear that this is not a move to protect anyone but the police. And they are already armed, have stun guns, have cuffs, radios, databases, partners. What's next, syringes? Drones? 3) More gadgets do not address the fundamental issues, which are distrust, miscommunications, misconduct (on both sides), and more. 4) Aren't most people respectful of police when they are unlucky enough to be involved in any questioning? Why punish all for the trouble that a few cause? In the end, why not move toward community policing instead?	10339747	Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	If Police Encounters Were Filmed	Should police officers be required to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public?	/roomfordebate/2013/10/22/should-police-wear-cameras	Police officers should be required to wear cameras	Police officers should not be required to wear cameras	false	false	Police officers should not be required to wear cameras

The problem of privacy is not with regard to the Policeman himself, since as an official with the right to kill you he should at all times be filmed while on duty. The problem is with the people he is filming, who may not want this. So there should be strict laws regarding what happens to the video data. However, its such a useful tool that it must be employed, or at least tried.	10338169	Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	If Police Encounters Were Filmed	Should police officers be required to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public?	/roomfordebate/2013/10/22/should-police-wear-cameras	Police officers should be required to wear cameras	Police officers should not be required to wear cameras	false	false	Police officers should be required to wear cameras

getserious	12	0	One of my best friends is a Chief of Police in a small suburb of a big city. Although he initially opposed police wearing cameras, after the policy was in effect for a while, he changed his mind. He says that his biggest problem with young offices is that they overstep their authority, and the cameras help reign in these overzealous officers. In addition, when detainees complain about the conduct of an officer, he can check the recording of the arrest. Most of these complaints are without merit. So, it sounds to me that there is a benefit to the police and society by using the cameras. As far as privacy considerations, the cameras are being used in a public space, so I do not see this as a problem. (I am a member of the ACLU.)	10340252	Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	If Police Encounters Were Filmed	Should police officers be required to wear cameras that record their interactions with the public?	/roomfordebate/2013/10/22/should-police-wear-cameras	Police officers should be required to wear cameras	Police officers should not be required to wear cameras	false	false	Police officers should be required to wear cameras

John Gunther	2	0	Separating internships as a special class of poorly paid work seems almost pointless. If MacDonald's can't employ a cashier who's willing to work for less than minimum wage (or for free), why can ABC do it for an intern? The only reason for an exception would be if the intern is there for true training purposes and not for the employer's immediate benefit. Clearly, most interns are there to supply grunt labor, whether or not they actually get a chance to show their stuff. Also, the kind of large corporations who hire rafts of interns can certainly afford to pay them minimum wage to escape all legal scrutiny. These firms could still take comfort in knowing that minimum wage isn't nearly enough to live on.	5449542	Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

Jodi Anderson	17	0	With the costs of education FAR outpacing inflation, I wonder what these unpaid interns have to do to keep their heads above water? (Those who aren't lucky/rich enough to have parental support, that is). Of course, the price inflation of education accident. It's due to the government policy of underfunding public education. Coming from a disadvantaged background, I was simply unable afford to take on unpaid work during and after college, regardless of how much it might have helped my future career to do so. Thus I was at a disadvantage compared to peers at my college. This doesn't really sound like a level playing field, does it??? One additional point: The emphasis on internship experience on resumes allows employers an easy way to ascertain which candidates are likely to come from wealthier backgrounds...making it easier for employees to discriminate in terms of social class and race (since certain races are more likely to be represented in the disadvantaged group). Not fair. And we wonder why there are no jobs out there? Employers are filling lots of them for free.	5445428	Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

GrammyofWandA	12	0	I went back to school in my mid-40s and earned a PhD. As a middle-aged, overweight female in a highly competetive field, I found most internships automatically closed to me. I finally had to accept one that paid less than $200 per month--and I had to move 1000 miles from home (renting an apt.) to take it. I learned a lot, and returned home to a good career in my field (after a 2nd lowly-paid year elsewhere--but at least that covered rent). I do understand that the internship site had financial problems. But I am very much aware that I was able to take that internship ONLY because I was a married woman with a husband who worked, and money in the bank. That should not be the norm.	5445067	Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

Rachel	1	0	As a student, I don't mind internships that are considered volunteer positions as much as internships that are paid in college credit. I'm willing to work for free if I can gain valuable experience. I'm not willing to actually pay tuition to work, especially since full-time college students can get sufficient credit hours in four years as long as they don't fail any classes, making any extra college credits basically useless. If I were to place any restrictions on unpaid internships, I would say it's valid to limit the number of hours employers can require a student to work unpaid. If it's the summer and you're only working at your internship part-time, you can get another job to pay your expenses. Of course it's not fair to those who have no support from their families, but internships that actually provide experience in the field serve a pretty big value to society, and I don't think playing fair is a good enough reason to get rid of them altogether.	5450307	Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

MicheleVarian	6	0	I don't like using unpaid interns, because i think that it is a form of elitism. I could never have afforded to work anywhere for free. Only students from families who can support them can afford to work for free, which excludes all of the students who are just scraping by to go to school and paying for it themselves. These students make the best employees. They take learning and work seriously. The problem is that graduates are now coming to the work force with far fewer skills and previous job experience than in previous generations. Many graduates have never held ANY job, be it baby sitting, dog walking or waitressing. I have found it preferable to hire graduates or students who are committed to working for more than a semester at a low wage with the understanding that due to their lack of experience, I will teach them, but they are more committed to stick around once they have learned and make great employees as their salaries go up with their abilities.	5445924	Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

While a college upperclassman I cold-called Senators for several sessions in an effort to land an un-assisted (mom & dad didn't make any calls trying to influence anyone) and unpaid internship. Perhaps it is a simple example of ""even a blind hog finds an acorn once in a while"", but the next session I was hired as the Senator's aide when the Sr. aide elected to return to graduate school. I held that paid position four years until I too left to pursue my next educational objective. The result for me was: a) a paid position upon receipt of my undergrad degree; b) acceptance to a graduate program otherwise out of reach for many and; c) my decision to mentor and host interns for the past 30 years. Take the internship; you might just snuffle-up an acorn too."	5447926	Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

Emanuel Kataev	3	0	I've been an intern at several places and can say that while there are educational elements to them, interns are mostly given grunt work to assist paid employees. After my experience, I have decided I will never be an intern and/or work for free again. A lot of people are fooled into believing that based on their grades and/or standing in school, there is no other way to get your foot in the door. That is not true. As a mediocre student, I was able to find a paid position where I worked, got paid, and just as well received the same educational value I would have received if I was unpaid. In my opinion, interns should receive minimum wage. Granted, they have no experience, minor if not any qualifications, and generally no practical knowledge. However, they use their limbs and their brains just as any paid employee. This would be most fair, and would certainly boost the United States economy.	5447530	Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

Abby	10	0	The fact is unpaid interns are not just students seeking experience. They are recent graduates who can't find a paid position, and unemployed workers trying to avoid gaps in their resumes. There is no doubt that employers are exploiting unpaid interns. I know several people who have interns at their jobs. These interns are replacing employees. It's just a way for an employer to save the $35,000 a year it would cost to pay a full-time employee. I routinely receive emails from people with multiple unpaid internships on their resumes. Most interns are not getting hired after their internship is completed. They are not learning new skills. Interns should be paid minimum wage.	5445948	Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

Responsible Bob	1	0	The pathway to a career in medicine is designed to benefit specific areas of medicine. To be considered for admission to medical school, candidates must spend significant time and effort on research. This results in substantial free labor for tens of thousands of researchers. Also this effort is focused on research rather than more specifically to areas such as serving the community, which has a lesser role. International medical school graduates also spend months and sometimes longer demonstrating their skills to obtain a residency position. This is another area that can be abused as the stakes are high and there are few protections against abuses. Health professional associations and corporations preparing candidates for standardized tests have a great design that benefits them well, but fails to deliver the health professionals needed.	5445604	Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

JMO	2	0	What needs to happen is that insitutions of higher learning need to develop standards for internships. This should include a limit to the number of unpaid hours a worker can work in a week without triggering automatic compensation. Also companies should agree to interns representing only 5% of their workforce. The dirty little secret is that some companies are relying extensively on internships as a labor source. One of those companies is Disney, which has a good portion of its theme park workforce filled by interns. Then there must be standards for the work, flipping burgers or waiting tables are not acceptable intern experiences for college graduates.	5445253	Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

Jackie	4	0	My company pays interns $10 an hour, and they often are required to do very menial work. That said, interns who show eagerness and promise may be offered full time positions with the company. For-profit companies should absolutely pay their interns. The small investment is an incredible bargain when you consider it a screening tool for potential employees. Several full-time members of my department started out as interns. I can say from experience that it's a far better screening tool than a job interview, and worth every penny. I think unpaid internships are fine, but in limited circumstances--for example, if the student is still in college and can get academic credit. In this case, though, you'd want to make sure that the student is getting training and is not forced to do menial tasks. I had some internships like this in college and they were very beneficial. I also think that non-profit organizations should be able to offer limited unpaid internships. In all other circumstances, internships should be paid, and interns should at least receive minimum wage. If for-profit organizations can hire unpaid interns, there's too much potential for abuse.	5448954	Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

Christopher Stienon	1	0	Another problem faced by students is that of getting college credit. A lot of unpaid internships make up for the lack of a salary by offering to cooperate with colleges to give credit for the hours worked. Except that to get credit, it's up to the student to pay tuition fee attached to it. In effect, we have a system where students are paying out of their pocket (or taking out a bigger loan) in order to work. Not to mention that many colleges limit the amount of credit that can go to fulfilling something useful like a major.	5448454	Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students?

But another employee mentioned that she has no experience and has no way to get a job. So what is the point of even educating oneself if employers require someone strait out of school to have to have relevant experience that they weren't qualified to obtain before they got their degree.

SPQR	1	0	Analogies are a weak form of argument, but the parallels in predicting medical outcomes and those used to predict criminality are inherently the same. In both instances the goal is predictive accuracy. Statistical functions, such as logistic regression and odds estimation models are not inherently good or bad. A researcher may think that if one can predict medical or sociological outcomes, then one understands them, but that is not the case. Statistical correlation may not demonstrate causality, but it directs our attention to possible causal factors--such as the link between smoking and cancer. Thus the use of probability models in criminality studies is heuristic and acceptable. First, demonstrate a statistical association, and then try to identify and construct a causal model.	16711658	Thu Nov 19 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Crime Be Ethically Predicted?

andystac	1	0	Earlier in the last century the theater set designer Edward Gordon Craig dreamed of the 'über-marionette' so that he could create a more unified stage picture. This concept has been rolling around in the back of the minds of many designers and directors since then but has never really been achievable until recently. However , for better or worse it has also become extremely easy to do, anyone who can work a mouse can pretty much do it now, no skill needed (don't let anyone tell you that this is not a fact). The effect houses are moving offshore and will soon be the the animation sweatshops in the third world. It's a win win, directors (good nd bad) and even someone who never made a movie in there life can crank out dreck for very little money and big profit. I think the floodgates are just opening time to head for higher ground.	8473382	Fri Mar 08 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is That a Movie or Video Game?

John Bell	2	0	CGI and special effects are the extensions of puppet, mask, and object theater into the digital age. Rather than asking audiences to focus on actors, such methods prefer a primary focus on moving sculptures, painted images, shadows, projected images or other aspects of the material world. This should not be a problem: since the beginnings of human culture performers and audiences have created great works of art, ritual, and performance by using images and objects in motion. Understanding the precedents and current kin of CGI as puppet, mask, and object theater might help us understand the actual nature, dynamics, and aesthetics of the newer digital forms.

David Bartlett	4	0	Today's hyper-enhanced CGI extravaganzas are not movies, they are video games, where the effects themselves are the featured attraction. It is sensory overload-----pacing, story, character development take a back seat to this new aesthetic. One can easily imagine some twenty- or thirty-something director, succored from birth on the slash-and-burn intensity of video games----and in the case of the very youngest in Hollywood, on MOVIES that have already been styled on such games-----working themselves into a frenzy on a computer, overdosing on special-effects software and whiz-bang CGI. One even imagines that it is the CGI that comes first------waking up in the middle of the night with an 'Oh, wow, that would be AWESOME!' kind of idea, they then build a movie around it only afterward. It is a new language, a new vernacular, of the filmmakers art. Whether anyone but the youngest speak this tongue is a moot point. As the saying goes, if you have to ask, you can't afford it. In this case, if you don't 'get' this new sensibility, you're not relevant in the first place.	8470645	Fri Mar 08 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is That a Movie or Video Game?

Michael Sapko	4	0	"This statement by the author: ""One concern is that releasing genetically engineered mosquitoes could even make the dengue situation worse, perhaps by reducing immunity to the more serious form of the disease."" is not entirely accurate. The study cited (the link is kindly provided) actually indicates that a vaccination program should be conducted before releasing GM mosquitos in places with high wild type mosquito density. Otherwise cases of a lethal form of dengue fever could increase. The paper does not state that releasing GM mosquitos actually makes matters worse in a general sense. In fact, the modeling presented in the paper shows that combining the two approaches (vaccination and GMO release) reduce both types of dengue fever, much more than one or the other treatment used alone. I admire the use of peer-reviewed research to substantiate arguments, but the author has the responsibility to do it properly."	14217680	Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 CET 2015	Can Genetically Modified Bugs Save Lives?

But the high-income well-educated suburban-raised millenials flocking to SF and NYC and other cities, with jobs in tech, finance, media (and often financial help from parents) are doing pretty well. They feel pretty entitled to enjoy their delayed adulthood with their disposable income in bars, food delivery and chain stores. This demographic tsunami has displaced low and middle income residents of formerly intact neighborhoods in SF and NYC. But their delayed adulthood has other impacts as well - the affluent 20 and 30 somethings have little interest in civic issues, in voting.

This would not be an option if parents were not going along with this. I hear over and over people saying ""I'm afraid he'll end up homeless or in a shelter"". Perhaps hitting rock bottom is what these young people need as a wake-up call."	13678631	Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 CET 2014	Adulthood, Delayed or Forgone?

Southern Boy	3	0	Milliennials burdened by college debt? They chose to take out that debt. Nobody forced them to do that. They made a choice to go into serious debt and now they must accept it and figure out how to deal with it. That's part of the growing up thing. Before they selected a college to attend, they should have sat down with their parents and determined which college was most affordable for them, not which college would be the grooviest to attend. Most of the issues facing the millennials result from the choices they have made over the course of their lives. Too bad they don't have truly serious issues facing them, like the possibility of being drafted and sent off to fight America's overseas wars. There's an example of somebody else making a choice for you that you have absolutely no choice in the matter, other than defying the law, going to prison (like Muhammad Ali), or leaving the country. I don't today's younger generation has the courage to make those kinds choices because it may disrupt their social media activity.	13686111	Sun Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2014	Adulthood, Delayed or Forgone?

Candide33	8	0	People used to have to have children in their teens and 20s because people didn't live very long and if they were to pass on their genes, they had to get to it early. People used die early, sixty was old but now people live a lot longer so there is no hurry. People also used to have as many kids as they could because so many died in childhood, modern medicine has put an end to the need for that. Maybe it is just natural part of human evolution as people have become more educated and science has solved many of the problems of dieing off before life could be fully lived.	13679960	Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 CET 2014	Adulthood, Delayed or Forgone?

India	11	0	No one can ever truly afford to have a child. Mankind would have died out eons ago if we'd all waited. But then we lived VERY modestly on one income so we had no child care expenses. Anyone who graduates from college with 6 figure student loans is a fool - there are ways to get a college education without doing that. I agree that those with only a high school diploma absolutely must delay children until they achieve some financial stability - if they don't, they'll have a lifetime of poverty. But all these college-educated young who are delaying parenthood until their forties so they can obtain all the material things they desire and take all the trips are only fooling themselves. This is financial responsibility - this is an avoidance of adulthood.	13678655	Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 CET 2014	Adulthood, Delayed or Forgone?

Observer	15	0	I believe there may be a significant geographical disparity regarding the entry into adulthood as described in the article. Having worked in the Midwest for the past 5 years amidst a predominantly millennial workforce, I (a now retired baby boomer from New England) was shocked over how many were getting married, having multiple children and committing themselves to a conservative/traditional career path before they reached 30. I particularly noticed that the workforce crowd in the large high rise downtown office buildings in Minneapolis were of the same general age for the most part. There were vey few folks with gray hair such as myself. Perhaps this is just the way the Midwest has always been, but I found it surprising, and a bit disheartening that these folks were already middle aged in my eyes, having committed themselves to a sentence of 30 plus years in office space drudgery without testing the waters of their youth.	13681232	Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 CET 2014	Adulthood, Delayed or Forgone?

Andrea	5	0	The issue of climate change is much more important to people of my generation (millennials and younger Gen Xers) then other generations since we are going to be the ones to live with the consequences of rising sea levels, species extinction, and the other impacts of this disaster. Thus many of us are trying to live more sustainable lives, which often means turning our backs on suburbia, car culture and over-consumption. Choosing biking, car sharing companies like ZipCar, and living downtown means not only helping the climate and environment but spending less money on a car, which is one of the worst investments a young person can make because of depreciation and expensive car loans. In another part of today's Times, there's an article about predatory lending in the used car loan industry. I think taking part in the sharing economy and other alternative ways of consuming shows a lot of maturity and responsibility that older generations could learn from.	13681084	Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 CET 2014	Adulthood, Delayed or Forgone?

Bob	1	0	I'm a regular, everyday biker. And in my experience, most cities have a variety of acceptable ways to get around on a bike. New York is different. The one-way avenues are hazardous, even for experienced bikers. Other than the West Side Highway, there are actually very few safe routes to take around Manhattan. A few strategically chosen routes can make a big difference here. But there are still not enough safe ways to get through Midtown. Maybe there never will be; Midtown is very congested.	3150627	Mon Jan 03 00:00:00 CET 2011	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?	Mayor Koch's bicycle network died quickly.

Anne	2	0	NYC should be using its resources for mass transit - not bicycles. Bicyclists are not former car drivers, they are former mass transit users. Bicycling will not reduce car use, but it will reduce mass transit use. Fewer mass transit users means it is easier to cut mass transit funding etc. Low income residents, the disabled and the elderly rely heavily on mass transit. Bicycling benefits young people. Cycling is great in low density European cities with low-rise buildings - but not in high-density NYC with one high-rise after another. The number of people (particular affluent people who are more likley to have cars, get deliveries such as Frsh Direct etc), the number of skyscrapers etc is the cause of car traffic in NYC.	3129760	Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

Robert	6	0	I am in my late fifties and have bicycle commuted most of my life. It began in college when my Bug broke down andI could not afford to fix it. I have vacationed on my bicycle, ridden to work on my bicycle, and gotten hurt too. But it is still the greatest form of transportation there is overall for health and the environment. The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd. It is so much more expensive to maintain automobile roads than those for cycle culture. Believe me, when the 5-6 dollar a gallon gas gets here, you will ride. And believe me, a couple of weeks of commuting or shopping with your bike will make you a believer! Riding your bike will also replace any membership at any fitness club around, and for far less cost than you would expect.	3125279	Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

Henry	4	0	Build it and they will come. New York City has had such a strong anti-bicycling stance for so many decades (remember Koch's midtown bike ban? remember when bicycling was prohibited on the GWB walkway?) that it's going to take awhile for some cyclists to start poking their heads out again. When less intrepid cyclists realize that bicycling is actually being encouraged, not discouraged, they'll give it a try. It's going to take time for the full value of dedicated bike lanes to be realized. Sorry, I can't sign onto the position of car advocates.

James	2	0	I think bike lanes are a very good idea. This will promote more bicycle riding in town and make riding safer. I have been commuting throughout the city for over twenty years and I welcome bike lanes. What I don't like is the design and implimentation of these lanes. We don't need islands separating bike lanes from car lanes. This makes it more dangerous for both rider and pedestrians. Pedestrians are often not looking when they cross through bike lanes. Also, the wasted space of in many areas around Time Square. The Broadway bike lane just stops at 47th Street! What's up with that? It all seems to be designed by someone that is not a seasoned rider.

anonymous	2	0	There are thousands of city residents that ride bicycles for work, such as messengers and food delivery men. Providing bike-only lanes not only allows for safety of these riders but also prevents the use of sidewalks by some of the law-breaking riders, which is a great hazard to pedestrians. I agree that it will take years for regular commuters to switch their mode of transportation to the bicycle, but allowing for this possibility is a great start. Don't forget that bicycle-friendly cities like Amsterdam have a system of public bicycles as well, which helps promote this eco and health-friendly mode of transportation. Finally, if car congestion and revenue for the city are problematic issues, perhaps we can implement a carpool system that only allows free access into Manhattan to cars with multiple passengers and would charge a toll for single drivers.	3124932	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

Dave	2	0	New York's bike lanes are off to a great start but still have a long way to go in terms of safety. Car owners here are beginning to get the idea about bicycles but still quite often traverse into bike lanes without looking or without caring. If we really want a cleaner, healthier city then we need to limit the number of automobiles driven here. I also see plenty of cyclist commuters in the winter months. I myself am one. Cycling should be treated as a annual endeavor. Limiting it to warmer temperatures would prove to be dangerous and fatal for a number of riding commuters and enthusiasts. And in general cyclists are a friendly bunch and I'm sure would be willing to work with business owners to facilitate their needs as well.	3124349	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

hs	5	0	As a pedestrian, I've found the new bike lanes make me less safe - even if they increase safety for bicyclists. This is because bicyclists tend to use the bike lanes to go the wrong way on a one-way street. Pedestrians must cross through the bike lanes to get across the street, and with bikes coming full-speed in the wrong direction, this creates a serious safety hazard. As for the new bike lane along Columbus Avenue - I rarely see any bicyclists using the lane, as most still prefer the street. The few bicycles I've seen in the lane have, in fact, been going the wrong way.	3124192	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?	Mayor Koch's bicycle network died quickly.

I applaud the city for taking a bold stance. To those who say bikes are dangerous, I'm aware there have been deaths but give me a break. You're telling me a car is somehow safer for a pedestrian? Bikes improve safety (dedicated bike lane build outs slow down drivers), improve public health and give us more mobility options! And the drawbacks are less parking places and slower moving cars... big deal. And for the note by the writer that biking is a 3 season activity... nonsense. Unless there is nasty ice build up everywhere, put on a hat and stop bellyaching. I'm still biking to work even in our unseasonably cold December. And guess what?

Adam	13	0	I'm a native New Yorker who, in years past, never would have biked in the city because of fear for my safety. However, because of the new bike lanes, I now feel safe enough to bike around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. This summer, I bought a bike for the first time. Yesterday -- December 21 -- I biked 13 miles to visit my parents in Manhattan, riding 75% of the way on bike lanes. The assertions that (a) the bike lanes don't help move people from cars and public transit to bikes, (b) bikers stop using the lanes in the colder months, and (c) bikers prefer non-bike-laned streets are all false in my case. Which is more likely: that I'm an outlier, or that a program that encourages people to bike by making streets safer for bikers and supplying new bikers with free maps of safe routes around the city is actually working as Bloomberg claims it is?	3123078	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

These are all young people (I'm in my late sixties) going to work. They are the not the spandex cyclist that appear on the weekend. When I worked the bike took me to the Con ed powerhouses throughout the city. The bike lanes were in there infancy some twenty years ago.

Margarete	47	0	When I moved from the US to Berlin, with its enviable public transportation system, I didn't ride a bike for two years. Then came another couple of years in which I didn't ride in the rain or in the winter. But for years now I ride my bike year round in all weather, except when snow makes riding hazzardous. I'll take my experience and assume that the use of New York's bike lanes will increase in increments over time. It's too early to say that they are merely a 'subsidy for the few.' One person sitting in a gigantic, unwieldy vehicle is still just one person, and that person doesn't have a right to own the infrastructure everyone is paying for, based solely on the virtue of taking up a lot of space. I think the most frustrating thing for car drivers who dislike the bike lanes is that they cannot justify their behavior in a city with so many alternatives to driving. Not in this day and age. The bikers present a slap in the face to every rationalization for driving a car.	3122168	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?	Mayor Koch's bicycle network died quickly.

I love biking in the city, but I cannot go very fast in the bike lanes because sheeple (usually on cell phones), dogs on long leads, and cars (with drivers usually on cell phones) seem to be oblivious. They stagger in and out of our lanes like zombies. I can ride much faster and safer when I ride with the cars in the car lanes. People on cell phones and dogs on long leads are afraid of cars. As a biker, I use that fear to my advantage. The only other way I can imagine getting people to pay attention to where they are, might be to add some heft and/or pointy things to bikes, so that when a pedestrian wanders in front of one they might be impaled or knocked good and hard. That might learn them to look up from their mindless daze.	3122701	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?	Mayor Koch's bicycle network died quickly.

Gary Taustine	11	0	If I wanted to live in Copenhagen I would move there. NYC is not some utopian, hippie commune for the anti-car crowd, this is a city built upon business, where people need to actually get around in a hurry. Mayor Bloomberg is just making matters worse with his futile attempts to change the way we all behave either by force, cost or inconvenience. Despite his best efforts, the Mayor can not be Mayor forever, and after all of his heavy-handed attacks on personal freedoms, New Yorkers may be ready for someone who just balances the budget and leaves them alone. I know I am. We pay a lot of money to live in NYC - we should have the right to smoke, drive cars, eat salt and drink soda. I think Mr. Bloomberg needs to be President, because as Mr. Obama has demonstrated, the President can't change a thing.	3122062	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

melty	3	0	"HT (#27): ""So many other bikers that I have observed have this inflated sense of self-entitlement, like they are doing a favor for the environment."" Cyclists' attitudes notwithstanding (YMMV), are you off your rocker? Of COURSE cyclists are doing a huge favor for the environment. Can you say ""asthma""? or ""particulate pollution""? Not to mention lung-cringing CO, heat-trapping CO2, PAHs, or the sheer waste of precious oil (and human lives) in dragging a tonne of steel, rubber, plastic, and glass around just to move a single person. Car drivers are the spoiled and subsidized minority here -- that is what the CM people are getting at I think: the unspoken and unwritten assumption that the privilege of driving a car should be considered a right. After all, the first tarmac roads were built for bikes, not for cars."	3129951	Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?	Mayor Koch's bicycle network died quickly.

JDavid	11	0	I commute to work by bicycle every morning up 1st ave, and every evening home down 2nd. I have done so every day, year-round for over a decade. Before that in Boston, Chicago, and Rome. Had a couple close calls riding over the last 25 years, but nothing extraordinary. To date, nothing has threatened my life with greater intensity or frequency than the consequences of these bike lanes. They are death traps for cyclists, pure and simple. NYC bike lanes have been paved with good intentions... that's the best I can say about them.	3122362	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

B.	1	0	Look, I've been riding my bike in Brooklyn for over half a century -- and on Cape Cod. The bike lane on Prospect Park West is an eyesore. Look back from the old Sanders Theater towards Grand Army Plaza -- you'll see that the cars parked in what used to be the third lane throw off the straight line running to the monument. I'm the sort who for years has been unplugging electronics to save electricity, keeping my house at 60 degrees in winter, and relying only on ceiling fans in summer. Not liking the bike land isn't being a NIMBY. It's recognizing that some beauty has been lost.	3526042	Sun Mar 13 00:00:00 CET 2011	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

lisa	2	0	yes, let's hate cyclists: people who get off their ass and ride, staying fit as they get around the city. they don't pollute the air, they don't create noise, they don't create street after street clogged with cars dripping oil... I think the people who hate cyclists are the same ones who hate dogs: they have tiny little shards of coal where their heart once was. they can't move fast or laugh, and want no one else to, either. According to the DMV, in 2009 there were 75,539 automobile crashes in New York City, less than 4 percent of those crashes involved a bicycle. cyclists are clearly the problem here.	3495324	Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CET 2011	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

Jay	3	0	I bike regularly as exercise and have experimented with the city's initiative , attempting to bike to work. My commute is not long, from the west 100's to 60th st and Madison and so can even take advantage of central park as well as the bike lanes. I soon found that on the rare occasions when I could bike successfully without some heart stopping near or actual accident which most often caused by pedestrians not looking at bike lanes, that when I did arrive at my destination there were few if any places to lock my bike. So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment. I am afraid my experience is not unique. I expect that unless proper parking locking facilities are provided in sufficient amount and locations the experiment will continue to serve a very small part of the population. As the accidents and injuries add up the city will eventually be forced to abandon this wasteful poorly thought out experiment..	3127716	Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

They're not really permitted to use the sidewalks. Bicycles are also the most sensible means of transportation for a good percentage of city residents and workers.

JANE WEBB	3	0	This city is being destroyed by cars and their pollution. The no idling laws are never enforced and drivers obliviously idle while making cell phone calls or sleeping or doing any number of things. Bikes have a zero carbon footprint or as close to it as you can get. Why are we deferring to the drivers? why is a 3000 pound hunk of toxic gas emitting metal more important than a bike. The bike is clearly superior in that it respects the environment creating no air or noise pollution.To revert back to a bike lane free city is to go back into the dark ages of this city. The paradigm must change.Drivers need to realize that one person on a bike is just as important as one person in a car.They are just two people trying to get where they are going..one quietly and the other creating a swath of noise and filth behind them. It is selfish and unfair for a single driver in a vehicle to insist that they deserve more of the street than the thousands who have risked their lives to do their part to help save the environment.

HC	1	0	Columbus is an absolute mess every morning except, of course, for the actual green bicycle lanes. The avenue is a virtual parking lot, the buses are stuck. The sidewalks are teeming, but the green lanes are virtually empty, especially with the cold weather. I am sure bus service will soon be cut since they take up too much room, cause too much congestion and can't move anyway. But that's okay. After all, if you wanna get somewhere, his Highness has provided bicycle lanes! Imagine turning all that space into bus lanes. That could be green and efficient and... oh yeah, the city would have to provide buses for the lanes, never mind. I can't wait to experience the first major snowstorm with the new bicycle lanes when Columbus will be reduced to a single lane!	3126508	Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

Brian	4	0	To No. 96, I am well aware that current NY law treats bikes and cars as the same and expects bikes to obey the exact same laws as cars. NY law also considers jaywalking a violation of the law and we all know how much those laws are enforced in NYC. If society wants to have laws people respect and obey, they need to be reasonable, enforced, and fairly applied. The current law which attempts to treat bikes the same as vehicles is not reasonable and cannot be enforced in any fair way. Just as it would be impossible to enforce jaywalking laws in NYC. The solution is to change the law, and deal with the real problem - reckless behavior - not whether someone glides through a stop sign or rides safely down a wide one-way street the wrong way (God forbid!) when it presents a danger to no one.	3126129	Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

SIMONE	3	0	Imagine if wearing seatbelts was controversial. Bike lanes are necessary for safety and the reason why one lane suddenly stops is because some community boards fight against bike lanes - especially in Brooklyn. They don't want to give up a car lane like on Prospect Park West, so they make up some crap about safety, as though there are hundreds of cyclists knocking people over. Most cyclists who use the protected lanes are polite and content that they feel safe and abide by the rules. It's the cyclists who don't use the lanes that are a problem - they ride too fast, arrogantly riding against traffic, don't look up. We all have to drive carfefully. Pedestrians need to stop texting as they cross the street. Everyone - pay attention!	3126051	Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?	Mayor Koch's bicycle network died quickly.

Peter C	2	0	Bike lanes make a very clear message that bikers are not second class road users, as pedestrians are, in most cities. Thankfully New York, along with Montreal, has the wisdom to prohibit right turns on a red light.

bonnidel	1	0	The bike lanes are a fantastic idea - but there needs to be strict enforcement of traffic laws for cyclists. Many show no regard for red lights, one way streets, or for even using the lanes. Getting out of a car or cab is hazardous as many cyclists do not use the bike lanes and instead use the other side of the street and then complain when doors open etc. and endager them. Similarly, one now has to assume that a cyclist will ride through an intersection regardless of the traffic light, endagering pedestrians.	3123867	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

Nothing Better to do	11	0	Do bike lanes and additional bike traffic make conditions for car traffic worse? Of course they do. Should we support it? Yes.

Should we support it? No. The more bike riders, the less cars, the less danger, and a greener planet. This car centric attitude is the real root cause to the gridlock problem in the city, not the introduction of more efficient, greener and overall safer transportation.	3123554	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

tominny	4	0	"I hate bike lanes because they slow me down and inhibit my flow with the traffic. And pedestrians wander into bikes lanes because they think they are not part of the road. Happens to me all the time. Some walker without even looking just ambles off the sidewalk, his back to me, right in front of my path. Also when traffic turns through a bike lane this involves extra lights and a real cluster mix situation for everyone. And don't get me started about trucks parking in cycle lanes to unload - all the time. And lastly, the worst is car drivers get to shout ""get in the bike lane"" now when I""m going around a truck or something. Bloomberg's ideas have little to do with reality, he's green the way most billionaires are green. One other thing, those electric bikes, they are a true menace.

PT	14	0	The only thing that makes bikes in the city absolutely maddening is the fact that bike riders do not obey traffic rules. They just plain don't. Every time I hit the streets on foot I have to dodge a cyclist who is ignoring a red light, riding the wrong way on a one-way street, riding on the sidewalk, making a turn on a red light and on and on. No one monitors them or makes them face the consequences of the hazards they pose. The recent proliferation of bike rental businesses is a sign that the mayor wants this in a bad way. The people who rent cycles to tourists don't bother telling them they aren't allowed to ride on the sidewalks or the footpaths in central Park. The pedicabs are now just as bad and they're carrying naive tourists in the back seat on a ride to catastrophe.	3123005	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

Why is the onus only on the motor vehicle driver, when they are in their lanes, and going very slowly in Manhattan,(now more than ever because of constricted lanes), and getting ticketed for not obeying traffic rules. Try saying that about cyclists; not in lanes, going the wrong way in lanes, not obeying traffic lights and signs. And do you think the cyclist is at fault when there's an accident? Of course a driver's insurance is going to go up! So let's level the playing field. Let's require license, registration and insurance for bicycles and their users.

Sunny20	35	0	If the Koch lanes had stayed in place, NY would have developed a bike culture years ago. He quit too soon. The key is segregating bikes from cars. The cement barriers of the Koch lanes would have defined the boundaries and let everyone know where they belonged and did not belong. Establishing bike only cross town and north-south streets would tick off motorists, but certainly create safer transportation. It is time for change. Cyclists need to be as accountable as cab drivers when they do stupid, and the rest of us need to learn how to deal with positive change.	3122181	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

I'm not saying do away with cars overnight, nor am I saying that it's feasible for everyone to ride a bike wherever they go. But I do think that, eventually, the population will, out of necessity, need to shed the idea that people should drive a car to wherever they need to go forever. The sooner we start encouraging the use of walking and biking, the better off we'll all be.	3123993	Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Are New York's Bike Lanes Working?

Now that the 10% rule in in effect, Hispanic students from the barrio schools are, for the first time, getting acceptance letters.

WJ	2	0	What we should be looking for are fairer opportunities and more equal outcomes. Race-based admissions are not about outcomes but about a preference. It's revanchist - plain and simple. It's taking away slots from low-income white kids with high aptitude and giving them to middle-income black kids with mediocre aptitude. It's punishing them for something they had nothing to do with. If you can't understand that then you'll never understand the powder-keg of white resentment in red state america. Poor kids deserve a leg up because being poor saddles kids with a whole host of disadvantages that they didn't ask for. To say that rich, black kids deserve a leg up because they're black shows a serious lack of a sense of irony.	11674084	Tue Apr 29 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Affirmative Action Be Based on Income?

If you replaced race with income, the right people would be helped. In the current system, people who don't need the preferences get all the benefit to the detriment of those that deserve it.

Hamburger	4	0	Affirmative Action by race was and still is both necessary and Constitutional in America. Equal protection means that public universities - which use public money - must take into account how bias has played a role in preparing students for college. Blacks and Hispanics are not stupid, rather, they are disadvantaged in school and life, beyond school. Yes, this means that a better student won't get into college, but that's okay because democracy includes sacrifice. Every soldier ever drafted lost their most sacred rights because we sent them off to war. So, stop whining about being white and not getting into college because of Affirmative Action.	11669549	Mon Apr 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Affirmative Action Be Based on Income?

Bob K.	1	0	I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in.	11670926	Mon Apr 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Affirmative Action Be Based on Income?

Michael	3	0	"""Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race."" Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to."	11670592	Mon Apr 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Affirmative Action Be Based on Income?

Of course going to college is the furtherest thing from their minds. And due to the huge amount of family discord, abuse, and dysfunction out there, the numbers of lost children and lost potential--that eventually affects us all in one way or another--is no doubt staggering. Therefore, somehow helping this group overcome their challenges so they can likewise move forward and fulfill their potential should also somehow become an offshoot goal of Affirmative Action as it struggles to redefine itself.	11668966	Mon Apr 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Affirmative Action Be Based on Income?

However, ss the authors point out, ""If a socioeconomic plan is designed well, it can even achieve greater levels of minority representation than a race-only program.""

Meredith	1	0	If the income based achievement gap is now 2x the size of the race gap, that attests to our under-funding of education, and to our economic policies that create new lower classes for all races for decades. The living standards and security of all have been on a downward path. This shouldn't cancel race affirmative action, since that is an extra layer of roadblocks in the upward path for minorities. Economic policies of the conservatives have for years been working against the gains blacks made in past decades. So even if more whites are poor or near poor than before, still race affirmative action still has a realistic purpose and need. Our legal racial apartheid is all too recent-in my lifetime. And the policies and political messages of our dominant conservative party have still been amplifying negative race messages, using them to win elections.	11666845	Mon Apr 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Affirmative Action Be Based on Income?

That said, what is old is new. Ask any long time New Yorker, and they will tell you about the beat cop, who knew what was going on, and knew who were the troublemakers, and knew how to deal with them appropriately. While it is a different era now, someone with a quality of life crime (like selling illegal cigarettes) can be dealt with by basically telling them to get lost and not show his face on 'his' street again. There are ways of using the force and power of the law without arresting people. If the person doesn't get the hint, or otherwise acts out, you always have the arrest as a backup, but most low level people will avoid the confrontation.	12408099	Mon Jul 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Is 'Broken Windows' a Broken Policy for Police?

People are happier when they know their enforcement of the law is building bridges in communities that may need help. Everyone deserves objective feedback, no one deserves to be abused. Broken windows should be a policy of fixing little things and not draconian punishment for little failures. Cleaning up graffiti, getting kids off the street, and reducing sensational adult advertisement in family communities; those are broken windows.

Jim R.	1	0	Agree that it would be beneficial to separate ops from analysis organizationally, but fusion centers are important during times of crisis and have been very successful in DOD in getting different organizations to work together toward a common goal without compromising the parent organizations. Regards leadership, the DCI is not normally a CIA lifer, so outsider leadership is often the norm now (Brennan excepted). I think an outsider could lead a newly formed analytic organization, but an outsider would have great difficulty leading ops, as understanding what case officers go thru is essential to having the credibility to lead such an organization. Plus, an outsider not steeped in ops would be easy to snow by career operators. Picking the right operator is more important, from my perspective.	13664824	Tue Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2014	Do We Need the C.I.A.?

Otherwise we get a pendulum swinging from one ethos to another, with the result the intelligence and other agents are given too much freedom and too little real moral support.	13653875	Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2014	Do We Need the C.I.A.?

dan eades	12	0	Yes. The C.I.A. should be dismantled. The organization has proven to be completely corrupt. The C.I.A. is filled with people who have condoned and performed acts of torture. We can not allow such people to run our premier intelligence organization. Either give their powers to another organization (there are too many in any case) or start a new one with strict congressional oversight. The C.I.A., starting with its conception, has been a plaything for a certain social class with no sense of responsibility to the country or to its ideals. And they have failed us over and over and over. The Bay of Pigs, 9/11, Iraq and the Weapons of Mass Destruction, ISIS, come immediately to mind. The assassination program (of foreign leaders, e.g. Castro) and the torture program are two of the grisliest of their incredible schemes. The organization should be disbanded and the architects of torture punished.	13650290	Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2014	Do We Need the C.I.A.?

Jim Miara	1	0	Mr. Kornbluth asserts that CIA agents are dedicated individuals whose only goal is to serve and defend the country. That statement is as empty as a whiskey barrel at an Appalachian stomp festival. How does one serve the country? Do you serve the country by violating its fundamental principles with torture, even if it yields, which it didn't, helpful information? Are you defending the country by inciting terrorist groups who use your crimes as recruiting tools? The CIA missed the collapse of the Soviet Union. It missed the 9/11 attack; it led us into a war with Iraq by supporting false intelligence; it missed the upheavals in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests? It seems very clear their definition is consistent with the Barry Goldwater/ Neocons/Dick Cheney dictum: Excess in defense of liberty is no vice. And this, of course, profoundly and utterly misses the point.	13659246	Tue Dec 23 00:00:00 CET 2014	Do We Need the C.I.A.?

Samuel Spade	3	0	Yes,America needs an effective intelligence agency in these times when their are large threats, continual crises, and highly technical developments to keep up with. We don't necessarily need the exact agency we have now. Give some of its staff and actions back to State and DOD. Require what remains to be absolutely disconnected from politics and totally law abiding. The director and his highest assistants should be prepared to resign the moment they are asked to partake of an illegal action, or one unjustified in defense of the country. Legal action for offenders would be mandatory. We don't need an agency to spy on other branches of the government and even the Congress in its own interest and then declare itself immune from prosecution.

LBJr	13	0	During those 3 decades of service under disparate presidents our country has bumbled into one after another military fiasco serving corporate interests more than American security. Our CIA is a terror maker... by making terrorists and by using terror tactics. I see the need for secrecy and intelligence gathering, but this offensive, off-the-books paramilitary organization combined with a totally unconstitutional intelligence gathering division is so undemocratic it makes my teeth hurt. My advice to you is to limit your exposure to Fox News, quit watching reruns of 24 and Homeland, and think about what Jesus would do. Also, your reasoning for why the agency is indispensable makes no sense. We need the CIA because America needs security, not because it has tech toys and a dedicated staff with good intentions.	13652021	Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2014	Do We Need the C.I.A.?

Glendon	6	0	"The CIA reminds me by its recent actions of the old joke, ""Military Intelligence is a contradiction in terms."" To the extent that the CIA has become militarized and lawless, (which is the real reason that the prison at Guantanemo was established, so that torture could take place without the oversight of U.S. law) it has become a detriment to the nation, and a blot on the United States' reputation. We should disband the CIA and assign its responsibilities to civilians who will obey the laws and understand the consequences of covert actions to our foreign relations. The State Department should be well up to the task. Faulty intelligence leads to lost wars and continual embarrassment for the politicians who rely on it. The CIA should have no ties to the Department of Defense, so that operations can be unfettered by a military mindset."	13651841	Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2014	Do We Need the C.I.A.?

The CIA has always been above the law, uncontrollable and unaccountable. It is responsible for more crimes against humanity than any other organization or government, orchestrating civil wars, coups, establishing brutal dictatorships from Guatemala to Chile to Iran, training and overseeing death squads and torture around the globe. It is past time to abolish this monstrous institution along with its other faces; NSA, NATO, USAID and put intelligence gathering back in the military with heavy, independent oversight to prevent abuse.

Uzi Nogueira	1	0	It would be much easier to dismantle or close down the C.I.A. instead of reforming a humongous bureaucratic para-military-intelligence organization that has lost its basic mission statement. That is, collect and analyze material/information from foreign countries, friends or foes, and provide the political leadership with useful intelligence material to defend and protect the national security of the United States. The CIA involved in war crimes and torture comes at no surprise to any person over 40 living in Africa, Asia and Latin America. During the cold war, the agency was the main instrument of foreign policy used by the White House to destabilize unfriendly third world governments or fight proxy wars against the Soviet Union. Torture techniques were honed during that time. What to do with the CIA? downsize that humongous dysfunctional organization, retrain its personnel to do real intelligence data collection to protect the national security of the US.

NATO is showing its true purpose at last: maintain the Western imperial hegemony. Turkey is an important an anti-Russian outpost. Who cares if Turkey does not recognize its own Armenian genocide? Who cares if it stole the country that Kurds were supposed to have and then tried to obliterate the Kurdish identity altogether? Who cares if it nurtured the Syrian civil war? Who cares if it suffocates its own democratic institutions as it transitions into Putin-like authoritarianism? We need Turkey to stick to the Russians.

Leo Hevia	2	0	Lift the embargo? What for? The Castro brothers and their sycophants are deeply entrenched and are not going anywhere, with or without an embargo. Lifting the embargo will just make them even...wealthier than they already are. Those two despicable hypocrites call themselves Communists and are living in luxury while most on the island struggle everyday to survive. And don't kid yourselves, they have ruled with an iron fist for 54 years and have executed thousands, and thousands of people without batting an eyelash in order to stay in power. Many, many more have perished in the high seas trying to escape. Many lives lost, families destroyed, misery, poverty, hunger, and for what? What kind of a revolution was that?	13047146	Tue Oct 14 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Hitting 'Restart' With Cuba	Should the U.S. lift sanctions and establish diplomatic relations with Cuba?	/roomfordebate/2014/10/12/should-the-us-normalize-relations-with-cuba	The U.S. should lift sanctions with Cuba	The U.S. should not lift sanctions with Cuba	false	false	The U.S. should not lift sanctions with Cuba

So far Cuba is no longer in the Soviet Union orbit and there's a lot of change in the government's behavior since Fidel Castro is no longer in front of the executive of the Comunist Party. I think Mr. Montaner should pay more attention to the latest polls in the UN against the embargo, the solidarity of the cuban doctors, and the progress and investments a lot of countries are taking inside the island, if america doesn't take this chance to lift the embargo he will pass thru history once again as the could-have-done but-never-did disappointing administration of Mr. Obama.	13044921	Tue Oct 14 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Hitting 'Restart' With Cuba	Should the U.S. lift sanctions and establish diplomatic relations with Cuba?	/roomfordebate/2014/10/12/should-the-us-normalize-relations-with-cuba	The U.S. should lift sanctions with Cuba	The U.S. should not lift sanctions with Cuba	true	false	The U.S. should lift sanctions with Cuba

We must remember that Cuba was one of our most important trading partners at the time the embargo was imposed. The embargo had a direct impact on the decline of southern economies.

Yoda	2	0	The new Greek govt must do 2 things. One is to negotiate a decrease (or restructuring to longer payment terms) of its debt. That is the immediate problem. The new Govt. may or may not be able to do this. That will depend on how the negotiations go with the creditors. Simultaneously, and very importantly however, Greece must undergo serious economic reforms. For example the creation of a land registry, a stop to political vote buying by politicians, a stop to corruption, the creation of an apolitical statistical service, a non-pollitcal civil servant based on merit instead of cronyism, etc. Does the new Govt show any signs of this (beyond rheteric)? Absolutely not. There are no signs that a land registry will be created, that merit will be the basis of a civil service, that a non-political statistical service will be created or that an effective tax collection agency will be set up.

Syriza's defiance of the rest of Europe (though many countries in the south will try to emulate Greek intransigence) will be an enormous, even ultimate stress test for the European Union. If only the aid to Greece had gone to the people and not the banks and hedge funds that to be paid off, things would look different. Syriza takes a cheap route, blaming the Troika, the Germans. They do not change the corrupt Greek way of dealing with their own crisis. Even in Syriza there are many who will seek profit from Greek's demise.

Having now done it at little cost; that's an open invitation to the next opening. The Europeans need to unite and provide themselves a meaningful alternative. Not a 4,000 man trip wire complete with busses to drive forward and back and a band to play at their own embarrassing surrender. Putin put 40-70,000 troops on the Ukraine border in days. The boots on the ground to balance that out needs to come from the Europeans with US support maybe, but not US leadership.

Reality-Check	3	0	This debater, and his opinion in this article, betray a very weak understanding of history. Nato expanded into the former Soviet Union long ago. The majority of the former Soviet Block eastern European countries are already part of NATO. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe, and potentially one of the Richest, if you do not count the European portion of Russia. Standing by, and not helping Ukraine to defended itself against Russia, would be wrong from national security, economic and moral points of view. Forcing Russia to expose itself as an extremely dangerous, immoral, and brutal country that no other country should trust, should be the minimum price Russia must pay to invade and occupy Ukraine. Send Ukraine arms, intelligence and money. Let them defend their own country, without a stacked deck.	12770824	Wed Sep 10 00:00:00 CEST 2014	NATO Challenge on the Edge of Its Mandate	Should NATO be defending a nonmember nation like Ukraine?

Victor	1	0	One must consider that in 1992, the year Ukraine gained independence from the former USSR, it held the world's third largest nuclear weapons arsenal. The government realized it would not be able to property maintain this arsenal and agreed, by treaty, to relinquish it on the basis that the USA and UK agreed to defend its territorial integrity. Even then, the country feared that Russia would attempt to invade or otherwise seize its lands. The unintended message from not assisting Ukraine is that other countries will recognize the importance of nuclear weapons, and will hold on to existing arsenals or attempt to develop one. Such passive encouragement of nuclear arms proliferation is contrary to the stated policy of the Western world to promote the reduction of such weapons. Who will trust the US when approached to eliminate its nuclear arms program?	12770803	Wed Sep 10 00:00:00 CEST 2014	NATO Challenge on the Edge of Its Mandate	Should NATO be defending a nonmember nation like Ukraine?

Shaun	4	0	Declawing is something one should never do. If a person is concerned about a cat scratching children in defense (or their furniture) then adopt a cat which is declawed. There are plenty in shelters and rescue homes which would benefit from a permanent home. If you cannot do that, don't get a cat. I applaud those who give cats homes, but it makes no sense to subsequently maim and emotionally scar these same pets.	17021307	Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

lightpath116	3	0	I have had cats, not now. The last two I had declawed. The first after a sofa we liked had to be recovered. It was either declaw or put down the cat. With the second one I made the decision so I would not have to either recover or put a cat down. Since both cats were indoor cats that NEVER went out I was not concerned with self defense. Only the front paws were declawed. Cats should not be let out in my view. They kill way too many birds.

Sara	10	0	It's absolutely horrifying how people can defend this. There are no excuses to perform this kind of painful and unnecessary amputation on any cat, ever. If people in other countries are able to have cats, indoor and outdoor, without this kind of barbaric practice, there should be no reason for it to be somehow needed n the US. And the idea that allowing declawing decreases the number of homeless cats is laughable, considering the massive problem with stray cats in america, where many european countries where it's illegal have the problem under much better control. And ask any shelter if they never see any declawed cats, and the answer will usually be the opposite. Declawed cats are abandoned regularly because of the behavior problems they develop due to pain and lacking their natural defense. I'd like to recommend everyone who wants to understand the issue better to watch the documentary The Paw Project, which shows just how much this kind of amputation hurts cats, the consequences, and how many of them need another surgery to somewhat repair their paws after the declawings.	17090878	Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

If a cat is going to be exclusively an indoor kitty, and the alternative is the destruction of most of your furniture, then this seems a reasonable choice to me as a last resort. My parents left me with an entire house full of badly scratched furniture (including a Steinway grand piano!) thanks to not wanting to get their cat de-clawed. In their later years the cat often scratched them as well. The only caveat I would have is that if the cat ever gets out and runs away, it is probably doomed with no defense against wildlife, dogs, whatever. My own cats can go outside, and of course have their claws intact.	17068275	Tue Dec 29 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Tracy	8	0	Declawing prevents cat overpopulation? Doubtful. I was a vet tech prior to becoming an RN. I have been physcially sick twice in the last 10 years of those careers....both times were as a vet tech. Neve as an ER nurse! Once was a shot puppy, another was a post op declaw. It was HORRIBLE. But clearly, sir, you need an anatomy class. You see cats don't reproduce via claws....1 cat can have 30  offspring in the wild.....my cats have the option to go outside (where they were found- cold, starving, wet, fighting for their lives in city streets) they don't want to go outside!!!! Why would they?? And personally I would rather buy 15 couches than live without any of my fur babies. I can't even believe you were allowed to write this article, as you are terribly misinformed.	17057400	Mon Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Raven Altona	9	0	Declawing should absolutely be illegal! It's not just nail removal, it's amputation of the third distal phalanges, or toe bones. It causes severe long lasting stress and pain. It puts the cat walking on its second toe bones, which are not meant to bear the full weight of the cat, causing muscle and tendon damage. It's the number one reason cats turn to biting and pottying outside the box. Many cats wind up in the pound because they were declawed and started biting or going outside the litter box. It's mutilation not convenience. It's cruelty, pure and simple.	17018730	Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Ellen Emerson	8	0	This man needs mental help. De-clawing a cat is NOT clipping her nails, it is cutting off part of the paw. It is painful, inhumane, and VERY often leads to biting and not using a litter box. Think about cutting off all your fingers at the first knuckle. That is de-clawing. It needs to be BANNED everywhere.	17017672	Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

JT Smith	2	0	I have a compromised immune system. If I could not adopt adult declawed cats, I could not have a cat. I've had three (two at the moment). They've all been different but not disturbed. They are great joys. If you oppose declawing, feel free not to declaw and not to adopt a declawed cat. If you want to campaign against declawing, go for it. But, do you really need the government to ban it?	17015769	Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

SB	8	0	The author is out of his freaking mind! Declawing,tail docking,ear cropping,docking cattle and sheep tails,mulesing and all other mutilations of animals for the human caretakers convenience should be outlawed! As for the declawing, have you never heard of The Paw Project? Do you have any idea what declawing does to a cat? What really needs to happen is Human Education ! I've had cats for over 20 years and raised hundreds of orphan kittens and have NEVER had any furniture,rugs etc destroyed by felines. From the time kittens can walk I filed/trimmed claws,have multiple cat trees and scratching posts and cardboard scratching boxes in the house.It is time for Mr. Beck to join the 21st century and start respecting animals.	17015098	Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Mrs T	5	0	I have owned five cats (more accurately, they owned me) in my adult life, and every one has been declawed. Each cat was rescued from a shelter, three were under a year old, and our current two had lived in a no-kill shelter for three years before coming to our home. My vet sends the cats home the day following surgery with a pain patch on, and the cats are very comfortable yet able to jump onto furniture and use their litter box. The patch falls off in a few days, and life goes on. All of my cats have been spayed/neutered and indoor animals, no exceptions allowed, and they live long, happy, spoiled lives. It's okay to care about my cats and the way my furniture looks, too.	17014864	Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Tuvw Xyz	3	0	"I am not a believer in ""animals' rights"". Right to something is a concept developed by humans within their society. But I am against mutilating animals for their owners' convenience, such as declawing a cat, surgically severing the voice chords of a loudly barking dog, cutting horns of goats or trimming the wings of birds. Remember the Golden Rule of Ethics in one of its versions, ""One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself""."	17014431	Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Mark E White	2	0	Bravo! cats with front claws often do terrible damage to furniture. While it is politically correct to object to it, the fact is there will be fewer homes for cats, who will end up being euthanized. The comparison isn't between an imaginary garden of Eden and declawing, but rather the choice is between more feral cats and more put down. Those of us who love cats don't want to see well-meaning humans decree that millions of cats suffer to meet the needs of humans.	17014122	Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Paul King	14	0	When I adopted my precious cat about 20 years ago, the women who had rescued it were thrilled that I said it would be an indoor cat. Free to roam my fenced back yard as I watched her. When I asked my veterinarian if a declaw was OK she said it would be fine from a medical, procedural and moral stand point because the after affects would be fine and the cat would not be defenseless as an indoor pet. I went back to the rescue ladies who were strong animal advocates and they were supportive of my desire to declaw. So, it was done. My cat and I had ten great years together and her inability to scratch me when holding her or playing with her endeared her to me all the more. If an owner of a cat has a similar situation as I had, I'd say it's not up to the state to meddle.	17013118	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Julia	9	0	"Completely inaccurate. The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. ""Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat"". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether.

Margaret	10	0	I have had 7 cats over the past 25  years--all rescues. I don't adopt kittens, only cats that are more than 9 months old, simply because there are so many adult cats who are surrendered. I have tried, with each cat, to train them to use a scratching post, put aluminum foil on couch arms, etc etc. NOTHING has worked (and being older cats, they were not amenable to having their nails clipped). All that banning declawing will do is force more and more cats into shelters. My cats have had no litter box issues, no aggression issues, and frankly, while I wouldn't declaw a cat older than 5 yrs, I have no guilt in declawing a young adult cat that then is an indoor-only pet. I understand it is painful but it is certainly less horrible than abandonment, the stress of being surrendered to a shelter (and really, there is a very low chance in many states for that adult cat to be adopted), and/or euthanasia.	17012435	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Peter Olafson	8	0	It never occurred to have our four cats declawed. Their claws are part of them and scratching is what cats do.

Erica	2	0	I've been host to two declawed cats while trying to find them a home (They came to me this way, it would never be my choice to do this). During their stay, one of them managed to kill two birds quite efficiently without claws. (They wiggled their way through the air conditioner). I didn't see him do it to know his methods, but I know it was him. Just last week, my toothless cat killed a bird that got in the same way. He killed it with one blow of his paw. He didn't use his claws to bring it down; just one blow and it was dead. I will only leave this piece of information, for I could write a book on declawing cats and the pain and problems it causes. There are plenty of safe alternatives to declawing; people need to research, and learn to live with animals instead of adapting them to fit our needs.	17012239	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Sarah	2	0	The top two reasons cats are turned into shelters are house soiling and aggression (biting). It is a well-known fact that declawed cats are deprived of their main form of defense (claws), and resort to biting. Additionally, it is painful for many declawed cats to dig in a litter box. Hence, house soiling. Shelters I have volunteered at have quite a few declawed cats come in due to these reasons, declawing being the source of these issues. Pet owners who want to declaw a cat should not have a cat--period. If you want to protect your furniture, do not own a cat. Cats naturally scratch. If dog owners don't want their animal to jump on their couches or beds, do they remove a dog's leg? If dog owners don't want a dog to bark, is debarking humane? It's the same thing as declawing a cat. Just don't have one.	17012077	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Diane	5	0	I am from the UK where declawing is outlawed. I had never heard of a declawed cat and moved to the USA in 1999. After Hurricane Katrina, there were a surplus of cats and dogs for adoption at our local shelter. I adopted two cats not knowing that one had declawed front paws. It took away the defenses of the declawed cat against the cat with intact claws - though he did like to get the clawed cat in a headlock and scratch with his hind paws. If you don't like scratched furniture, cats are not for you. You have to deal with the whole animal, not just the parts you like.	17011720	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Frances DiBisceglia	6	0	There are, of course, exceptions but declawing is inhumane and unnecessary and should only be used as a last resort, if all. One of my cats always uses her scratching post and her cardboard scratchpad while the other one has no interest in using them. Occasionally, he will scratch at the sofa but we used double sided tape and that deterred him. He doe claw at some other pieces but we do not care, they' re not nice anyway and often, manipulative fellow that he is, he does it for attention. Education is key here, cats need to use their claws for defense and instinct, and cat caregivers need to provide appropriate scratching places. We all need to make compromises, use a cover for the sofa if the mess bothers you. We make allowances for our messy children. Mutilation and amputation for our convenience is just wrong.	17011337	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

globalnomad	3	0	Declawing is unacceptable. A cat needs to go out a couple of times a day, just as we do, not least to relieve itself.

Barbara	3	0	Declawing is never a reasonable alternative,mutilating cats does not keep them in their homes just check any non kill animal shelter and see how many declawed cats have lost their homes for litterbox avoidance and aggression caused by the pain of those stumps. Note I said non kill shelters, in kill shelters declawed cats are routinely put to death immediately as unrehomeable because they no longer trust human beings and who can blame them? Declawing is despicable and it's people like you who are responsible for the millions of cats living in misery with sore stumps and claw regrowth. Owning a cat is a privilege not a right and if a person can't cope with a clawed cat then they have no business taking one into their home.

Heidi	5	0	I am against the practice, however outlawing it, I can't agree. I've clipped cats claws for years and trained all my cats to avoid the furniture. However, my Mom's pet was declawed at the advice of our Vet. This cat would scratched his face and nick his eye. I sucessfully healed four very bad eye ulcers. So bad the vet didn't expect us to get them healed. Before he injured his one of his eye's to the point of it being removed, the vet recommend we declaw him.

NI	3	0	Yes, declawing should be banned. And the vets should report declawed animals just like physicians have to report suspected cases of child abuse or battered women. For those who are worried about their furniture, they do not deserve to have a pet. This law should be easy to implement because adopting a pet should come with the strict condition they will not be declawed and an agreement signed to the effect which goes into the animal's health records. And for those inhumane pet owners who want to declaw their animals, try pulling out your own nails first.	17009494	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Paige LoVoi	10	0	I believe that declawing cats is animal abuse. Claws are a cats first line of defense and without their claws they are defenseless. I wish they would make this illegal everywhere. It is selfish for owners to do this. I have two cats who came to me already declawed and I worry that if I did not take them in they would be stray outside cats and probably would not survive. Also one of my cats loves sitting outside in the flower pot and would love to be outside more to explore and fully experience cat behaviors if she had her claws. It is also incredibly painful for the animal and even today just touching my declawed cats front paws makes her wince. If furniture is such a priority maybe you shouldn't have pets or keep them in a different area of your home. Declawing cats fingernails in my mind is equal to removing our feet and hands. If we didn't have our feet or hands we would be defenseless.	17007050	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should It Be Illegal to Declaw Your Cat?

Judy	3	0	Declawing is a horrible procedure. The cat is in excrutiating pain after afterwards and it is completely unnecessary.

Eric Craig	3	0	Ridiculous. Myriad can have a patent on the techniques used to sequence a gene, a patent on the test used to detect the gene, but they cannot patent the gene itself. It's the equivalent of Newton patenting F=MA - it's a fact of the natural world that mankind has discovered, not something new mankind has created.	9182291	Fri Jun 07 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Can the Human Blueprint Have Owners?

Robbie J.	9	0	"According to Adam Mossoff: ""But Myriad's patents don't cover genes in their naturally occurring, unisolated form, just as the aspirin patent did not cover chewable bark. Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context."" But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new ""compositions of matter""' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings?"	9178967	Fri Jun 07 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Can the Human Blueprint Have Owners?

fatmart	11	0	"Mossoff is being quite disingenuous. He keeps talking about ""identifying, isolating and purifying something."" At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about ""identifying, isolating and purifying something,"" that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything."	9177340	Fri Jun 07 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Can the Human Blueprint Have Owners?

Casual Observer	4	0	Every thing found in nature got to be by some kind of mutation and even engineered genes are now found in nature. The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.	9182493	Fri Jun 07 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Can the Human Blueprint Have Owners?

Should I be allowed to patent the molecular formula for water? Should everyone who uses water after that point or does research on water have to pay me a nickel? See how absurd that sounds?

Emile	10	0	"As Horace put it, ""You may drive out Nature with a pitchfork, yet she still will hurry back."" Genes, whether isolated or not, and whether ruled by the Supreme Court to be covered by patent protection or not, will forever remain part of the natural world, not the conventional world (the world we humans construct). No law can overrule nature in this way. While corporations clearly have a case for patenting manipulated (constructed) genes, it goes against the deepest common sense to rule they can patent ""isolated genes"" that already exist in nature merely because they ""found"" them. This is no different from arguing that a naturalist who spends millions of dollars hunting down bats, and then finally stumbles upon a bat deep in a cave in a jungle, should be able to patent that bat. Patenting particular genes is a perfect example of scientific and legal hubris."	9178797	Fri Jun 07 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Can the Human Blueprint Have Owners?

Peggy	9	0	Conventional agriculture in the Midwest allows its fertilizers to wash into the neighboring streams. Conventional animal husbandry pollutes the Mississippi with manure. This waste of nitrogen and phosphorous has caused a loss of oxygen in a vast area of the Gulf of Mexico, killing off all the fish and the fishing industry in that dead zone. Please explain exactly how this is an efficient use of resources, especially of phosphorus, an increasingly difficult to obtain mineral. Organic farming strengthens the soil with compost, reducing runoff, and unites the animal and herbal branches. Finally, the reckless use of antibiotics, purely to promote growth, has been proven to foster antibiotic resistant bacteria. The impunity and political power of the farm lobby is displayed in the refusal to tally the quantity of any particular drug bought by a farm to the FDA. Many people will die of disease thanks to these farmers.	7094497	Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Organic Food Worth the Expense?

Dan Green	5	0	The Stanford study revealed many issues. Having read newspaper articles about it ,brought me to the conclusion like many issues we pursue with herd mentality, Organic products may have just been a good marketing scheme. I kind of compare it to Drug manufacture advertising, after FDA approval, as if we all of a sudden we have a simple solution to complex problems. Drugs like organic produce, usually turn out to be questionable. Both cattle and humans are full of Antibiotics, problem is we consume meat from cattle. If feed lots don't protect cattle from disease they would cost us more as many would be sick and bring less profit when butchered. Point is Organic food is all about making money. Few people have the space or time to grow anything. We delegate those duties to corporate farming so it shows up nicely packaged at the supermarket with a label few can understand.

""We found crop yields to be 20% lower in the organic systems, although input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53% and pesticide input by 97%. Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs."" With the reduction in energy and pesticides they seem pretty efficient to me. All organic practices are not equal. Organic systems that ""stack"" crops like growing mushrooms beneath orchards or ducks and fish being raised along side rice patties are way more ""efficient"" than conventional. Science does prove organics are healthier and safer. The irony of that recent Stanford paper is that it showed there are less antibiotic resistant bacteria on organic meat and less pesticide residue on produce. Produce grown in biologically active soil, which is achieved using organic soil building methods, does have more testable ultra-trace minerals. Scientists are only now understanding how important these minerals are to human health.

Jarvis	1	0	While the government wants us to eat healthy, it is very true that organic foods are outrageously priced for the small amount of food we recieve. Yes, when going to McDonald's and getting 5 things off of the dollar menu you get more bang for your buck. However, that is one reason why America is in such bad shape literally and figuratively. Obviously organic products are healthier for you than genetically enhanced ones. The cows that produce the normal milk we drink are fed steroids to be able to produce more milk than naturally possible. Therefore, we are not consuming 100% pure milk. That can cut down the natural nutrients we would be recieving if everyone housed their own cow. So, this article couldn't be any more incorrect by saying that America is worse off consuming organic products. If everyone decided to trade out a bag of Lay's for some all natural vegetable chips, consumption sizes would be cut down and health could be improved.	7192051	Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Organic Food Worth the Expense?

It's an opportunity, albeit a huge spectacle, to remind us that we're all on the same planet, where we can compete on the field with sport, not war. Brazil is one of my favorite countries, with a rich culture and a special joie de vivre not found in many other places. It's unfortunate and sad that their political problems have brought the situation to where it is now....but, political corruption is not really anything new, and not limited to Brazil. I've lived for years in dangerous mosquito zones (zika, chikunguniya, dengue, malaria) and stayed healthy by taking preventative measures. Olympic goers need to be educated about how best to prevent mosquito bites, the place needs to be sprayed, and an easy test people should be readily available for people returning home.

My beef with him, is how he insists that the games be played in sewer water, so long as he does not have to swim in there himself.

Lorenzo	5	0	Brazil's political and economic problems are no reason to postpone or cancel the games. While the non-political ideal of the Games has never actually existed, canceling the games at this late stage would only make things more political. And as for conditions on the ground, most of the (very real) damage that Dr. Williamson points out has already been done. The Zika virus is another story. It's too early to confidently predict the course of the epidemic. In a couple of months, it may be a lot better, with public health officials finding good ways to protect travelers (and their communities back home who they might then infect). Or it may be a lot worse. If a scientific consensus emerges that the Games are likely to be a public health disaster (and the jury is still out), then the 2016 Games will need to be postponed, or canceled outright.	18546949	Mon May 16 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Brazil Postpone the Olympics?

oz7com	1	0	Home school is good thing. I've had great success in the classroom at the college level with home school students. Sports is not academics. There seems to be some value in permitting home school students to play sports from the social development perspective. As far as competition is concerned. A more appropriate mix of academics and competition is interscholastic speech competition (forensics and debate) and chess. These activities mix competition and academics much better. In fact, I believe funding for the above activities should be equal to sports. They also serve title nine objectives and should be counted as interscholastic competition activity, just like sports in competitive activity with some thinking taking place.	5474672	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

M.E.	7	0	Nick, homeschooled kids are part of society. They just don't go to public school, same as private school kids. In my state, the state athletic organization that oversees high school sports created guidelines for homeschooler participation in high school sports. They must meet academic and other requirements that enrolled kids must meet, but as long as they do, they are eligible. The overseeing organization realized that excluding homeschoolers was indeed discriminatory, and set about creating a system within which they could participate. In other states, there are laws on the books that require schools to allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities. My daughter was very involved in sports, and very talented at it, and she took advantage of both elite leagues and her high school teams (she was an enrolled student, not a homeschooler). The elite leagues are available to those who can make the teams, true, and most serious athletes participate in them. It's the lack of programs for the average kid after the age of 14 that's a problem. Also, even those who can make the elite teams can't always afford the fees.	5477405	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

Nelle	16	0	The parents have chosen not to have their children attend public school, which the law allows. Having rejected the education at public schools, they now want to participate in a part of the systems which is superfluous to that educational purpose. They may pay taxes like everyone else, but the school does not receive state funding for their kids, but will have to expend very limited extracurricular funds on non-students. If they are allowed to participate, the family should pay for the privilege. Clearly these folks believe in having your cake and eating it too.	5476620	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

The students may not attend the school but as stated in the article above they pay all their school taxes. Also just as said above about Tim Tebow becoming the starting quarterback for a professional NFL team, so why cant you allow others to venture out and reach for their goals in various sports. Some home-schooled teens are very good at sports they just need the chance to show it.

NS	3	0	They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp. Bottom line: form a home schooled league and have fun and make up your own rules.	5510177	Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

Library Lady	15	0	My daughter would LOVE to be able to opt in and out of classes at the Virginia public high school she attends. Personally, I would LOVE to be able to pull her out of certain classes and get her tutored in them or some such. But that's now how it works. If her high school is not good enough for these kids to attend, then they have no business being there playing sports. It is not a cafeteria, you don't get to pick and choose what you do and do take off the tray. Why don't we just take team sports out of the schools and make them a separate institution? Certainly a lot of the folks who are gung ho on their local high school football and basketball programs don't give much of a damn about the academics of those students anyway so long as they can have a winning team. Let's set up something elsewhere and let the rest of our kids concentrate on getting an education that will enable them to do something besides playing sports!	5477994	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

tuts	9	0	Why would a kid who attends a public school and plays for one of its teams want to, or have to, give up a spot on the roster, or even their position, to a kid who doesn't attend their school? Why would a team of kids who may have played together, hung out together, studied together, taken the school bus together, eaten lunch together, for a number of years want to welcome a kid who they may only see at practice onto their team? Why shouldn't a talented kid who goes to a school with particularly weak athletic program and/or facilities be able to join a team from a school in another part of the city or county that has a great athletic program and/or facilities? Should public schools be allowed to set up a draft for home-schooled free agent athletes? And so on.	5477096	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

julieunplugged	7	0	Yes, Steve. That's just how it works. My kids have been part time enrolled students at the local high school. They've taken chemistry and French, theater and music. They've been in marching band, color guard, acting, and chess teams as homeschooled kids. Homeschooling means the parents determine what educational tools best serve the interests of their kids. Savvy school districts happily include home educated kids when they can facilitate that education. It's worked wonderfully for us, in West Chester Ohio.	5476726	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

maytloo	5	0	"I can't agree with this policy. School teams should be represented by the students who attend that school. Part of the school experience is the right to try out for various teams-and not just sports. With home-schooled children, because they're not attending that school, they're really not representing the school body. And there are plenty of quality public schools out there that ARE NOT 'sub-standard, crime infested, corrupt, morally bankrupt, leftist indoctrination camps."""	5474754	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

Peter	8	0	This idea is absurd. If a child's parents choose to home school him or her, that seems a clear choice to remove one's family from the life of the school, including its extracurricular programs. How about the home-schooled students play on teams of home-schooled students? Or perhaps individuals could compete in solo sports against other home-schooled individuals. Their parents could make the effort to create their own league, or have their children participate in community-based or private recreational or competitive leagues. The taxpayer argument does not hold water. People without children-as well as commercial property owners who live outside the district where their business is located-must pay local property taxes without receiving the benefits of sending their own children to that school. Moreover, as far as I know, most schools' indoor facilities (libraries, gyms, pools, and so on) are not open for the general use of taxpayers who live within the boundaries of particular school systems. Outdoor tracks are probably the exception.	5474728	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

LMC	6	0	I was home-schooled, and so I sympathize with the plight of home-schoolers without adequate athletic competition. However there are at least two strong arguments against home-schoolers' inclusion (and against the tax payer argument) that none of the debaters brought up: 1) Private school families also pay taxes and yet may not try out for public school teams 2) Public schools only get funds based upon enrollment. Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken? I suppose the only reason it's even considered is the opportunity for competitive advantage to the school. If they were demanding inclusion in art class, I doubt it would be on the table.	5480877	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

CL	12	0	It does not matter that parents who home school may pay just as much into the school system as other families. People without children pay as well and don't think this authorizes them to use the library or recreational facilities. In addition, supporting a school is not just about paying taxes. Parents who home school because they don't think public schools are good enough for their offspring weaken the very fabric of the public school system and should not seek to benefit from it. If it's not good enough for English and Math, it's not good enough for sports. (Of course, this should not apply to children who are home schooled because of special needs.)	5474645	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

Janet	3	0	There are layers upon layers of sports organizations that accommodate home schooled kids - high school varsity should not be one of them. These kids have the opportunity to compete athletically in local recreation leagues, travel teams, AAU teams, and elite regional teams. High school sports should be about building athletic excellence and also about developing a sense of pride and comraderie in a placef that's that's truly the center of their existence for 4 short years. After all, should we then allow kids in private schools, boarding schools, or local religious schools to compete for varsity spots in their local public school?

wcovenant	9	0	The main reason educators argue against home schooling is because it works. It works so well, they have designed the system to work against the parents who chooses to become a primary educator to their own children. The legislators' should embrace the parent's decision and remove legislative road blocks that would hinder and disrespect a parent's unique role in their children's lives. I believe this is called progress in the right direction. One way to overcome this obstacle with sports would be a standardized test that would allow public and homeschooled students to participate in all extra curriculum activities without any bias or discriminatory practices. As it is now, home schooled students are being discriminated against.	5477940	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

P. Andrukat	3	0	In previous times the Virginia High School League did not let black high school students play sports. It is interesting that it took 16 years after Brown vs. the Board of Education to integrate schools.

Obviously the Republican led virginia government didn't get the memo. Stay out of peoples lives and keep government to a minimum. This is also a faux tax issue. Really good citizens there VA homeschool parents. Let my child play sports or enroll in school activities or I won't pay my taxes. Here's another thought: You didn't want your children to go what you describe as inferior schools with inferior education so you decided to home school them but now you want them to bond with the inferior kids who have been in the schools for years?

MB	7	0	Homeschoolers, by and large, are Christian conservatives who don't want their kids learning about godless things like global warming, evolution, and multiculturalism, and don't want their good kids corrupted by bad kids--in essence, they want to individualize education, and limit social contact with people not of their persuasion. Even if the latter is not a primary motivation, it is incident to the former. Great. Now, I thought (at least, this is what I was taught in my very conservative Christian household) that sometimes, you have to sacrifice what you want so you can be a good Christian. Like school sports, for example. And it is only ONE example. Why can't these people recognize their decision to home-school for what it is? People do not get to opt out of society without consequences!	5479139	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

Elizabeth	12	0	How about children who live in the district but attend private schools? Should they be allowed to play? What if their private school doesn't have a football team, or they don't make the team? Presumably their parents pay taxes; should they get to try out for the public school team? Home-schooled children do NOT attend the school. It is a school team. They should not participate. Should home-schooled children get to participate in the spelling bee, robotics club, science olympiad? in Michigan, public schools receive a certain amount of money for each child who enrolls, not a lump sum based on how many parents pay taxes. These schools should not have to use their budgets to pay for opportunities for children who are not enrolled and, therefore, do not bring dollars to pay for their education or other opportunities the school provides.	5477663	Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Home-Schoolers Play for High School Teams?

Mary Setterholm	2	0	"To JeffB Well, Rachel raised great questions that got attention - great. This is what this debate is about. I am quoting you: ""Controlling prostitution at the level of the prostitute is like controlling drugs at the level of the junkie."" This statement (on the GRE or LSAT) would not pass a stress test on logic, regardless of sides, as there is a missing correlation - business of prostitution similar to business of drug trafficking (missing piece). Great focus on demand! So, we get help for the junkie, indeed. All addicts need help for the addiction, including the sex junkie. So, do we legalize prostitution so the level of sex addiction that will always be with us becomes abundantly clear? No - because the consumption of women, as flesh and blood drug, is a form of cannibalism.

And women should have places to go too. Plus since it is expensive there should be clubs that allow sex play short of intercourse and a variety of options for members to mingle. There should be options to minister to the intimacy needy. There should be surrogates for teenagers and perhaps learner permits with sexual education. There should be confidential assistance for teenagers sexual issues, acceptable expression of parphilias and ways to explore without having actual sex. Much violence, abuse, substance abuse, breakup problems and stalking comes from limited options that produce fixations. We have to consider developing love and caring based systems rather than war based systems throughout our society.	6038604	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

Adam	5	0	I strongly disagree with the author's characterization of prostitution, but strongly agree with the author's suggestion of what to do about it. Prostitutes are most certainly allowed to say no to unwanted sex. It is only because the current system within which prostitution operates has so disempowered prostitutes -- leaving them vulnerable to both their clients, their employers, and the law -- that their wishes are so easily disregarded. If the prostitution laws were reversed so that it is the johns and the pimps, not the prostitutes, who commit the crime, then prostitutes would have much greater power to avoid unwanted sexual contact and violence, and perhaps a much better chance of getting out of the business altogether.	6039608	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

I also question the realism of your argument. AFAIK, prostitution seems to be a major sector of every known human society, in societys with strict penaltys (even death) and in societys where it is legal Isn't crimminlization like prohibition - something doomed to failure, as banning prostitution is like banning alcohol, or other drugs, perhaps desirable, but doomed to fail because it goes against human nature ?

Michael	6	0	Prohibition? It all boils down to our society's Calvinist attitudes toward the sex act. Period. Legalizing (and even unionizing) prostitution is a no-brainer. Safer for both worker and client, legal prostitution serves a common good. Like prohibition of alcohol, making prostitution illegal merely drives it underground and fosters the criminal element that causes the danger, the trafficking, the potential enslavement.	6036091	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

Mary Setterholm	11	0	The premise that 'all of us take money for the use of our bodies' would put bodies on a plane of an object - the statement was oddly dehumanizing. Then we go from 'bodies' to prostitution - a business - many businesses sell objects and should be free to do so. So, from your argument, it is the business, which uses bodies as commodities/objects, that should be free of stigmatization? Legalizing prostitution codifies the dehumanization of women, continues the War on Women, and should not be hideously reframed as emancipation.	6036332	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

Matt Nadler	1	0	We've seen how a wild west approach with no laws works - abused children and adults get exploited. At least with a legal system there are some checks and balances to protect the workers, satisfy demand, and ensure a safe work environment for adults. With a legal path, there's an incentive to play by the rules. Those who continue to operate outside of the laws - the traffickers and child abusers - have less cover from the laws and those who enforce them.	6039095	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

sukev	6	0	Legalizing prostitution and cracking down on trafficking are not mutually exclusive. The increased traffic in Amsterdam comes from the fact that it is just one such city and attracts men from all over. If prostitution was legal in every country in Europe this would not happen.

But until we get rid of it, legalization does, in theory, offer protections that doesn't currently exist.	6037743	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

amanda	6	0	Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).	6037518	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

Steve	13	0	"""Numerous studies show that between 70 percent and 90 percent of children and women who end up in commercial sex were sexually abused prior to entry."" The author seems to imply that if there were no sex workers, all of these people would not have suffered abuse. The problem of abuse came before the activity of prostitution. Abuse leads to prostitution, not the other way around. Banning prostitution will do nothing to prevent abuse, and abuse is the real problem, not commercial sex. I see no valid argument that legalizing prostitution would prevent prior abuse of women and children. It could be bettered argued that if there were legal outlets for sexual urges, cases of abuse would decline."	6036521	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

Peter Cohen	10	0	Legalising prostitution is only the beginning of a long process of emancipation. Succesful emancipation can not develop without legal acces to legally regulated prostitution; but very important is a process of cultural acceptance. As long as prostitution is looked down upon, full emancipation will remain impossible. But breaking down the illegality of prostituion is a vital pre -condition. I know the legalisation effects (of prostitution) in the Netherlands rather well, and believe me, after legalisation the complex problems related to low social status of the profession are not over. Legal regulation is, as I said, only a beginning.	6035405	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?	Can legalized prostitution ever be safe and free of exploitation?

Cami Parker	3	0	I work at the Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Nevada. Nobody lives on site... Those that live locally (as opposed to those that fly in from all over the country) go home at night. Those that fly in can go or do whatever they choose after their shift is over, just like any other job. We can also refuse a client for any reason or no reason at all as well as being able tosee our own prices for any activity and change them on a whim. If there should ever be any problems (which is extrodinarilly rare because, as you mebtioned, the clients know better) response by the law is very fast. I also am university educated and have every opportunity in the world. I chose my line of work of my own free will and I love it.

Nancy	11	0	Those against the legalization of prostitution point to exploitation by employers like the legal brothels in Nevada, as if exploitation of workers is something unique to sex work. As commenter RC pointed out - many workplaces are abusive. There will always be employers who exploit workers no matter what kind of work. You don't respond to exploitation by making the work illegal. It's right up there with people who can't tell the difference between sex slavery and sex work. Sex slavery is horrible - not because it's sex but because it's slavery. But many people, including well-meaning people can't make the distinction because anything to do with sex just throws them into a riot of emotion and they can't calmly and dispassionately distinguish between non-exploitive freely chosen sex-work and exploitation and slavery. And anybody who tries to do look at the issue rationally is branded as naive at best and cold-hearted and colluding with sex traffickers at worst.	6038129	Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Is Prostitution Safer When It's Legal?

WJH	3	0	It strikes me that the problem is not one of architecture but of the ways in which economics drives and is used to drive development. The only thing any contemporary city knows to do is to give economic incentives to build structures that maximize tax revenues, primarily real estate taxes. Supposedly the increased revenues will be distributed as economic and social benefits. But this model has run its course. New York, for example, turning into an outlandishly expensive and impervious island of wealth. As service providers, both blue and white collar, are driven further and further from the center they find it necessary to commute inward by automobile. Automobiles are resisted by the wealthy center as ugly noisy dispensers of pollution and pedestrian risk. Even the NY public transit system is quite unable to overcome the need for commuting by personal vehicle. This is clearly pushing to unsustainability. What needs to be worked out is a mode of increasing revenue that does not prejudice development.	12411475	Tue Jul 29 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Are 'Starchitects' Ruining Cities?

sor perdida	1	0	The unacknowledged advantage of privileging 'starchitects'' over the local talents is that the first come with a set of standards, a rigorous vocabulary and a name that prevail over the compromises usually inherent in a developer-driven culture (cost cuts, value-engineering, the client's 'taste', etc. - whatever could damage a project from the design phase to the actual built outcome). If one looks objectively, disregarding personal taste, whether it is a Gehry, a Nouvel or Isozaki building here in New York - they all stand out as impeccably executed architecture. Most of them relate to their context (see the formal empathy between the Beekman Tower and Woolworth Building, for instance), or creating a new one where such context is either weak or lacks character. It is a welcomed fad that reinstates the lost 'edge' New York once had, and subliminally educates both the developers' taste and the local crop of professional talents. Why should we be afraid of that?...	12418818	Tue Jul 29 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Are 'Starchitects' Ruining Cities?

LE	6	0	"Mainstream architecture in general is the problem, along with its ugly alliance with real estate capital. Real estate just wants cheap and big. Architects provide it in self-interested happiness, deluding themselves that the only way to build is with curtain walls, skins, ribbons, pilotis, anti-contextual nihilism, and other bits of the painfully idiotic dogma of the modernist movement (which alas is not dead although it ought to be). Even nuttier is that the architecture profession is obsessed with an out-dated Hegelian notion of trying to produce ""an architecture of our time"", a goal that if examined is utter nonsense and hubristic posturing. Meanwhile our load bearing masonry city barely survives the attacks this alliance has produced.

Eddie	2	0	We are living in an era of individuals where ego trumps everything. Today we glorify money and fame, and we allow individuals to glorify themselves and their clients, not the average pedestrian who must increasingly suffer unfriendly streets with wall-like façades protecting the elites inside, or forbidding store fronts keeping the riff raff out of luxury stores and creating bleak streets once business is over. I'm a liberal and not elitist and I am a fan of modernism and some of the modern facades. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I bet, in one hundred years or so, we will rue the day we destroyed livability and proportion and replace these monstrosities with user friendly edifices similar to the ones which were destroyed to make way for the monstrosities.	12422071	Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Are 'Starchitects' Ruining Cities?

M. Chase	5	0	As a former network and radio communications specialist for the U.S. Army and a small network administrator, I believe that I can say with confidence that I agree, eliminating librarians so that they can be replaced by technology is a gross diseconomy. First, the school board must be forgetting about the fixed costs of maintaining a library. Second, there is a complete neglect for the fact checking costs. Third, current technology costs are prohibitive; the school board's enthusiasm about the power of technology, though understandable, is misplaced. Then, there are the children themselves to be considered. What level of confidence will these children be able to have in the integrity of their resource material without a person to person interaction that will be able to uncover the specific focus and the nature of the child's, or the adolescent's, inquiry. That alone should be reason enough to reconsider.	4062443	Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?	States and cities are under severe budget constraints.

JES	46	0	Having worked at a college library its readily apparent Information Literacy should not be taken for granted and its fairly evident that kids going to into college haven't had enough contact with their school librarians already. There is a strange misapprehension that information is truly just a Google away and students are turning in papers based on Wikipedia entries alone. It will be a very sorry mistake to continue to view librarians as dispensable when they are so desperately needed to navigate the information explosion. As we have more and different types of tsunamis of information, we need more technologically advanced librarians to get us through it. I would also point out that as information is digitized, it falls into the hands of fewer and fewer brokers in a position to control it. The usually forgotten role of the librarian is as a bulwark against that flow of information being in some way hampered or repressed.	4062089	Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?

Calvert Cliffs	30	0	The reason school administrators are reviewing library budgets in light of new technology is because they themselves are mostly confused about new technology-and all too few of them have ever had much insight into what librarians do in schools. Too many school administrators, and subject teachers too, think of the library as the baby sitting department. Meanwhile, the librarians-who are usually the only professionals in the school with notable training in research methods-go along quietly, educating students about how to tell a source from a delusion. The web has made that need more acute, not less. Good quality school administrators know that, but they are few and far between.	4062079	Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?

In contrast librarians have a tremendous base of knowledge that guides not just students but the teachers within a school. Beyond the love books and knowledge librarians empower students to go beyond google, they help students learn differentiate and validate information in the sea of misinformation that characterizes the internet today. Yes teachers and schools can stumble on without a librarian, but it is as if we would ask a child to each McDonalds for a meal everyday.

She was at my 50th high school reunion two years ago, no longer able to see, alas, but still the lively, alert, aware person she was years ago. It seems to me that this isn't a question of ebooks replacing paper books as one commenter seems to imply. Nor is it a question of whether or not ""internet access"" is the same thing, as another comment states. Reading an ebook is a skill, and a different skill from reading a paper book. Using the internet efficiently and critically is also a learned skill. Google and Wikipedia are not the beginning and end. These skills need teaching--skilled teaching. Librarians have the skills to do this, and they have the heart and mission to do this, and they have the love of patrons of the library to do this. So let's not suggest that a visit ""once a month or so"" is the equivalent of a human being available down the hall daily."	4063639	Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?

JTM	8	0	"I have worked as a school librarian for over ten years so of course I don't think librarians are expendable but, it is not just personal. Librarians teach among other things, finding and evaluating information. This skill is of tantamount importance. It is needed throughout life. It's a skill that is used for everything from deciding what movie to see to deciding where to buy your next home. Classroom teachers have less and less time to teach anything that is not evaluated on a standardized test. This is what No Child Left Behind has wrought. Lawmakers and administrators are very short-sighted if they think that eliminating school librarians will have little impact on their students. As Samuel Johnson stated ""Knowledge is of two kinds.

Most school librarians are already certified teachers, so this would not be a difficult transition. Librarians are involved in classroom instruction, but usually in the classroom of another teacher.

Alix Woznick	7	0	As a school librarian who enjoys working with our local public library system, I think there is a lot to be said for looking at ways for the two to work together more closely to best serve our students, not as a cost-saving measure. Can we deliver better service and aid student achievement by joining up more effectively? But while there is overlap in the goals of public and school libraries, they have a different focus in their staffing and services. In addition, as teachers are asked to do more and more, a school librarian is able to support THEIR training needs and those of students to provide instruction and resources that match their curricular needs. The school librarian provides a fantastic value, reaching every single child and staff member in a school - every program, teacher, administrator, and students of every background and ability are served. Talk about bang for your buck!	4060841	Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?	States and cities are under severe budget constraints.

SL	1	0	It seems that many of the comments in this thread are from educators who are in the classroom, face to face with students every day, as am I. My experience teaching students to use the Internet and do efficient, objective research runs the gamut from those who easily learn techniques for evaluating and validating information to those who can be convinced that President Lincoln was actually a female based on a ridiculous edited photo and a headline on a tabloid from the grocery store! My advice to politicians, policy makers, and pundits is to spend a few days in a school, in Mr. Wurman's case with certified Library Media Specialist, and see what is really going on. The problem with schools today is not the teachers, it is the decision makers who think they know what is good for students because they once went to school.	4070387	Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?

tizzielish	1	0	This comment is a bit dumb in its limited focus. The guy says kids don't need to be taught how to search the internet, as if everything that is available in a library, esp. a research library, can be found on an internet search engine. Not true. There are all kinds of databases with densely packed data that require expertise to access. Helping students find their way through increasingly modern archives of value treasure troves of data is what librarians do. Maybe fifth graders don't all need to do high level research but we need some humans prepared to do serious, in-depth research in the human future. Doesn't that effort begin in school? It is mindboggling me that this 'expert', a high-tech exec in Silicon Valley (as if that means he knows anything about research) who actually participated on a board that established CA educational standards. It's scary to have such a lame-brained mind in such a position of power over educational standards for CA children. I have a doctorate and sometimes I need a librarian to help me find answers to questions. That's what librarians are for. And kids need them more than I do.	4065687	Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?	States and cities are under severe budget constraints.

Nancy Anthony	3	0	"I have to agree with Wurman to the extent that ""If we are to have any hope of meaningfully increasing the literacy of our students, the solution must lie with classroom teachers and not with libraries and librarians."" What he neglects to include, however, is how important the school librarian can be in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources and skills to work with students in improving literacy. Keeping abreast of literature and new technologies that will meet the needs of the wide range of learning styles and abilities within one school is a yeoman's job. To expect the classroom teacher to be that expert without support is once again expecting too much from teachers, leading to many leaving the profession. A school librarian, if the right one is hired, can be the school leader in information resource management and use."	4062498	Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?

Manny	7	0	When every document ever written has been digitized and available without charge on the internet, then one may argue that libraries with physical books are not needed. Old, even ancient, literature is just as important for research as recent literature. During my PhD research in chemistry in the 1950s I had to refer to work from the 1850s. My university did not have these in their library because they were so old. The research institute where I ended up working most of my career would not have had this work because the originators thought that only work produced after 1925 was relevant. (Someone convinced them otherwise.) There you have the gamut of poor thinking about libraries.	4060847	Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are School Librarians Expendable?

casual observer	6	0	One of the most crucial reasons that education from K-12 in this country is so bad are activists and aspiring politicians who run for School Boards and prevent people who have the interest and learning to keep the schools funded and educating students well from serving on the Boards. These people are out to attract attention to their pet projects, gripes, transformative visions, and general ego promoting activities which will help them advance and to excel. They basically keep the students in their districts from gaining the educations which they need to excel. Being an activist is a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's ego and just making the dull and banal the focus of one's efforts.	17502873	Tue Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2016	Can Activists Be Politicians?

casual observer	3	0	Activists run for elected office and are elected frequently, and they advocate for their causes just like every politician advocates for something. They usually accomplish their purposes and sometimes what they introduce actually remains after they leave office. As public servants they tend to be focused upon their core constituents and their core issues and tend to trivialize the concerns which do not relate to them. They really feel that the day to day concerns of people who they formally represent but really do not wish to bother worrying about do not matter or can be ignored as they follow their passions. One of the reasons that so many people feel alienated by politicians is the way local politicians are preoccupied with causes and special interests.	17502811	Tue Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2016	Can Activists Be Politicians?

On another note, the transit worker should not have been fired. It was a private, non-violent act, and if it gave him peace of mind let him have it. Muslims should even urge the transit authority to reinstate him.

Reader	3	0	The Government has no business controlling its workers' free speech on religoius matters during off-hoursand to attempt to do so amounts to goverment endorsement of which religious practices are acceptable. This is easily demonstrable -- as follows: A person is an adherent to a new religion. This religion believes that the holy books of three large monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have been corrupted, have errors and therefore must be cleansed. The required cleansing is done by fire. Each Sabbath, adherents must burn one page of each of the holy books for these faiths. It is a bona-fide belief helf by adherents to this faith. If the government prevents them from conducting their cleansing ceremony because others are offended, then it is clearly taking sides on what does and does not constitute acceptable religous beliefs and practices.	2564576	Mon Sep 20 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Can Speech Be Limited for Public Workers?

A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination.

Muslims need to learn that Islam is just another religion with no greater status or legal protection than any other religion. If they don't like it they should move to repressive countries in the Middle East that live, work and think about 1000 years behind the West. They're free to leave. They are not free to impinge on Americans' right and liberties. Unlike other countries, the US must never consider freedom of speech a negotiable right, protected for some and not others.	2566312	Mon Sep 20 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Can Speech Be Limited for Public Workers?

EC	1	0	What the NJ Transit employee failed to understand is that there is a distinction between free speech rights (burning a Koran, a flag or what have you) and the fact that employment in America is, by and large, at-will -- you can get fired if your boss doesn't like the color of your socks. If his off-hours -- but very public and very controversial -- actions were deemed to affect his workplace efficiency, then his employer had a perfect right to fire him. Sadly, this particular individual has learned, in the harshest way possible, a rule of Free Speech that many tend to forget in our times: just because you have the right to say whatever you want it doesn't mean that it's always a smart idea to do so.	2566181	Mon Sep 20 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Can Speech Be Limited for Public Workers?

willow	2	0	I am against burning books, but being born with the Jester's gene makes me want to poke pomposity in the caboose. Also, when people get upset and afraid of things that can't really hurt them (like riding in an elevator) it is good for them to face their fears and see that nothing terrible happens. So what if one were to burn a Kindle that contained a copy of every religion's special literature? That way, maybe, we could all see that these relics are not where God's love lies; and destroy an insidious device in the bargain.	2565780	Mon Sep 20 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Can Speech Be Limited for Public Workers?

Brian	6	0	One thing that nobody seems to be asking, and that no source seems to have made available (quite possibly because nobody knows) is what Mr. Fenton was wearing. Regardless of being off-duty, if he was clearly identifying himself as a Transit employee he's very likely still subject to the Transit code of conduct. Most New York firefighters wear NYFD t-shirts when off duty, at least some of the time. the same goes for New York police and NYPD t-shirts. If Mr. Fenton was doing the same, there's a strong case that he's acting as a representative of the NJ Transit Authority rather than a private citizen. Keep in mind two things folks. First, if he'd burned a Christian Bible lynch mobs would be forming. Second, the only protection this idiot has from being fired is that he works for a government office. Any private employer could fire him for the act without hesitation.	2565452	Mon Sep 20 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Can Speech Be Limited for Public Workers?

Matt	55	0	Sadly, at some point this is about a different sent of rules for Muslims. Burn an American flag, ok, rip up a photo of the Pope, ok, this is America. But deface a Koran and you are called out as an intolerant bigot. This is wrong on the face of it. And at the root is Islam's own intolerance. Strongly criticize their religion and they want to not just protest, but kill you. We need to stand up to this bullying. To the specific issue in this case, yes, fire the worker, if you also fire a worker who burns an America flag during an anti-war rally. Of course we know this wouldn't happen.	2565381	Mon Sep 20 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Can Speech Be Limited for Public Workers?

sdavidc9	2	0	As long as jobs are scarce, it makes sense that people who have not been convicted should have a better shot at them. This means that the burden of the scarcity of jobs should fall more heavily on the convicted, even though this makes it more difficult for them to go straight and have successful lives. On the other hand, those with criminal records and experience are more likely to return to crime if they cant find legal sources of income like jobs, and those with no criminal experience are less likely. From this point of view, it makes sense to give the oil to the squeaky hinges, thereby rewarding lawbreaking and penalizing those who have not gotten caught breaking the law. This is our present policy, which we wind up with because it is supposedly cheaper in the short run. People unlikely to make trouble because they cannot find jobs are left to their own devices.	18200299	Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should a Jail Record Be an Employer's First Impression?

James	13	0	On our farm I frequently employ inmates from the county jail. A couple of thoughts here, ... according to my prospective jailed employees, in every case the judge has gotten it wrong and they are not guilty. They typically are satisfactory employees until they finish their sentence and then their attendance becomes erratic and they eventually fall off of the wagon, and head back to their drugs and criminal friends. On average they lack any sort of personal motivation to improve themselves. It is a sad deal. We are all in this together with these folks. I really don't know what we can do about this dead weight in society.

Nancy	7	0	I have personal experience in this matter. My son started using drugs when he was in his teens. He got into trouble with the law and served time in prison. When he started to get his life back together he found himself unable to find a job because of his record. This had a devastating effect on his life. He worked in the underground economy which is a sure ticket to trouble. He got off drugs, married and had a son. But he relapsed and lost what little he had gained. Flash forward to the present: last September he was found dead in his apartment of an overdoes of heroin and fentanyl. He had been plagued by depression and self-medicated. Although he had hundred's of friends, and was considered a great person, he couldn't fight the demons alone. He is not blameless but the laws of our land that punished without any hope of rehabilitation certain conspired to keep him down.	18197888	Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should a Jail Record Be an Employer's First Impression?

Fear may be at the bottom of this pattern of behavior but in my view it only makes things worse in the long run.	18199552	Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should a Jail Record Be an Employer's First Impression?

Peter Bournias	4	0	Maybe its time to let Greece permanently host the Olympics as they wanted to do anyway. Having worked on the Athens 2004 project, the real problem with regards to tourists visiting the city that were not interested in the Olympics was for a short period of about 20 days. So, the idea that it creates havoc is really not true. The worse aspect about the Olympics is the cost factor for any country. Even those held in the USA were done so at a loss. Politicians love to boast that the country will make tons of money but it is never the case. In the case of Greece, it was a major excuse that along with corrupt politicians brought financial ruin to the country. So if a country is not interested in the status quo of showing off and exploiting its taxpayers, Greece could be made the cenral point of Olympic Games once and for all.

We can barely handle the tidal waves of tourists -- it's becoming more and more difficult for we natives to enjoy our own city in the summer. I don't want even to think of what the Olympic games would do to us. I have a suggestion: Antarctica. An international place, lots of room for new construction. Just think what it would do for their economy and tourism. And what about the moon? Just think what that would do for all those poor NASA employees who are now being thrown out of work. But sarcasm aside, perhaps it's time to give up the idea that everybody should get a chance to host. Might it not be better for the IOC to pour its considerable resources into a permanent venue, with all participating countries contributing to its maintenance? But not NYC, please.

college senior	2	0	If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir.	5360372	Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Parents Control What Kids Learn at School?

Liberals want their way of thinking taught, conservatives want theirs. There has to be some way for schools to deal with this other than bowing down to the pressure of the most vocal parents.	5355496	Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Parents Control What Kids Learn at School?

Just A Guy	42	0	"I have in, my career, hired two home schooled kids (the ultimate in ""parent choice"" education). On paper both looked good, and they seemed to know their stuff in the interviews. But both were extremely difficult for other staff to work with, because they were ultimately incapable of seeing other people's viewpoints. One of them literally threw crying hissy fits when she didn't get her way. Now New Hampshire is allowing this kind of head in the sand ""la-la-la, not listening, you're view doesn't exist"" kind of behavior in the public schools? Remind me to avoid their job applicants. I don't have time to deal with employees who think they have a right to their own facts. Bottom line: you are welcome to give your child a narrow, even bizarre, education if you choose.

Patricia	35	0	Conservatives make me laugh when they struggle to keep their kids from learning evolution. What they're going to end up doing is keeping their children from having careers in science. Since I'm a liberal, that doesn't sound too bad to me. It keeps the competition down. People who don't accept evolution don't belong in science anyways. The more you cut out of your child's curriculum, the bigger the educational and career advantages you're handing to those kids whose parents aren't as nearly controlling and obsessive and ideologically blinkered as you are. So there is a free market solution to this problem. Maybe the Cato Institute should study that angle before they issue their next statement on the topic.	5350429	Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Parents Control What Kids Learn at School?

The Cato Institute is funded by people who wish to denigrate and weaken government at every level. If they pay McCluskey's salary, it is because he is carrying their water. Parents who are not content with what their children may or may not be taught in public classrooms have always been free to home school or enroll them in private schools. Public education has been a smashing success story for America and tens of millions of its citizens. However, allowing individual parents to alter lesson plans at will can only result in chaos and a less-educated population. This New Hampshire experiment will end in failure.	5350361	Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Parents Control What Kids Learn at School?

They aren't illiterate because the school system is broken, they are lazy, pampered, and spoiled--at home. Do they really expect a teacher to create a different lesson for kids because the parents don't like the content? When are they going to do this, before or after they create lessons for all of the special ed kids that that the law says must be ""mainstreamed"" into classes that are over their heads? When they are creating science lessons that must incorporate math, reading, arts, and practical living? What are the other students going to do while the teacher is teaching all of this alternative material? I WISH more parents had a clue what was going on in the school, but they need to work with the system, not against it. Like the author, if my parent didn't want me to hear, see, or do what what was going on in class, I left the room, went to the library, etc. We need to get over claiming our ""rights"" and pay attention to what is really important to society."	5359976	Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Parents Control What Kids Learn at School?

Ralph Deeds	2	0	My comprehensive high school sex education course was one of the most valuable to me of all my subjects. My high school classmates and I were the guinea pigs for the pilot program at LSU's University Lab School in 1953. The course was quite comprehensive. It covered the mechanics, contraception, VD, prostitution, deviant sexual behavior. I don't recall the word abstinence being used. However, the teacher, J.Q. Long, emphasized that sex should be more than a physical act with potentially serious consequences, physical and psychological, and was not to be undertaken casually. Twenty-five years later I was amazed when some parents in my children's school in Michigan objected to the sex education courses which I'm pretty sure were less comprehensive than mine thirty years before in Louisiana.	5358904	Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Parents Control What Kids Learn at School?

Teaching children about atoms is misleading because atoms are made up of so many even smaller particles. Insist that kids be allowed to write and sing songs about leptons and quarks and draw pictures of neutrinos. Go nuts. Insist that children be taught that because Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same day, they must have been the same person! Also, that when they read ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" they must refer to it as ""Uncle [the T word]'s Cabin,"" because some words are just too hurtful. This is just a starter list.

MG	1	0	I'd just like to see the curriculum. Too many times, the syllabus for any given course is behavior focused with no mention of the topic material to be covered. I also have to agree with one of the commentators below. Language Arts and similar classes are not academically challenging for good readers because of the need to accommodate those who struggle. I don't object to helping those who struggle but I would certainly let my child opt out of classes where he/she does not learn anything new. I'd also opt out of the character education training, which too often, requires students to respect everyone's opinion.	5357545	Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Parents Control What Kids Learn at School?

Brenda Morales	7	0	What will these students do in life when they don't have the ability to opt out of something they disagree with? One of the important lessons learned in schools is that we are different, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. We are setting our children up to be unable to adapt to change. Speaking as a teacher, we are also making teaching an even less appealing profession. We already have to accodomate and modify based on IEPs and languages, and mandated testing. What other profession gets so much input from those outside the profession? Do people go to their doctors and tell them how to treat their problems? Give advice to their lawyers or accountants? Teachers are professionals and should be treated as such. Many of us have masters degrees and just want to work with kids, to help them learn and grow. We are impeded in that by so many factors, and this law is another one.	5356425	Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should Parents Control What Kids Learn at School?

Oakbranch	17	0	I would go even further. Making all beaches public, and requiring public access to all beaches WITHOUT the beach-goer having to pay a fee to get to the beach. FOr instance, the NOrthern California coast is spectacular, north of San Francisco. I find it offensive to come to a place like Sea Ranch, and find that all the pullouts along highway 1 in this area, from where one can walk to the beach, require you to pay a fee to park. So, unless you are traveling the highway without a car, there is no way to access the beach at Sea Ranch without paying a fee. THis should be forbidden. In my view, we should also prevent people from being able to buy land within a certain distance of the water in areas that remain undeveloped, in order to better preserve these undeveloped areas.	12101063	Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Beachfront Access	Should those with beachfront homes have to open their land to the public?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/22/should-beach-privatization-be-allowed	Beachfront homes should have to open their land to the public	Beachfront homes should not have to open their land to the public	false	false	Beachfront homes should have to open their land to the public

This would be impossible without the publicly funded Corp of Engineers and other public agencies that control river levels through dams and regulations.

If they refuse to allow access to the beach, and the local police departments ticket & tow cars parked on the street owned by out of towners using the beach, then the government should exercise eminent domain, kick the owners to the curb and raze the houses.

They are compensated in the form of aid whenever a hurricane destroys their beach houses. Seems to me a small price to pay to allow people to walk on the beach behind your house. (I would, however, understand if beachfront owners pushed for strict rules concerning the use of those beaches: curfews, open container rules, and that sort of thing). . Me, I'll avoid the whole problem when I buy a weekend house for my family. We'll buy on a lake instead of on the ocean. No beach to worry about, and no hurricanes....	12100570	Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Beachfront Access	Should those with beachfront homes have to open their land to the public?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/22/should-beach-privatization-be-allowed	Beachfront homes should have to open their land to the public	Beachfront homes should not have to open their land to the public	false	false	Beachfront homes should have to open their land to the public

cbg	9	0	What exactly is the point of preserving the pristine character of beautiful beaches if the only people who can afford to enjoy them are the uberwealthy people who own them? The value of such scarce natural resources is so high that it really shouldn't be affordable for any one person to own them. Because, once a beach leaves the public domain and becomes the private property of one person, the benefits of that beach are the right of that person to enjoy (and charge others for or restrict others from) in perpetuity. In my opinion, beaches all over the country should be declared public property	12103852	Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Beachfront Access	Should those with beachfront homes have to open their land to the public?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/22/should-beach-privatization-be-allowed	Beachfront homes should have to open their land to the public	Beachfront homes should not have to open their land to the public	false	false	Beachfront homes should have to open their land to the public

YoDaveG	18	0	Allowing maximum access does not cause maximum use. It distributes use over a broader set of beaches, actually reducing crowding. Further, people don't change rental-car oil because that is the contractual responsibility of the rental company. It is not akin to a commons. The shore is a commons and the public has both the right to enjoy it and he responsibility to protect it.	12099562	Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Beachfront Access	Should those with beachfront homes have to open their land to the public?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/22/should-beach-privatization-be-allowed	Beachfront homes should have to open their land to the public	Beachfront homes should not have to open their land to the public	true	false	Beachfront homes should have to open their land to the public

Elizabeth T.	1	0	I grew up in Malibu and my family still lives there. I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is public access with no public facilities - ie. restrooms and trashcans. I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement.

johnf	1	0	Maine and several other eastern states define private ownership out the mean low tide level. Water covered zones are open to fishing, fowling, and water-borne navigation, but not recreation.

All recovery of private property because of natural disaster be nullified. My tax dollars pay for these folks to recover loses due to their choice to build in obviously unstable environments. Therefore if the public may not cross their property to access the public lands; the Federal government should not be obligated to insure and/or pay for their loses.

biggy	36	0	Not being from New York, maybe this discussion isn't meant for me, but I have to weigh in. I grew up in the country, on a farm, with a man for a father. He taught me to be like him: wake up early, work hard, eat a good meal, go to bed, repeat. He taught me that it is the responsibility of the strong to stand up for the weak, to do the right thing because it's right and not because someone is watching, to treat everyone with respect even if you loath them. He taught me how to shoot a gun, how to hunt, and the responsibilities that each of those carry with them. He raised me to be better than him, because that is the mark of a good man: leaving things better than you found them. So, to me, if a man does all of these things, he's a manly man even when he's getting a manny peddy. (don't know if I spelled that right because I've never had one.)	6619277	Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Modern Men Manly Enough?

It's not how he looks but how he treats me that really matters.

In other words ... he has a code.	6616203	Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Modern Men Manly Enough?	Are men spending too much time at the spa and the gym in lieu of grittier, manlier pursuits?

Eli	1	0	The notion of manhood traits aroses from primal times when manhood connoted the ability to ensure the survival of oneself and then of family and community. So manhood became associated with the warrior, the hunters, the frontiersman, the guard and the provider. Woman complemented primarily by being the homemaker, while her man was out in the wild or at war. But ancient threats and dangers are gone, society is relatively safe and women are quite capable of providing for themselves, thank you. But modern threats have taken new forms but the underlying gnawing inner emotions of fear, insecurity, doubt, hopelessness etc still exist. So the new role of a man is to inspire faith where there is fear, courage where there is doubt, hope in despair and love in the midst of hate. all this talk of rough edged muscles, sweatiness instead of perfume, ability to light fires and chop wood are nothing more than sexual fantasies and turn ons - which of course is still necessary for good relationships and survival of the species.	6622253	Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Modern Men Manly Enough?

Girls mature faster than boys, as a result they excel in school earlier and beat out men to college. females are the most protected class in society and recieve most of the attention.Boys are ignored more and left to fend for themselves, so yes a whole generation of females more mature than men has arisen.Immature men do not have a fully evolved masculine identity.

As a low-maintenance type of gal, the sort who can get ready for an evening out in under 20 minutes (and that includes the shower), I would not be able to tolerate a guy who had 'manny-pedis' and facials.

I've been married 15 years now to a handsome guy who is clean but doesn't primp or spend time worrying about grey hair or wrinkles.

Sparky	14	0	this is so sexist! Smelling clean, keeping fit, and looking put together does not make a man feminine any more than having back hair, showering once a week, or beating his wife would make him more masculine. I am NOT equating domestic abuse with having back hair by any means. But I am trying to show that gender stereotypes are stupid. There is nothing masculine or feminine about grooming your body hair or wanting to look good. If a unibrow is bothering a man and all it takes to fix it is a $20/20 minute trip to the salon, then whats the problem? I also don't appreciate how a lot of these things that are popular with gay men get labeled as feminine when applied to straight men. Perhaps in the past gay men have had more liberty to deviate from gender stereotypes and as a result straight men have felt more at ease to do the same. I really don't think that there is any justification for the kind of reactionary view that some of the opinions expressed here.	6620440	Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Modern Men Manly Enough?

Mike	6	0	The red meat and potato men are probably like my overweight, high blood pressure father, dead of a heart attack at 56. Call me crazy, but as I enter my mid 40s, I prefer to eat more vegetables, lean meat and fish, and go to the gym (or otherwise exercise), I have the feeling a lot of my peers, who also lost their fathers at what today seems like a young age, are doing the same so they can still be around when their sons reach their mid 40s instead of just being a person from history to their grandchildren talked about now and then.	6618700	Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Modern Men Manly Enough?

To wish for the man of yesterday is myopic - times have changed and the having the costume of a man does not equal being more responsible and courageous.

A Guy	4	0	"It has nothing to do with nutrition education. Nowadays, we have this magical thing called the internet. There are no excuses for not knowing what's healthy and what isn't. You're either too lazy to figure it out for yourself (and so you let the food companies tell you what to eat -- nice conflict of interest right there), or you simply don't care. I also like how you mention ridiculous ""documented"" results yet fail to provide said documents. A ""50% reduction in the incidence of children becoming overweight."" You can deduce that just by changing drinks in a vending machine? Please tell what analysis was performed to come to that fitting conclusion -- as a statistician, I'd love to know.

Edmund Dantes	3	0	What bunk. The worst dietary info we've gotten has been from the USDA! There's a very simple cure for the obesity epidemic. Stop subsidizing food. Americans spend far, far less of the income on food than those in other nations. End the farm subsidies. End the food stamp subsidies. Stop interfering with market mechanisms. The price of food will rise, as it should, and the obesity epidemic will slowly become a memory.

Bravo David	24	0	"It's really not enough to say ""we need more information"". Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book ""Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It"" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on ""heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled"" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition ""experts"" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place."	6003260	Mon Apr 16 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Do We Need More Advice About Eating Well?

Mom didn't take the time to educate the kids, girls and boys alike, on how to cook and the schools have done away with Home Economics classes for science and math classes thinking this will better America. Over the last 40 years the ease of outside food access into the home outweighs the time of cooking in the home and getting everyone fed and into bed for the night.

My son gained weight when he left home, but when he lost 50 lbs with the help of a diet sold by a national franchiser, he realised that the amount of food that he was served at home (and complained about) was a normal portion size. Now he is much more thoughtful about what food he orders, even from the fast food chains. Try searching on the term ""portion distortion' and look at the 2 powerpoint presentations from the NIH.

Matt	5	0	It's actualy a global issue, in the UK, we're increasingly heading down this obesity path, despite similar popular trends for buying fresh/loca/organic, etc. I don't think there's an easy solution, I think it involves policy effort across a number of areas (unfortunately), including education, food regulation (labelling, salt content, etc), and possibly that dreaded word:..tax Taxing those food products that, like cigarettes and alcohol, are vices and placing a collective burden on our national healthcare systems. I speak as a smoker, drinker and occasional lover of fast food, just aware that clearly the current situation is taking society as a whole down a very unhealthy path.

To lose weight is a lifetime goal. All one needs is motivation and to realize that if you lose your X pounds, you have accomplished very little. One must change your eating behahiors permentally. And, don't forget the importance of exercise. If you have one or more dinners counter to your new eating behavior, don't use that as an excuse for going back to one's 'bad old ways.' Expect it and just realizee that it happened... And immediatly resume your healthy eating pattern. So, you like creamy cheese cake, chocolate, a rare prime sirloin steak...

Marilyn	10	0	One way Americans can change their diets is to do it ONE small step at a time. For example, I decided to drink green tea in the morning, instead of a coffee latte. Later, I decided to substitute iced water for soft drinks. Another change was whole wheat thin buns for sandwiches, instead of regular bread. Instead of yogurt with lots of calories and sugar, I now eat plain, non-fat Greek yogurt mixed with fresh fruits like blueberries or bananas. Each change was painless and over the years the weight melted away, until I reached a BMI number of 22. I think I would have been discouraged if I had tried to make all the changes in my diet at once. It would have seemed too hard.	6002312	Mon Apr 16 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Do We Need More Advice About Eating Well?	Maybe Americans would be healthier if we understood nutrition better.

casual observer	2	0	The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.	15976967	Thu Sep 03 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Immigration Really a Problem?

Robert	19	0	First, Marco seems quite bitter at the country that took him him, provided him scholarships, helped him succeed. I would be kissing the ground in thanks that I escaped to a decent place. This is often a common reaction from people who rely on the largesse of others. The Pew Hispanic Research poll a few years ago asked Mexicans if they would immigrate if they could. Fifty percent said they would. That would be sixty million people. That is just Mexico. The U.S., Canada, and Switzerland generally lead in the polls as to where people would live, if they could. Governments have the responsibility to protect their borders. Due to the desirability of the U.S., the U.S. government has a particular responsibility. From what I can tell, for the most part, people are welcoming of immigrants. They want a process where the appropriate background checks can be done, and the number can be controlled. People do not like it when others jump the line at the movie theatre or on the freeway. They do not like it in the immigration arena either.	15992159	Fri Sep 04 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Immigration Really a Problem?

Best case scenario for the followers of Trump, and for the majority of conservative Republicans, is to ship as many hispanics out of this country, so that the Republican white majority party can maintain its political power for the foreseeable future. What nonsense to suggest that a human being can make a life for themselves somewhere for many years. And then someone says, you didn't follow the rules in the beginning -- so out of fairness let's destroy the decades of hard work, dedication, and yes, disregard the taxes that you paid while you were here.

Gary	7	0	This situation has existed for decades. The Illegal immigrants have provided needed labor in many areas of our country. They for the most part are industrious, hardworking, friendly and religious people. Stopping the flow of illegal immigrants could have happened decades ago by making it a crime punishable by fine or jail for anyone to hire an undocumented, illegal immigrant. For decades despite all of the talk, our government has given a nod and a wink for them to come here. They have raised their families here and have been a net positive to our society. WHAT SHOULLD BE ILLEGAL IS OUR GOVERNMENT USING AND ABUSING THESE PEOPLE, THEN BEATING THEM OVER THE HEAD SAYING THEY SHOULD BE DEPORTED ENMASS. Shame on the Republican party. Where is their conscious? What are their religious beliefS???????	15976524	Thu Sep 03 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Immigration Really a Problem?

oh	10	0	I think the issue that we ought to be able to agree on, is that birth right citizenship has to end. The motivation for immigration can vary, but poverty and lack of opportunity in the country of origin seems like its often a cause. And international policies that worsen prospects for a better life would have to be seen as a contributing factor as well. Yet, openly rewarding illegal immigrants with automatic birthright citizenship is incentivizing the disregard of the host country's own laws. This continuing conversation over immigration going on in the US, mirrors that going on in Europe today. It's the same issue. Do we fix the world first, and hope the desperation driving illegal immigration abates over time? Or absorb those flows of people from those troubled regions seeking a better life now? I think its better, and more fair to all concerned, to have a managed process for documented labor, visitation and immigration, than a mad lawless rush across borders. Civilization and civilized behavior breaks down in the face of desperation. Accepting unlimited immigrants from around the world would not improve the lives of those left behind. Who is responsible for helping them?	15975417	Thu Sep 03 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Immigration Really a Problem?

Make all unskilled and semi-skilled work in this country restricted to members of unions under contract with any and all employers who hire employees for that kind of work. This would assure that only those documented could work and no employers could escape paying decent wages and the safe working conditions by who they hire, anymore.

MrLoaf	5	0	"What a silly line of reasoning. We have to stop thinking about immigrants as people who simply take our stuff, as if there were a finite supply of ""jobs"" piled up in a warehouse somewhere, the distribution of which is a zero-sum exercise. Immigrants are people and people are assets; they bring their creativity, energy, and culture to America for everyone's benefit. If that needs to be stated in terms one can measure with a dollar value, think of immigrants as sources of customer demand, stimulating employment. Immigrant-run restaurants and shops are a perfect example. Would native-born Americans be working at Chinese restaurants or Mexican bakeries if not for immigration? No, because those businesses wouldn't exist in the first place, and we'd all be worse off as a result. If those who call for America to exclude immigrants get their wish, the immigrants will benefit some other country, at which point these same pundits will predictably get their pants in a twist because ""Country X is beating us"" in education, employment, creativity, etc."	15996265	Sat Sep 05 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Immigration Really a Problem?

Chazak	3	0	Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also.	15981217	Thu Sep 03 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Immigration Really a Problem?

The unemployment rate for African-Americans has been double the overall rate for many decades. It is and has been an outrage. But where is the evidence that it has anything to do with immigration? Jobs for Americans and adequately funded schools for Philadelphians are big problems, but what do they have to do with immigration. Rather all of these issues have to do with the outsourcing of American jobs by multinational companies and by the strangehold the anti-tax party has in our state legislatures and Congress.	15975680	Thu Sep 03 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Immigration Really a Problem?

Burden on social welfare system due to citizens who can not find jobs at acceptable wage levels. 4. Decreased tax collection. 3. No TB screening. 4. No background screening. 5. Discourages wait in line legal immigration. 6. Self selected only. Needs of country not considered. The recent case a a women being shot dead would have been preventable had our immigration laws been followed. Le'ts return to the rule of law with immigration.

Denis Pombriant	11	0	Now would be a good time to begin instituting a serious conservation program to obviate the need for whatever oil might be found off shore in the Atlantic. What's so good about more oil? It is polluting the planet to a dangerous degree, we lust for it to the extent of going to war for it. Our modern civilization runs on machines that run on it. But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet. The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options.

What issues are important to people who know that oceanography, ecology and climate science are fact based and that industrial scale accidents at sea are almost inevitable? It's clear that fossil fuel exploitation in already damaged fishery and recreational zones poses great risks.

The Chesapeake, the Delaware Bay, the Outer Banks, the shores and harbors all along the east coast coated in toxic crude.

Tim McCoy	2	0	If 1941's liberals thought the way any number of liberals and leftists think today: December 8th, 1941. FDR stands before Congress, asking for a declaration of war against Japan. The ships in Pearl Harbor still spewing smoke. But a huge delegation of liberal democrats from the President's own party stand and denounce their own President. Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns.	16962419	Tue Dec 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Americans' Fears Legitimate?

Doug Karo	2	0	The banks made deliberate decisions that they correctly believed would increase their profits immensely if nothing blew up on them and would increase their profits moderately if they were caught and had to pay modest fines. No matter what they did, the banks and their management would make out like successful bandits while others would suffer. Reforms have not appeared to change the dynamics because the reforms that are politically feasible to the vast majority of the legislators taking contributions from the banks are ones that are acceptable to the banks. I expect until there is personal responsibility by the bank management all the incentives are toward risky behavior. Under these conditions, I don't see how a bank that didn't engage in risky behavior could compete. Nationalizing banks would make it clearer than ever that the banks were too big to fail (and could engage in even more risky behavior on more profitable terms than their competitors who lacked the too big to fail guarantee).	10949342	Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Are Big Banks Out of Control?

This process is broken because excess world capacity in labor and off shore productivity is sopping up all of the spending and the banks are putting their investment in risk fee bonds. Why not a nationalized bank that pays a premium, over any commercial bank, to long term (retirement) depositors, who are U.S. citizens (not corporations), that is solely dedicated to funding U.S. infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, dams, housing)? This plan encourages saving by U.S. citizens (the kind that breath), retains jobs and spending on U.S. soil, and the increased productive enhancement realized by such projects remain in the U.S..	10945708	Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Are Big Banks Out of Control?

Meredith	17	0	How to start re regulating? What's the difference between this now, where the govt itself seems to have no power over the banks, despite public opinion, and the banking S&L crisis when hundreds were prosecuted and jailed? Clinton started the deregulation of banks in the 90s. Lobbying and campaign donations have hugely increased, esp since the 2010 court decision. How can the govt untangle itself from the corporate hold on its powers? It's as if the govt is really regulated by the banks and corporations, rather than the govt regulating the banks. And all in the name of 'free speech' and free private enterprise. And in this bad economy with huge unemployment, the banks threaten more joblessness and recession if they are not left to do as they please. Where's the rebuttal in our main media? The majority of the public is anti big bank and want to break them up. The democracy isn't working.	10944255	Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Are Big Banks Out of Control?

Garak	3	0	Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial system recently, they no longer pose any such threat. That is illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly.	10945584	Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Are Big Banks Out of Control?

GED	5	0	The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else!

Robert Goldschmidt	11	0	It should be clear by now that, given enough slack in their leash, the banks will take the path of highest leverage without concern for risk. Look at how they all copied Countrywide Financial so they could get a larger share of feed at the trough. Of course this will always end with the US taxpayer baling them out and financing hideously large bonuses to those that risked everyone else's money and lost. We desperately need the Glass Steagall wall between deposits and investments. It would also be a big help if we implement a method to lower income inequality so that unsustainable amounts of personal debt are required to prop up our economy. Remember when Chairman Greenspan testified on TV in a Senate hearing and urged existing homeowners to tap into their equity? The rapid rise in personal debt in the form of credit card debt, mortgages and student loans is feeding these to-big-to fail financial behemoths that throw their weight around Washington.	10944652	Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Are Big Banks Out of Control?

irvrube	1	0	I would imagine Mr Bove would have said many of the same things about Lehman Brothers in early September 2008. Sometimes too big is also too dangerous despite profitability. There's way too much control not only of the economy but of the politics when banks get as powerful as the two he references. Furthermore, I suspect that if those giant banks were broken up, smaller more local/regional banks would hire every one of those employed by JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, etc. Not only that, but their economies of scale actually reduce the total potential employees mini-banks would need to operate. And those mini-banks would be beholden to their communities such that they'd more likely be rigorous in compliance with regulations.	10951533	Tue Jan 14 00:00:00 CET 2014	Are Big Banks Out of Control?

northlander	6	0	Bove ignores a major factor in largeness, the direction of capital away from productive investment and into speculation. The justification of profitability as a sole measure is a basic one for consolidating banks, but with that consolidation comes direction of capital away from production and into speculative instruments. Irresponsibility came from engineering returns rather than earning them. Failure came from a quantitative analysis of investment options that valued high investment risk over productive risk.In a smaller institution this would have simply constituted fraud. In these behemoths it constitutes lingering catastrophe. We still have not freed capital from these casino operators. We who supply them with deposits and tax buffers are denied a flow of funds in interest or investment than support or employ. Flush them into a banking system that buys us jobs, not chips.	10946928	Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Are Big Banks Out of Control?

Susannah	6	0	I disagree, the answer is no. Investors are gamblers. Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression. And I am not even going to mention the power that large banks have over the election of politicians who have sold their souls to big business that ships jobs overseas or produces items that cause injury to entire societies or the environmentally questionable activities that abound simply to make a fast buck.	10944936	Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 CET 2014	Are Big Banks Out of Control?

Old lawyer	22	0	Obamacare is a second-rate plan. These writers are imminently correct in stating that a single-payer plan is far and away the better system. Leaving the private insurance companies in the loop and paying them 20% off the top was a gross mistake. They are in it for the money, nothing else. A single-payer plan would remove the profit motive and provide better and cheaper coverage. The private companies have no motive to hold down costs since their part of the pot is assured.	10095324	Fri Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is Obamacare Working?	The law is starting to take effect.

Joe Smith	1	0	Anyone who thinks the GOP will become a productive partner with improving the ACA has their head buried in the sand. The GOP had 2 years to provide positive input before the ACA was voted into law, and 3 years since to work in unison for strengthening it. The GOP has done nothing but oppose it, not one thing aside from their perpetual insane negativity. Anyone who thinks the GOP will magically decide to advocate for improving health care if the ACA is delayed, is a just as crazy as the GOP. They want to make medicare a voucher program, outlaw medical malpractice lawsuits, and enable shysters selling substandard insurance in one state to scam consumers across the nation. This has been (and is) the GOP's only suggestions (aside from privatizing the Veterans Administration healthcare program) . They also want to bundle other items into the healthcare debate such as privatizing social security, eliminating the EPA, building the Keystone Pipeline, outlawing abortions, and doing away with public sector unions. Lets move ahead with the ACA, and let the GOP continue blundering around in their corrupt stupidity.	10105265	Mon Sep 30 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is Obamacare Working?	The law is starting to take effect.

Michael S	6	0	The low rates quoted by the Administration don't include total cost, which in the case of the lowest cost policies include high deductibles and co-pays. The other shell game is that delivering many young and healthy new insureds will offset the cost to the insurance companies of no pre-existing condition restrictions. With high premiums many young people will ignore the law or choose to pay the alternative tax. Insurance companies will not lose money; if enough young people don't sign up premiums will rise or companies will stop participating.	10100991	Sat Sep 28 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is Obamacare Working?

Look Ahead	3	0	"Glad Ms Grace is no longer associated with the Medicaid Commission. But as her credentials for this debate include ""free market ideas for health care reform"", its interesting that she doesn't offer any. Must be one of those ""social welfare"" groups organized to attract tax deductible funds for GOP causes. The Manhattan study focuses only on premiums and not total HC cost. Since the actuarial value is increasing from 45% today to 80% (% of premiums paid in claims) in the individual market, its going to be a better deal by definition. Mr. Roy forgot to mention that. The young male premiums before subsidy go up so much because they are offsetting higher premiums traditionally paid by women in the ""free market"" because they have babies, even though it usually takes two. And younger people are paying more to reduce the age penalty as they get older, much like we do for Medicare. So what's a young high income male without insurance to do (not many of these, BTW) to reduce their premiums? They can buy catastrophic coverage for a small amount to cover major expenses, just as before."	10098566	Fri Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is Obamacare Working?	The law is starting to take effect.

But I never see anything viable coming from the modern Right, just some mealy-mouthed phrases that camouflage their intent to do nothing at all. And why should we?

These obligations pale in comparision with,( like all citizens do),the benefits, advantages and rights I enjoy at the same time. In fact, what I want is a far less complicated, straight-forward, far more liberal and universally applicable health care system that is at least comparable to what are obtaining presently in France,UK and Scandinavia.I don't mind the personal costs,no one should, I believe.It is the basic minimum that any nation should render to its citizens.And it could prove to be quite cheaper than whatever provided by any insurance company and far more efficient, if wisely administered. Anyway, I personally believe, ofcourse buttressed by my own calculations and ratified by my intellectual friends, that the rich are indeed the free loaders in any society, extracting far higher benefits from it than what they themselves contribute.But they make the maximum noise and grossly distort the reality for denying the middle class and the poor what they richly deserve-- through rational logic and by canons of progressive civilizations.	10098012	Fri Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is Obamacare Working?

It has created thousands of private sector, high paying jobs just in the field of technology alone. I am on Medicare and have seen dramatic changes for the better when my health providers went to an team based process of treatment supported by an integrated hi tech, online system of treatment. I have full access to my Docs online cutting down on office visits, I have a lead Doc who coordinates and communicates with the many specialists I see so tests, lab work, prescriptions are never duplicated but instead shared. I as well as all my Docs have access to all my records in real time and all kinds of current resources and research that help me to be a more informed advocate for my own health in partnership with my Docs.

Sequel	7	0	The status quo ante prior to Obamacare was that healthcare was a complete perversion of the free market and open competition. This country allowed insurance companies to corner the market on healthcare via insurance, to price medical treatment beyond the range of any individual to pay without insurance, and therefore to deny care and coverage to anyone with impunity. Obama has restored the balance by taking away the insurance companies' ability to block consumers from receiving medical care. He did it without the social violence that, by rights, should have accompanied such a revolutionary change. Obama actually initiated a return of healthcare to a free market, competitive status. But it required an acknowledgement that basic healthcare is a right that cannot be abridged.	10095919	Fri Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is Obamacare Working?	The law is starting to take effect.

Mary	4	0	It seems clear from reading the comments that the vaccine debate is falsely represented. While there are those who absolutely refuse any vaccinations, they are clearly in the minority. In fact, the vast majority of those who question the childhood vaccine schedule are looking most closely at a few of them, specifically Varicella, Flu, Hepatitis B and to some extent MMR. Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good. You don't need a medical degree to think critically about your family's health and to demand answers from vaccine manufacturers who are, frankly, not forthcoming with information.	11448878	Sun Mar 30 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children

Dodo	2	0	It is quite sad to see a doctor advocate for government coercion for something that every doctor acknowledges has its risks. How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines.	11417696	Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children

There is further the danger of causing the disease to be far more severe as the natural immunity of the population disappears ( check what measles did in the South Pacific) And then there is the compromised immune systems due to the injected toxins under the guise of adjuvants You are told that vaccines don't cause SIDS and autism etc etd Well listed as side effects on the vaccine inserts!

christina	2	0	the fact of the matter is it is our decision as parents to make the decision we feel best suits our children. if one chooses to vaccinate, that is their choice and i respect that they've made the difficult decision to protect their family by vaccinating. my choice however is to not vaccinate our children, as i feel i would be doing more harm to them than good. it's not an easy answer whichever you choose, but i am proud to be born in a country that allows me the freedom to make decisions regarding this. we as parents have researched the options fully, and are aware of both sides risks...and choose the lesser of the 2 evils for us.	11411383	Tue Mar 25 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children

mary barter	9	0	My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision.	11410249	Tue Mar 25 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

MF	18	0	Forget about religious exemptions, how about scientific ones? Why are newborns getting a Hepatitis B vaccine right out of the womb? There is zero reason for this unless the mother has Hep B. Yet every US child is to get this on day 0? And then 2 more? What on earth for? Bombarding a newborn's immune system with so many assaults so early is ridiculous and imo criminal. Why are more than 80% of the outbreaks occurring in vaccinated children? Is the vaccine even effective then? Aluminum (a neurotoxin) is added to many vaccines to purposefully inflame the immune system to react to the virus (called an adjuvent) and yet aluminum is highly inflammatory and toxic to the brain. This is madness. Why is infant mortality under 5 years the worst in the US, which gives 35 vaccines (!) and best in Iceland and Japan where they give just 11? A study in NZ found that unvaccinated children were far more healthy (far less asthma, excema, ADD) than vaccinated children.

Sonya Snyder	10	0	No Thank you. I do not EVER, want my government to force me to inject my children with anything. Many vaccines and eye drops for that matter, contain the carcinogen Mercury, which in later years can present as rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoma-like symptomology. And, people still today get polio from live but weakened polio virus vaccines... This has to remain individual choice. My child was allergic to Pertussis vaccine, but homeopathy protected my children much more than any vaccines could.

Richard	20	0	There should be no exeptions from vaccinations with the exception of valid medical exemptions i.e. an individual with a serious allergy to the vaccine for example an egg alergy in the case of the flu vaccine. Asside from that demonstratable allergy no exemptions for either personal belief or religion should be entertained. If I had my way vaccinations would be a part of a single payer national health system providing universal care. The private sector has proved itself to be incompetent to provide modern health care and need to step asside.	11408115	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

Tijger	14	0	If parents want choice then they also should be willing to opt out of society as a whole, its society thats threathened by their actions because of the reduction of herd immunity and the consequences can be severe for others. Given that the above is nigh impossible in a reasonable way the alternative is to not give parents a choice that endangers the lives of their children and others. Parents who refuse to let their children be treated for medical conditions are prosecuted for child abuse, isnt this the same thing?	11407373	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children
Cat	47	0	"Of course vaccines should be required for all children, despite whatever religious or philosophical reasons parents might have for withholding such preventative medical care from their children. Why? Because we live in a cooperative society where our actions have direct implications on the lives and wellbeing of others. Those ""withholding"" parents are no better than the selfish fools who won't get a flu shot because, ""everyone else gets them, so I don't need to."" Spanish Flu killed 20 million people, yet today's parents still have the gall to say the medical onus should be on others, not them. For all those parents out there who don't want your child immunized, try living for one year in a third- or fourth-world country where immunizations are rare (if they exist at all), and your kid is exposed to myriad diseases all but extinct in our society. You'd be terrified to let your kid play with neighborhood kids, yet here you think nothing of exposing other people's children to the same. Vaccinations should be mandatory.

Butch Burton	34	0	Vaccines are like motorcycle helmets, they protect. Some bikers say their freedom is being curtailed by having to wear a helmet. Well when a biker gets in a crash without a helmet and has serious brain damage - society will pay dearly for letting him have his freedom. Brain damaged individuals can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollar at a minimum. A drive by shooting victim can cost us over $1 million per day. The same is true for an outbreak of measels. The attempts to eliminate polio by the world continues because the costs are obvious. When in the Navy one of the officers on my ship belonged to a religious group that would not take injections. The Navy being very pragmatic discharged him with an administrative discharge - no harm done to anyone. Anyway we are part of an integrated society and public health is important to all. Public health nursing is woefully underfunded with the simple act of providing pre-natal care, a huge amount of resources and anguish can be avoided.	11404701	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children
Jason	14	0	The choice to abstain from vaccination tends to be based upon concerns about the additives and preservatives placed in the shots. I do not understand why my cat can get an additive free vaccine and my child cannot. How about demanding a change in the pharma industry to make the actual shots safer? There are known human carcinogens like formaldehyde and neurotoxins such as aluminum in many vaccines.

Just because science and history have proven that forcing my daughter to sustain herself on just a cracker and piece of lettuce each day, that doesn't mean that I should be deprived of my ability to choose the life my daughter will live so it conforms to my personal beliefs about body image. Maybe god tells me that my daughter is evil if she weighs over 100 lbs, or maybe it's my social circle that believes that a skeletal figure is healthy and beautiful.

CAMeyer	24	0	Brandeis University should be embarrassed to have given a post to someone who employs such specious reasoning. The analogy between breastfeeding and vaccination is clearly false. A mother's decision whether to breastfeed affects only her child's health. Parents' decision not to vaccinate their child affects not only that child but other children and adults. In our society, parents can perceive that any risks, however minuscule and unproven, outweigh benefits of vaccination only because other individuals have agreed to vaccinate their children and thereby reduce or eliminate risk of a communicable disease in a population.	11409111	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children
wsf	11	0	I think Americans are woefully ignorant of the power of Public Health laws here. Everyone should visit a site on Google that will explain the right of officials to remove folks with various infectious diseases from Interstate Transportation, for example. No one has control over their body in certain types of epidemics such as Ebola virus, etc. They can be quarantined against their will. If the rate of vaccination for measles, for example, got much below what our CDC thought was minimal protection for the population at large, one might expect mandatory requirements for vaccination to be stiffened. There is such a thing as a greater good in dire situations.	11408937	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

Though sincere these people know nothing about science and the scientific method and when two events occur simultaneously -- it may be the ""false cause and effect fallacy.""

Ian Maitland	20	0	I am a libertarian, but this is not a purely self-regarding choice. RC is right. This is a choice that might endanger others. If a parent's failure to allow their children to be vaccinated creates a transmission belt for an infectious disease, then the parent should be liable for the consequences of their choice. Moreover, the parent who won't let their child be vaccinated is a free rider. Other parents are accepting a minuscule -- but real risk -- of an adverse reaction to the vaccination. Their decision helps to protect the child of the free-riding parent because the vaccinated child serves as a sort of firebreak to slow the spread of the disease.	11408807	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

Ann	32	0	I see a complete idiocy surrounding rejection of vaccinations made worse by foolish false statements on the internet and in the media. And this idiocy is compounded by the paucity of early science education. Children should be taught the history of preventing disease from a very early age. The history vaccination, beginning with Jenner and smallpox vaccination, is a good place to begin. Lessons about are herd immunity necessary too. Just one person being vaccinated isn't enough. Unfortunately, I first learned about this as a very young child when I was hospitalized with polio right before the Salk vaccine began to be used. You want that for your child?	11408757	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

Hepatitis B? HPV? Be my guest--that choice only affects your family, because those are not diseases your kid can spread at school, on the bus, etc. But no one without a medical exemption should be able to opt out of vaccinations against HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, very dangerous diseases like German measles, pertussis/whooping cough, mumps (which can leave little boys permanently infertile), etc. Measles can live on surfaces like classroom desks and the metal handles people hold in buses for several hours.

Sajwert	17	0	We still haven't addressed the problem of children who come from other countries into America and have not had the advantage of early childhood vaccinations. We are seeing cases of measles, mumps, etc. increase, and this cannot be all the fault of those who have lived with and been in contact daily in this country since birth with their peers who have been vaccinated. I'm old, and when in 1st grade, I contacted German measles. NOT from someone in my class and, in fact, no one seemed to know where I contacted it. I then proceeded to infect almost all my entire class apparently. My point in telling this story is that we cannot know exactly where a child gets his contact, and therefore IMO opinion, vaccinations should be mandatory for every child entering schools from pre-K up. Until everyone - from the child who comes with their parents to America to the kiddo next door, we have to be consistent.	11404377	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

Elliot Podwill	38	0	The choice of whether to breastfeed is of little consequence to others. Not to vaccinate one's children places others at risk, particularly other children and health-compromised adults. The analogy used by the author doesn't hold up.

This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids."" Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called ""capable"" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves."	11403441	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

Celia	29	0	No, Dr. Elders, there should not be a religious exemption for vaccination against highly communicable diseases unless unvaccinated children are kept out of public school and away from contact with other children. Religious freedom is not an unqualified right, and public health must trump a parent's objections to vaccination based on religious grounds. Besides, the parents are putting the risk of disease on the child, not themselves. This is child abuse, in my opinion.	11407991	Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2014	Making Vaccination Mandatory for All Children	Should parents no longer be allowed to get religious or philosophical exemptions from having their children immunized?	/roomfordebate/2014/03/23/making-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-children	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children	Vaccination should not be mandatory for all children	false	false	Vaccination should be mandatory for all children

This not only endangers public health, but also violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in my opinion. I don't approve of any exemptions.

Stephen J	4	0	Mr. Jaffe seems to be confusing three very different situations. Parents of minor children already have the right to know what is going on with their children's care. And people who have been appointed as legal guardians (conservators of person) also have this right; naturally, that includes parents of adults who have been judged incompetent to manage their own affairs (in probate court), unless someone else (such as a spouse, adult child, lawyer, or physician) takes that responsibility. Done deal! The third case is that of an adult who suffers from a mental illness but has not been found legally incompetent. That person has exactly the same rights and responsibilities as anyone else. Of course one's doctors, lawyers, accountants, priests, and (for that matter) barbers do not communicate with our parents about one's decisions! Why should they? Mr. Jaffe seems to think that we should have a new law that would sidestep the need to establish that a person is, in fact, psychiatrically disabled. That is a dangerous road indeed.	11914230	Fri May 30 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Therapists Prevent Violence?

KBronson	7	0	All human beings are a potential threat. There are those who are honest about aggressive feelings and thoughts and those who deny and conceal. Imminent threat is a other matter. Tarasoff properly recognizes some responsibility to third parties but offers tremendous leeway to deal with that--reporting to the police is one option and usually the most ineffective and destructive. Involving family and others in the patients supportive social environment usually is far more effective and, even when done dispite objection by the patient, may preserve the therapeutic relationship. This risk is usually not confined to the moment but is at least in part characteriological and sustained. Mandating reporting to he authorities makes psychotherapists functionaries in an increasingly militarized police state. Might as well just outlaw psychotherapy outright as no real psychotherapy can occur in such an oppressive setting.	11917910	Sat May 31 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Therapists Prevent Violence?

naturegirl	2	0	These are good points, but in our current climate they remain academic. Duty to protect statutes are a first step, but they are only as good as the individuals who enforce them. It all comes down to money. Law enforcement can be trained to assess for potential harm, but that training would cost money. Therapists are increasingly underpaid and overworked due to budget cuts. Mental health agencies could launch public awareness campaigns to teach communities about warning signs, but that costs money. Add to this the fact that mental illness still carries a huge stigma, making it unlikely that young people will seek the right kind of help. College campuses are also ill-equipped or unwilling to address serious issues on their campuses. It all adds up to a ticking time bomb. As long as the mentally ill and those who treat them are marginalized, we can't expect to make much headway with regard to prevention.	11914346	Fri May 30 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Therapists Prevent Violence?

Peter	4	0	Still fail see how this would have necessarily prevented this horrific event. This would only work if the patient actually tells a mental health professional that he or she wants to harm someone (targeted individuals or in general). There's no evidence that Rodger ever communicated any such feelings to his therapists except a few minutes before he started killing. There is substantial evidence that he knowingly and willfully lied to police, withholding entirely his intent to harm. He demonstrated enough mental capacity and control to have hidden his real intent from his therapists, too. He plotted for well over a year without anyone else knowing. Unless he told his therapists in advance that he felt like shooting up a sorority house or the community, your proposed measures, even if already in place, would not have stopped it.	11913541	Fri May 30 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Therapists Prevent Violence?

Karen Hyman	10	0	I find this discussion tremendously beside the point. Some good ideas here that parents should be more in the loop and that mental health professionals should have adequate support for sharing information with law enforcement. And THEN WHAT? Presupposing that these things could be predicted, it is extraordinarily difficult to have someone involuntarily committed for psychiatric treatment and that commitment does not last long. Police can't imprison someone because their therapist or parents think they might do something dangerous. As long as we make guns easily available, we are not even trying to stop this. They have psychotic people in other countries and many fewer murders.	11913257	Fri May 30 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Therapists Prevent Violence?

ARNP	4	0	Hold on. Reporting concerns to police is not very effective if the police are not very well trained to respond. Very few police departments have the funds (or priorities) to provide special training for dealing with mentally ill/disturbed people. Too often mentally ill people are tasered, assaulted, or shot unnecessarily. And patients who are reported to law enforcement often feel, understandably, betrayed by the person who reports them, leading them to stop treatment--or at least stop being honest about their thoughts and feelings.	11912768	Fri May 30 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Therapists Prevent Violence?

w.f.murray	6	0	I think our, so called, entertainment industry is conditioning our young to more violence and radical behavior. In the case of all irrational behavior... More aggressive action must be taken when family or authorities see unusual behavior. In this case his parents recognized his problems, had concern, and notified law enforcement. The sad thing is he conned law enforcement and they took no action at all. In this case he should have been forced to seek professional help. Law enforcement does not have the experience or capability to make decisions as to mental capacity or stability.	11912503	Fri May 30 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Therapists Prevent Violence?

Tina Kubicka	6	0	As a former teacher and long-time first grade volunteer in a low income school district, I regularly use the CLEVNET system to get books for our class that compliment our curriculum or that are about subjects in which the kids express interest. We develop a reading list of the books shared each year, and let kids know they have access to them all through our local library. For communities in which books are an unaffordable luxury, libraries level the playing field, giving access to unlimited literary riches to all. In our community, they also provide much needed parenting help through story times and reading activities for caregivers and young children every week. Many families without computers at home get access to the internet at the library for homework help, employment and tax information. While libraries may be redundant for more affluent families, they provide a window into a different present and future for those of lesser means.	7957857	Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

DLo	1	0	Many decades before bookstore chains like Borders and B&N, who welcomed browsers and readers with less overt pressure to buy than to spend time, we had local libraries and their branches and bookmobiles. While specialty coffees and teas were not part of the experience, a quiet spot to read, to think, to consider without pressure either to buy or move on was what library patrons most welcomed and appreciated. Perhaps one day this invaluable resource will succumb to virtual access alone: but that presents a clear disadvantage to many people for whom the local / regional / state / national library is an experience irreplacable by any virtual counterpart. Libraries are the life-blood of our communities' intellectual growth: until we have a more equitable access to literacy, we should not be talking about the demise of library culture.	7953116	Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

The space is free, the walls are lined with books, and you can travel around the world, back in time, and to distant planets during your breaks. I once had a high school teacher who took points off of a report because I did not include pictures. I explained that the library did not allow you to cut pictures out of the magazines.

I encountered much skepticism. Then again, a benefactor saw virtue, making a sumptuous gift to launch the project. Our $19-million expansion/renovation project was completed in 2004. It was planned meticulously to meet twenty-first century needs, integrating technology and print. Eight years hence the library remains a campus focal point. Additional space has been provided for student seating as well as for technology-related projects. To my way of thinking, libraries and books remain fundamental to learning. So does technology, which I applaud and embrace. Professors who integrate these mediums are fostering learning environments for the still-new century that will enable their students to prosper in the highly competive marketplace.	7952705	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

The point of most libraries never was to serve as a storage space. Unless you are a librarian or work at a library, you probably don't realize that everything in a library, including computers, wifi, online journals, and ebooks, is there as a carefully curated collection created to meet the needs of the people who use it. What you do realize is that when you walk into a library, or go there online, you find what you need and don't need to think very much about how that happened.

Many libraries assist with literacy training, host book clubs, provide after school activities for children, give senior citizens on fixed incomes a place to borrow books they otherwise could not afford to read. Many libraries do dual duty as de facto community centers. Using the internet at home to do research is fine, Wikipedia is not a peer reviewed source that is accepted as a reference for many schools and universities. Scholarly databases that provide access to academic journals are available at libraries and are usually not affordable for most people.

We want to live in a community that respects literacy, reading and has good children's programs like story hour, etc.	7951873	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

David Naylor	4	0	Among the many services that libraries have traditionally provided, perhaps the most important are access to physical copies of published works, and access to information. As the publishing industry transforms, not surprisingly the borrowing of physical books from libraries is likely to decline. However, the need for access to information is likely to grow. This access to information is provided not only by devices and infrastructure but also is supported by the library staff who provide invaluable assistance. They assist with the tools, and serve as guides and navigators around the rapidly growing sources and forms of online information. Looking further into the future, as educational institutions become transformed by the widespread availability of free online courses, and distributed learning becomes the norm, there is another potential role for libraries as learning centers. In this case the facility not only provides the access devices, but can also host tutors and local study groups. As access to steadily growing amounts of information becomes more important for all members of society perhaps the role and services of libraries might actually increase rather than decline.	7951213	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

anny	1	0	Libraries r important in the minority neigbborhoods. When one talks abt minority, the Asian immigrant neighborhoods are NEVER included, andyet these r occupied by new immigrants whose adults work 7 days a week, leaving children to non English grant parent as care takers.Libraries serve as a save haven for knowledge and learning during weekends and holidays. Library plan reading activities and children programs to entice young readers who would otherwise stayed home, watchng the junk programs on TV. What I do not understand is why libraries would find it necessary to provide Dvds of movies to be checked out! Isn't there enough outlets around for that without wasting public money to benefit Hollywood?	7951380	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

David Michael	5	0	I love libraries! They are a great place to just hang out and be in touch with history and knowledge of the present and past. Often they offer classes and lectures and great places to study. And, sometimes the librarians are real cute as well! I use them differently today than in the past, however. I actually belong to several libraries now as a full time RVer so that I can access books on my Kindle. Yes! That most remarkable Amazon device that has allowed me to build my own library with nearly 1000 mostly free books in my Kindle Fire. At age 76, I look upon this as my personal treasury, a repositary of the wisdom of the ages. In summary, I think it's great that we have physical libraries as well as devices like the Kindle that allow us to access books from anywhere on the globe with relative ease. It's great that libraries have adapted and made changes in this computer age that benefit their surrounding communty. Bravo to libraries and librarians!	7951616	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

Bill Manson	7	0	The books, the computers, the storytimes, even the staff expertise are only elements of the emerging (or, more properly, continuing) role of the public library. The library is a community focal point and a community development agency. For decades, my colleagues in the field rode the wrong bus. Libraries and librarians sold themselves as information agents. Then we were blindsided by the development of do-it-yourself information tools. We forgot that our mandate is broader -- much broader -- than information. We are a place where people gather to connect to other people, to culture, to information, to works of art and works of the imagination. From an individual's perspective, that's enriching. From a community's perspective that's vital to the sustenance of vitality and diversity in the polity.	7951620	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

Jake Goldenflame	11	0	For the Homeless, libraries are also an increasingly important safety net: providing them with a warm place to get indoors on a cold day, newspapers, magazines and computers to let them look for a job or any other need they have, often with a means to make application for the same online. A friend of mine told me that she became homeless for a year and lived in her car. She said it was libraries that gave her a means to search and apply for the job she needed -- and won, getting off the street and into a small rented house again.	7950969	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

PogoWasRight	11	0	It will be a sad day for all of us when libraries become simply access points for the Internet. Libraries should be for books and reading, primarily, and all other activities secondarily. Plus the fact the most every library which I have ever had access to has funding problems. And libraries, like teachers and schools, are always the first to feel the cut of the budget axe. We are a strange society, and, I predict, one which is moving quickly downhill as did the old Roman Empire..........	7948878	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

ShowMe	6	0	We definitely need libraries!! It was my safe sanctuary when I was chased as a kid by bullies on my way home from school. We definitely need both printed books and Internet access, and digital books accessible from home, too. However, everyone cannot afford the digital devices so public access from the library is necessary. We would be wise to put a library within walking distance of every American, and keep the library open 24/7. The library is the most valuable resource for lifelong learning.	7950152	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

Doug Terry	4	0	There is nothing in this excellent comment with which I would want to disagree. However, I also want to add that a place with books, whether it is my house or a library, is a vital resource that brings benefits not to be found on the Internet (I am a technologist, by the way). Our local library was been closed for a couple of years for a major renovation and to save money (no good alternative was offered or created in the community). Not having a library is like losing the heart of the community. I find libraries superior to the Internet for what most people believe they get best online: random access to information and facts. Online, I don't come across things for which I am not searching. In a library, it is all there before me, waiting. Just walking through the reference room can lead to unexpected discoveries, diversions and, on occasion, new directions. We need both books and electronic information. Whoever imagined we needed to choose?	7949124	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

J. Mark Danley	4	0	I am always amazed at the number of people I see in a library. At the college where I teach, students pack the large computer center, use the stacks of books and study (just as I did 40 years ago) at the tables. The addition of small, private meeting rooms in our new facility allow students to congregate in study groups without disturbing others. Public libraries are also a hive of activity as people who struggle through the recession use the lending of books, movies and music to remain entertained at virtually no cost. Benjamin Franklin would be proud of this American legacy, yet so often it is the first to lose public funding. How sad that we take these institutions for granted and yet we refuse to provide for their necessary functions in our lives.	7956728	Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

If not, no wasted money or time. And sometimes I uncover new gems by this method. Something I didn't have the time to do at Borders.

lulugirl765	11	0	I work at a library doing tech, and just to be honest, the vast majority of people coming in to use the lab or free wireless are playing video games, watching YouTube, and working on their Facebook. I've had to deal with the FBI trying to track down people chatting on child porn sites in the library because the IP cannot be pinned to the user and privacy prevents the user from being identified. I see unemployed adults NOT looking for jobs but surfing the net entirely for fun, printing out tattoo patterns, downloading ring tones for their cell phones, and bidding on Ebay. We stopped offering computer training because nobody showed up for these classes. We offer small business website tools that don't get used. It's great to be positive about libraries in the digital age, and certainly my job depends upon this kind of idealism. But our book circulation is down, while DVDs and video games are soaring. The fact that laptops are the highest circulated item at the author's library is probably being used more for gaming than anything else.

G. Armour Van Horn	2	0	I didn't realize that libraries were an American invention. I knew that Benjamin Franklin established the first on in this country (almost enough to let me forgive him for floating the ghastly daylight savings time joke in Paris a few years later) and Andrew Carnegie is the only philanthropist I've heard of to devote his fortune to the cause. I thought we had just done our fair share in keeping up with our responsibilities. I don't use the library often, I'm too fond of instant gratification in book stores and too undisciplined to return books on time, but I'm convinced they are a great value in our communities and support them willingly. I also have more internet bandwidth than most libraries. Books and DSL are expensive. I may be crazy enough to put those equal to or even ahead of paying for groceries but it's crucial that others in the community have access to what I take for granted without making the same commitment.

Nora Martin	3	0	Having worked in the public library sector in Australia for over 20 years, I am a strong advocate of life-long learning and equity in access to information, thus I support the Open Access movement. In May 2012 I started in a fixed-term contract position at a University Library, my first foray into academic librarianship. As such, the topic of digital libraries and institutional repositories is of personal interest to me. The Open Access movement and institutional repositories have openly challenged the traditional scholarly communication system, supporting a new model for scholarly communication. Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms. Institutional repositories (by their very nature) exert pressure on journal publishers to permit as much free online access to their content as economically possible. The library and information sector plays an important role in providing public access to networked information. Public libraries worldwide are a significant component; by ensuring that there is equity in access to information (for both educational and recreational purposes) through the provision of quality library services for all citizens.	7979843	Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CET 2013	Do We Still Need Libraries?

merlin1350	2	0	No matter what libraries offer in the way of books, recordings, or automation, libraries are public places that are part of our commons. In a sense, loitering is allowed, people can meet, sit and think, study, and browse through a collection of books or recordings that most of us could never privately own and that can be actually borrowed for a period of time for personal use. A library is one of the few places left in our society where we can go and be in public these days, in which there is no commercial coercion to buy something. I have been a librarian for almost 40 years and have observed how valuable such places are for everyone, regardless of social class, religious affiliation, age, or political opinion. Where else, now, in America can we find that kind of free, universally accessible public space?	7954593	Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

Alison	3	0	Libraries are evolving, but they are no less important today than in the past. It may be easy to Google for information, but sometimes expert help is also needed. Trained information professionals may be the best place to get such help. The information may be relayed in person or online, but the support for research is crucial. Not all information, after all, is equal. Our library systems are a crucial foundation for our democracy. The Federal Depository Library Program was established by Congress to ensure that the American Public has access to Government Information. States designate libraries to collect and make available government information both in print and online. Libraries have to change while patron behavior and information seeking habits change, but they will remain relevant as long as inquiry continues.	7950729	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

At present I have access to both a county library and a nearby city's facility. Both libraries are always crowded with people when I visit them, many using the free computer services, some reading out of town newspapers, others browsing in the video and recorded book section. In my community, the libraries also provide free access to private community rooms where people can meet for many different reasons. Finally, my computer is great, but when I want to relax and read I want a good old fashioned book. Libraries are wonderful places and we need them.	7950363	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

I download audible books frequently, but I don't use my local northern NY library system to do it, I use the NY City Library. If I do want a book I locate it on Amazon (since its presentation of the book: description, professional and reader reviews is much better than the libraries) then I order it (on-line) from my local library system. When I get the e-mail notice that the book is ready I finally pay a visit to my library to pick the book up. Using this process I wonder why my library has publically displayed bookshelves at all.	7950351	Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

Rev. Karen Tudor	1	0	In our community, the most elegant, welcoming and practical buildings are our libraries. In the 9 years I have lived here, two libraries have been built and one redesigned and refurbished. Like the comments about the need for internet access among the poor, libraries ARE so much more. They have become a cultural, community hub for education, community activism, art, music, video and social interaction. One library has attracted the local gardening society to create and maintain a butterfly garden with many native plants that are marked for people to learn about them. Another group has offered to create a meandering walking path around the expanse of the building for reflection and a chance to walk in beauty outdoors. In many ways, I see our libraries becoming a sort of secular ministry -- feeding the souls as well as the minds of people. They are far from obsolete -- they are becoming more relevant and essential than ever before!	7955845	Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Still Need Libraries?

LaurieAG	4	0	In the early 90's I was studying Maths of Finance at university and fees and charges were just starting to raise their ugly heads. In hindsight Australia is about 20 years ahead of the US with regards to bank fees and charges and now the amount spent on User Paid fees and charges each year is equivalent to the total amount of profits declared by the Australian banks each year. I was curious and developed the Leveraged Depreciated User Paid Leasing system model at the time to calculate the consolidated impact of levying fees and charges per $1 unit on items that were already depreciable and leasable such as ATMs and PC's. It's not surprising that this simple but userous structure (with a 10%GST) can produce $1.36 in tax for the government and $2.56 in direct profits for the banks while the poor old user has to pay $6 for something that previously only cost the bank $1 in house and the government $1 from the public purse in depreciation, leaving the user and the bank with no net impost.	6097752	Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Banks Making Too Much Money From Fees?

Michael S	3	0	This problem didn't just arrive with recent regulation. Long ago banks started to look towards fining their customers as a way of making money. This was accompanied by deceptive practices used to maximize the amercable events ergo some of the regulations. Indeed hitting upon fines as a profit center coincided with discovering that gambling with the free money customers provided was more profitable than providing services to customers and the community - like making loans. We all know how that ended. Banks are a regulated industry (just like Wall Street) and the cost of doing business is offset by all that free customer's money and the banking monopoly (freedom from competition) created by the law regulating them. If retail banking is such an unsustainable business model, re-introduce the postal savings system or other government bank with expanded authority to make personal loans.	6102894	Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Banks Making Too Much Money From Fees?

D. DeMarco	32	0	My husband used an ATM from a different bank.He withdrew his own money, not a loan, not a cash advance on a credit card. There was a $3 charge for using the ATM. There was a $2 charge for checking the account balance. There was an additional $2 charge because it was a different bank's ATM. A total of $7 in charges for a single withdrawal, that did not require any actions by a bank employee, as was all handled electronically by computers.

Joseph Ross Mahew	2	0	I'm beginning to see that up here in Soviet Kanukistan, we have it REALLY cushy when it comes to the banking industry. There is open, honest competition between banks for the customer's business, for one thing: not apparent collusion between major banks to charge similar fees and stifle true competition!! I pay $8.5 per month, get free debit services, free checking, 10 ATM transactions per month, and my overdraft fees are only $5 per shot (thank goodness, lol!!). Most ATMs charge $1.5 for transactions not associated with their sponsoring banks and even the private ones only ask this much. I remember visiting the USA in 1998 and simply refusing to pay $3 just to use an ATM!!!! The USA is the richest country on the planet, with the hugest bank profits... looks like exploiting the poor and vulnerable in their society is one of the ways they GOT so rich in the first place.	6105088	Tue May 01 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Banks Making Too Much Money From Fees?

MH	1	0	The way banks structure their fees for their services is absurd. The free account but profits made through hidden unrelated fees no one expects. It is like grocery stores that offered all their food for free to pull the most possible customers from competitors. But then they charge random cars in the parking lot $100 for parking more than 10 minutes. They charge a $10 surcharge on exit for every child that enters the store (with no signs posted about this on entrance). And an assortment of other fees that change as people catch on. And yet people keep coming for the free food. When the store wants to increase profits it comes up with more absurd fees.	6104729	Tue May 01 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Banks Making Too Much Money From Fees?

Joan	2	0	This mess began more than 30 years ago when the government did away with the usury laws. Since then it's been open season on bank customers. With the rates imposed and fees added you'd think you were dealing with loan sharks. So far the only difference is that nobody drops by your house to break your knee caps if you overdraw your checking account, miss a payment, or move your money to a credit union. We need to reimpose caps above which no money lender or financial institution can impose fees, interest, or any other charges or fines.	6103367	Tue May 01 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Banks Making Too Much Money From Fees?

Lauren	1	0	Banks have to make their profits somewhere. Overdraft fees were very lucrative (if unsavory). The additional fees we're seeing now are a direct result of the decreased profitability around overdrafts. Consumers really didn't understand the extent to which overdraftees were propping up the free checking account for te rest of us. Also, some fees are designed to encourage unprofitable customers to walk out the door. And you guessed it. Small personal checking account customers who never purchase other products (e.g. mortgages), never generate overdrafts, etc. - we are the proverbial deadbeats. Big banks would love to see us walk to the credit unions. They will even hold the door open for us and wave goodbye.	6101724	Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Banks Making Too Much Money From Fees?

Carl	3	0	I agree with this only because the fees really are not explained well in the contracts, and are usually just one or two lines somewhere around page 18 of the agreement. These fees can ruin someone who doesn't know that he's over the limit. I have a friend who had to pay several hundred dollars in fees just because he and his wife made a few little purchases over a few days without realizing that they didn't have the money in their account. For someone making $2500 a month, $35 per transaction is a huge expense. I think what would fix the problem, though, is just not allowing banks to report nonpayment of checking account fees to credit bureaus.	6099765	Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Banks Making Too Much Money From Fees?

Jenny	9	0	I tend to be a loyal consumer. I do due diligence before beginning a commercial relationship, but then I expect that the companies with whom I do business will treat me with equity and respect. I recently received notification from a bank that I have had accounts in for more than 20 years. I have always had at least one paycheck being direct deposited, I have had 2 or three savings accounts, auto loans, and investment accounts. I have always played by their rules, but the interest paid on savings dwindled to next to nothing (.03%) while charges, fees, and penalties have ballooned. The final straw came a couple of weeks ago when a whole new list of fees came out. Not only are they going to charge for paper statements (I went paperless years ago), but they are going to charge for online access! And they are going to charge $5/month for savings accounts that don't have automatic deposits going to them. Enough is enough! I am switching to a credit union.	6101419	Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Banks Making Too Much Money From Fees?

And I'm always amazed at the different marketing tactics banks use depending on their target audience. For example, I have a relatively high income, while my sister's is low. We both have mortgages with the same large bank. Both of us pay on time every month. But I'm offered special low refinancing rates with no closing costs via FedEx, and the bank sends someone to my home free of charge at my convenience to close, while my sister gets no offers and in fact they refuse to refinance her house at any rate.

WimR	3	0	Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise. But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible.	12634091	Sun Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the U.S. Work With Assad to Fight ISIS?

Today it may not yet be an immediate danger to the US but it would be tomorrow once it consolidates its grip on the ""liberated"" region, its ""Jihad"" veterans would return home in the western countries like the UK, France etc and spread the mayhem there, it would plot from its ""Caliphate"" to repeat many more 9/11 until the ""western world is brought under the Caliphate"".

Samuel Elgin	1	0	Undoubtedly, ISIS is a well-organized terrorist organization that aspires to damage the United States in any way possible. The brutal murder of James Foley led some (like Ryan Crocker) to call for increased military strikes in Syria. However, we should not carry out such attacks without considering their impact on Assad's regime. Even an uncoordinated airstrike is likely to damped international pressure against him. It legitimizes his struggle against the rebels and diverts conversations away from his crimes against humanity. We must remember that Assad is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 of his own civilians - sometimes through the use of weapons of mass destruction. As the Syrian leader he had a special obligation to protect the very people he murdered. No one reasonably expects ISIS to carry out attacks on this scale. Military activity in Syria should only occur in the context of a struggle against an authoritarian dictator.	12642384	Mon Aug 25 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the U.S. Work With Assad to Fight ISIS?

At first they fought side by side with the al-Nusra Front (Ayman Zawahiri's men) and both groups blended with the Syrian opposition. That was fine with us as long as they did what we wanted. But ISIS had their own agenda all along, and it excluded al-Nusra and the dumb rebels.

Let the Sunnis that have allied with ISIL get to know them a bit better, and I am sure resistance will form eventually. The focus should be on supporting the Kurds only, like President Obama is doing right now. In these situations, patience is of the utmost importance. Let us see where the pieces fall first. There is no need to rush into anything. The current air support of the Kurdish Forces and supplying only them with sophisticated weaponry should be the strategy, nothing more and nothing less.	12628825	Sat Aug 23 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the U.S. Work With Assad to Fight ISIS?

Why not not follow the morally correct policy of non-intervention....here in may come to the often discussed but rarely published adage ""Let them kill each other off"" which poses no dangers for us.

James Currie	3	0	I would certainly agree we need to act together with Assad, however distasteful that is. Obviously the first step in trying to rescue this disastrous situation is that we need to encourage the Iraq government to form an inclusive executive involving the Sunni majority. Following that ISIS must be vigorously pursued and removed as a threat in the region and worldwide. If that means associating with a dictator then so be it.

Turnao	6	0	Yes. The US is on the wrong side. Dictators are terrible and evil people but they keep peace by consolidating power and preventing power vacuums that have allowed IS to run rampant across the Middle East. US foreign policy says that our nation has a fundamental right to protect freedom across the globe. This puts us at odds with Assad and IS. However, when determining what would be the most harmful, it is easy to see that Assad is the lesser of two evils. We have a duty to the persecuted. Persecution under IS > Persecution under Assad.

Jim S.	10	0	I used to teach Quantitative Reasoning. One of the databases we used to analyze was birth rate by country. That was over ten years ago, but it showed my students how high birth rates would become unsustainable in small countries without similar economic growth rates. The same countries we identified as problems back in that course are in the center of the refugee and problematic youth crises now. Just divide the birth rate (in percentage) into 70 and you get the population doubling time. How can an economically stressed country every imagine handling the doubling of its population in less than a generation? It doesn't make any sense to talk about overall wealth in the world, either, when people have no realistic prospect of any future access to it without migrating. I would try migrating too if I were in such a country.	15166351	Tue Jun 09 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Overcrowding a Legitimate Threat?

But does not our economy and our whole way of life rest on the foundation of a consumer society? Without the populace subscribing to and participating in a society dedicated to making or marketing things and buying them, how do we structure society then? What do people do in lieu of buying stuff? How is power accorded and meted out? How do people obtain the necessities? How do they generate income?

GBC	1	0	"The apocalyptic predictions of what would happen as a result of the ""population bomb"" are eerily similar to the apocalyptic predictions we are now hearing concerning climate change. The conclusion there was a ""population bomb"" was proven, incontrovertibly the so-called experts said at the time, by a statistical extrapolation of past events which assumed that what had occurred in the past would continue to occur in the future, with no factoring in of the many independent adaptations which were made by people everywhere as a result of the situation. These adaptations largely occurred as a result of natural forces such as increasing costs, the search for greater productivity, the search for a higher standard of living, and not as a result of government actions, not because of a lot of ""we have to do this"" or ""we have to do that"". It is because of situations like the ""population bomb"" scare that people are skeptical about scientists and environmentalists and their proposed actions on a climate change, and that skepticism is justified."	15164058	Mon Jun 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Overcrowding a Legitimate Threat?

One doesn't hear ""god will take care of us"" or ""we have always found new sources of oil before"" as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products.

nydoc	3	0	This blurb fails to mention that man yyears ago, Professor Ehrlich made a highly publicized bet. With his Malthusian doom and gloom, he predicted resources would be scarcer and run out, or at least dwindle as the world population grew. He bet a not so famous economist that prices of a half dozen commodities jointly chosen by them would rise after a decade. He lost very big, as the prices went down about 30% instead of increasing. It is fairly obvious that their is a certain limit to which resources would be strained. But the focus is totally off. Poverty causes population growth, not the other way around. Scandinavia, almost all of Western Europe and Japan all have rapidly falling populations, which would be even worse if it were not for immigration. Too prevent over-population, reduce infant mortality, increase education (particular for girls), increase the standard of living (how???). Over-population, poverty and environmental degradation are all closely linked. But it is important to note that increasing living standards is the best way to combat over-population.

Shep Harmon	2	0	Population growth is explosive, but not exponential. We have a certain, predictable expectation of what the maximum number of beings will be on the planet over the next few decades. That number, be it ten or eleven or twelve billion, represents the high end of expectations. It does not adequately factor in the enormous drop that can occur if women were to be more universally empowered. The known unknown is how much benefit will accrue to the planet due to the extraordinary exponential impact of technology. We are seeing early evidence that major advancements in renewable and fossil energy development, vast improvements in consumption reduction, agricultural methods to reduce excessive water waste and so much more are coming from technology. We are also beginning to very significantly reduce the commodity usage from items made for our entertainment and activities. I submit that earth will provide abundant resources and see massive positive results due to exponential technological improvements that are coming and are so significant when compared to linear population growth.	15162932	Mon Jun 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Overcrowding a Legitimate Threat?

pdxtran	16	0	Worldwide, there is a direct correlation between the average educational level of a country's women and its birth rate. In countries where the average woman has at least the equivalent of a high school education, birth rates are low, below replacement level in some cases. In countries where the average woman is illiterate, birth rates are the highest in the world, partly because such countries allow no way for women to gain status except by bearing a lot of children, preferably sons. Within individual countries, educated women have fewer children than uneducated ones. Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth will level off.	15164598	Mon Jun 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Overcrowding a Legitimate Threat?

Les Dreyer	2	0	Laurie Mazur talks of women's rights being the key to population, a mantra embedded in the Rio Declaration of 1992. But this approach, which came to dominate the population field, has not lead to a significant reduction in fertility in many of the most overpopulated countries. Unfortunately, the well meaning leaders of the women's reproductive rights movement have not yet confronted the rights of the future generations of this planet that resources will not, and already cannot sustain. Are they to be doomed to a grim life of chaotic climate, food and water shortages and no jobs? What is clear is that the world is not sustaining the thousands of refugees drowning in the Andaman Sea and Mediterranean Ocean escaping an unsustainable existence.	15170116	Tue Jun 09 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Overcrowding a Legitimate Threat?

DAN	28	0	There is another way that our population growth will be our undoing: There are not enough meaningful jobs on the planet for the number of people who are already on it. With our efficiencies in production, and the limits to natural resources, this problem will get worse over time. We do have a population problem, a serious one, but it is more than just numbers and how to feed them. We can make it so large numbers of people do not die, but that doesn't mean this planet can be manipulated so that those same large number of people can truly live.	15164771	Mon Jun 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Overcrowding a Legitimate Threat?

Marla Burke	18	0	I live and work near Muir Woods. There isn't a day without smog hovering over the area. The neighborhood does not suffer density issues and there are no manufacturing facilities anywhere near the whole region. Yet, the smog in all its reddish-purple-haziness never flags. It comes out of the west from China. Over one billion people manufacture the good that seven billion of us need and it is killing us with polluted air, water and as an unsafe food source. All of this damage is done in the name of a single word: profit. It's time that we redefine that word or we will certainly die out as a specie.	15163742	Mon Jun 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Overcrowding a Legitimate Threat?

Maxkr	6	0	"Most people might as well get their news from Facebook. Why? Facebook provides no context for the news and most readers cannot provide it either. Facebook news may or may not reflect world or local truth. Traditionally, newspapers provided both news--the what, where and when--and the context--the how and why. That is disappearing. Even the NY Times does not report the religion of attackers and attacked in the Middle East. As a result, ask most Americans and they have little clue that the fighting is sectarian. Where are the facts about the free college platform the Bern has been advocating? Where is the money needed to keep college doors open?

Bruce Rozenblit	20	0	Here is what scares me most about Facebook as a primary source of news. As a traditional consumer of news, I actively seek out information. That is, I search news sites, (this one primarily and a few others to a lesser degree) to find out what is happening in the world. In doing so, I learn about things that I most likely would never discover on my own because I didn't know they existed. Much of the under 40 crowd is oblivious to my news world. They only know of news that hits their Facebook page. The news comes to them. They don't seek out the news. They are passive consumers while I am active. In doing so, the range of information they are exposed to is highly limited. This is dangerous for an open society. Being fed bits and pieces of news based upon browsing history, buying habits, or selection fields greatly restricts what goes into ones head. Reading a newspaper is an act of discovery. Being fed a restricted news stream is a path toward puppetry.	18552100	Tue May 17 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Facebook Saving Journalism or Ruining It?

This is especially true with regard to tastes, and appreciation of flavors.

Rich H	1	0	I learned to salt in culinary school. If the cooks and the chef are SURE of the flavor level of every dish, then keep the salt off the table. But not every food preparer is perfect.

Jim L	4	0	I watch enough cooking competitions (on TV) to realize that 4 chefs at a table will not all agree as to the quality and complexity of the seasoning upon the palate. Now add 2 or three courses, and remove the trained palates from diners who may be there for reasons other than the chef's concoction, and you may realize that salt and pepper belong on the table to satisfy the the varying palates of those paying to dine. I like a bit of salt on my salad, especially on tomatoes or the bread which is put on the table. At home in the shaker, we use salt that has the lowest amount of sodium (approx. 280mg per serving) and we have a grinder as well. I rarely add salt without taking a bite first. I have also had dishes where I wish i could remove salt from a dish. Leave it on the table. Those with health concerns and have minimal will power, ask to have it removed from the table.	9948974	Wed Sep 11 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Salt Have a Place at the Table?

However, I do cringe when I see individuals immediately douse their entire plates in salt and/or pepper when the plates are presented, before even a bite of food is taken.

Most baked or roasted poultry dishes are horrible without some added salt and there are other foods that cry out for it- popcorn is a good example. Having worked in healthcare for 27 years I have no illusions about the harm that a high sodium diet can have on some people. However, it is also possible to wisely reduce salt intake and still enjoy it in some foods. As the taste is highly subjective and individual I cannot agree with Mr Sbragg.	9944695	Wed Sep 11 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Salt Have a Place at the Table?

Julie B	4	0	Biology plays a role in an individual's perception of how salty something tastes. If a chef insists on making the decision of how to properly salt a dish, then some will perceive it as over salted and some as under salted. It's a lot easier to add more salt than to remove salt from food. I always prefer a restaurant to go easy on the salt, and allow me to add what I feel is necessary for my tastes. Otherwise a number of diners are forced into eating food that they might enjoy more, if allowed to have input on how it's salted.	9953448	Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Salt Have a Place at the Table?

Kenneth Thomas	2	0	Big Brother my left petunia cheek. What does Mr. Kurlansky think the average consumption of salt in the US population is? My mother recently passed from cronic heart failure. I tracked her usage, desperately, in the preceding years. 1200mg was the recommendation. I've seen the epidemiology and statistics, been trained, consulted with the best and brightest-- and knew, that was too much. Unless I was fighting her tooth and nail, she was at 2200 or 2500mg. One component of lunch could be 1500mg. KFC or Pizza Hut? There goes 1800mg in one part of a sitting. If I went away for a few days? 4500mg or 6000mg. Aimed at a dying heart. Mr. Kurlansky's deception and irresponsibility in writing the above, should be criminalized.	9956027	Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Salt Have a Place at the Table?

Michael Cosgrove	2	0	I disagree. For some of us, such as runners who go out in the sweltering heat for a long distance run in the desert, replenishing the salt and electrolytes lost during the run is a matter of health and recovery, not merely a flavoring option. I can understand that sedentary people and some chefs might blanch when the see me salting my food at a restaurant. But I'd like them to realize that I am doing so almost as a medicinal application and would prefer they reserve judgment until they've run a dozen miles in my shoes.	9953236	Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Salt Have a Place at the Table?

don	3	0	The chef's vision, blah, blah, blah. Every so often at at otherwise decent restaurant, the chef of the moment under salts the food. Just plain and simple, they miss the mark. I understand, that happens, the food doesn't turn up on the table just as the chef intended when the dish was created. I am talking about a case in which the executive chef, were she tasting the food herself, would consider it under seasoned. In such a case when I am spending $38 on an entree, would the restaurant prefer I send it back and refuse to pay, or eat it and grumble about it on Yelp, or simply shake a little salt on it and be happy and tip well? It is the restaurant's choice. In addition, salt is not cinnamon. It is an absurd comparison. An under salted dish is unpalatable. A dish with less than optimal cinnamon is still fine.	9952772	Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Salt Have a Place at the Table?	More restaurants have been doing without salt shakers.

Zeke27	1	0	Salt, pepper, condiments are as much a part of the dinner table as the flatware or chopsticks. I love to sprinkle fresh herbs on my food, including pepper, parsley, cilantro, and dishes of chutney and relishes are a staple part of many other cuisines. Relying on the chef to match my taste is like relying on the sound man at a rock concert to keep the music at a bearable level. The chef is often as deaf as the sound man.

They certainly would not be invited back, as I would figure they might as well stay home and prepare food to their own liking. Same for salt. Personal taste? Perhaps.

Rob	2	0	I may be going against the grain here, but although I agree that it is the customer's right to add salt, it is generally no longer an integral part of the cooked dish.

DLH	18	0	In fact, the research on this point is now more in favor of salt than against it. And for people not near the coast, the iodine in salt is necessary to prevent goiter. I go to a lot of restaurants these day where there's hot sauce on the tables and people douse their food with so much that I wonder how they can taste anything. That's their choice; if salt is mine, then supply the salt. Restaurants are supposed to be about cooks serving the customers, not about those who are paying bowing to the 'vision' of the 'chef.'	9944713	Wed Sep 11 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Salt Have a Place at the Table?

mamarose1900	1	0	Nice post. I have a similar situation with one of the people I cook for. He has high blood pressure and is on a salt-restricted diet, but doesn't follow it very well. He always adds salt to my dishes, but no one else does. I think we all have different tolerances for salt and different palates. Everyone needs to be able to make their own decisions. I'm also with you on sugar. Even before I got early type 2 diabetes, I was reducing the sugar in recipes because they tasted too sweet to me. The amount of sugar overwhelmed the other flavors. But that's another topic for another day. :)	9949264	Wed Sep 11 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Salt Have a Place at the Table?	More restaurants have been doing without salt shakers.

Meredith	12	0	Once standards in culture, entertainment and politics are debased, it's much easer for media conglomerates to take advantage of this to rake in more profits. People don't know any better, so they don't have the standards any more to judge quality. The entertainment or media product can be easily assembled without real talent. This goes for our politics too, where the most outrageous platforms are offered to voters, in the expectation that these garbage proposals will get a candidate elected. What are being elected are junk candidates, but many voters don't realize it. They have often voted against their own interests, as has been widely noted. Once junk seems normalized, it's not called junk anymore.	5611072	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

personne	2	0	Not dumber. But definitely leaving behind much of the education that makes life and conversation with others fascinating. Business majors may avoid fine arts, literature, language and history. Those aspects of education are handy when dealing with people of other cultures. If politicians during the Bush push for war had had even conversations with journalists in the Middle East for a decade or more, they may have had some grasp of the enormous tribal and religious ties therein, and perhaps have not proceeded so. The society of the nineteenth and twentieth century was fostered by education that was broad and deep. By the 1990's and later, music and art were narrowing and the ability to discriminate what was good was replaced by what was accepted. We are dropping old attitudes and replacing them with fashion. The ability to discern and choose what is good is set aside for the rush to be considered aware and clever, and worse, cool.	5656362	Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

With the advent of access to everything in every- ones face all of the time one begins to complete the question asked a celebrity or politician and actually believes that they have a grasp of most abstract concepts, when what they really own is a brief exposure to everyday pop consciousness. This consciousness in invariably the same one exasperated by one or two original sources usually the first to get there on an opinion or worse a twitted diluted version of the original idea layered with sloppy delusion. I suggest that everyday individuals fancy themselves experts on many subjects. Yes they are exposed to much more but do not really sweat the details of an individual program except for their own work and that works knowledge. Are they smarter? Not really because doing is what counts and we have become a society of voyeurs. Individuals fearlessly opionated on varied subjects. True abstract thought is looked at like an alien and difficult to ascertain that is why people are amazed at new art it suggests and usually reflects our present time viewed through fresh eyes.	5632722	Wed Feb 29 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

Students no longer focus well or have the stamina to see through difficult problems. If they cannot solve a problem quickly, they give up (move on to next question, kids, time is running out).

Dr. Ebbyguru	21	0	As a prof for 34 years, people ask me whether students are getting dumber or smarter. That would be very hard to quantify even with the most sophisticated measurement instruments. Empirically (that means observations done more or less scientifically) I see that there are still those that have it (intelligence, critical reasoning, a thirst for readiing, cognitive complexity) and those who don't (or just don't care). Additionally, most of us profs notice that there is a huge gap between those haves and have nots and that there is a huge gulf of mediocrity in our young people and citizenry. Unless you count ability to distinguish between Manolo and Jimmy Choo shoes, we are definitely becoming dumber.

Pearl Lambie	7	0	My personal experience is that people are getting dumber. In the last few years, i have actually had office personnel who literally could not file- did not seem to understand the alphabet. This was unheard of twenty years ago- at least with the alleged degree of education some of these people have. During this recession, which to me does not seem to be over, i have been astounded at the many people hired who do not understand that if i want them to do a certain job, they had better perform it or they won't have a job! They are actually shocked when fired, even when given several verbal and written warnings. And of course i see typos every day in the print media, and not just low quality media either, although i suppose it is due to lack of editors or an over-reliance on spell-checker. i am getting more forgetful because of age but i still seem to have a better grasp of general things then the kids half my age. Maybe their brains are disturbed by all the things they are exposed to at much too young an age- like television or texting.	5612280	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

serban	30	0	This is a dumb question. The US population is very diverse and becoming more fragmented. We have a two-tier educational system that is providing a decent education for the affluent and a miserable one for the poor or near poor. There is a sizeable minority that is anti-intellectual and anti-science, who feel religion beliefs are being undermined by modern concepts and morality. On the other hand the scientific education provided by the elite graduate schools is the best in the world and better than ever. Unfortunately most of the people taking advantage of that education are either foreign born or first generation Americans. The rest prefer to become lawyers, get degrees in business administration or get jobs in the financial sectors. The pursuit of wealth trumps pursuit of knowledge for those whose families have been Americans for more than 2 generations. The most worrisome trend is not that the population is dumbing down but that social coherence is being lost and greed is replacing a sense of social responsibility.	5613161	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

brublr	9	0	Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them	5611944	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

george	23	0	An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII.	5613523	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

So, kids who (if) they vote are basing their decisions with no knolwledge. Not to mention the sophisticated understanding that is required to understand this complex world. I don't want to appear cynical or paranoid but do the super rich or corporate interests prefer an electorate who knows politics and history -- or does it serve their interests as people become stupid and no nothing except about football or celebrities. Stupider! Yes, for sure. Absolutely! And it explains why high school students no longer take civics and know nothing.	5611176	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

Bob	12	0	I have taught at elite universities for the past 43 years. Before that, I served three years as an enlisted man in the United States Army and taught arithmetic to students in surveying students at the engineer school at Ft. Belvior. From this limited experience, I can make two observations. Students at elite universities have grown stronger in the last four decades and the state of American secondary education in 1964 was awful. Enlisted men who had had be selected to learn surveying had mathematic skills that were so weak we did not try to teach lowest common denominator when we covered fractions. I don't think we are getting dumber and we still have a system that can discover talent in students from less privileged backgrounds. The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator McCarthy and his list of communists in the State Department, the hysteria leading to the Spanish-American War, the American Civil War and a very long list of disturbing events in Europe from the Holocaust to the Crusades. Be cheerful. It has always been this good or this bad.	5613636	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

roberto	2	0	I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary.	5611741	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

Charles	8	0	Again, Pinker is only looking at certain strata of the population, the best-educated. He is ignoring the obvious evidence that a lot of poorly-educated people do not have the survival skills that our ancestors had. It is probably true that worldwide, a lot of abstract reasoning skills have diffused more widely among the general population, causing a rise in performance on IQ tests. However, when I've taught young people (as a volunteer), I've been astounded at how wide the gaps are between the small proportion of kids who can read and write and think, the largest group, who stumble over the simplest texts and cannot read aloud, and the group who don't even know what reading and writing are. Clearly, something is going on. Pinker is willfully avoiding it, because it's an embarassment to the liberal elite of which he is a part, and who are largely responsible for the decline in educational standards.	5611676	Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Are People Getting Dumber?

It's funny how the domestic carriers are all for deregulation and increased competition in theory, but once outside foreign airlines are involved, they rely on what you rightfully point out is antiquated regulation. Fact is that Americans really only have a choice between four airlines for domestic travel and are subject to the whims of these companies. The airline industry is a monopolistic entity and should be treated as such.

KL	10	0	Personally I think airlines don't care about any of their workers. They most certainly don't care about the flying public/customer. This is reflected in the faces of all who are shoehorned and buckled into tiny seats. Like all other jobs today we humans are disposable workers, flight attendants included. I can handle a surly or neglectful attendant on occasion for it is a tough, demanding position but we can't let the airlines cut corners on their pilots. This worries me tremendously having worked for the airlines in the past. These mostly highly trained professionals are being abused and not paid decently. Don't get me wrong cabin crews are important but the person in the cockpit can not be marginalized or treated poorly. I think we can all agree that safe, happy and well rested and trained pilots are crucial to the business.	18641085	Wed May 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Does the Airline Industry Need to Be Regulated Again?

Marshall Meyer	9	0	Airline deregulation was driven by the theory of contestable markets. The theory doesn't work when there are no new or potential entrants, which seems to be the case today. Almost unnoticed, however, the Acela has reduced air travel between New York and Washington, DC by half. High-speed rail in other corridors will likely do the same. It is only a matter of time. Still, miserable in-flight conditions should be regulated as matters of health and safety. Minimum pitch (legroom), seat width, and luggage space, perhaps dependent on flight duration, should be considered. Passengers in seats without overhead luggage space (the last two rows in many 737s) should be permitted to check baggage without charge. And seats should be held for passengers who have unavoidably missed connections.	18636157	Wed May 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Does the Airline Industry Need to Be Regulated Again?

Tom	18	0	I would agree that fares dropped between the big hubs, but for us who live in the hinterlands and have to drive 2 hours to an airport which is served by a grand total of 2 airlines, not so much. Airfares on the two airlines are always within 10 dollars of each other. The airfare for a 45 minute flight to the hub is about the same as any flight from that hub to any other destination so the end result is flying costs twice as much than if you flew from a hub. The end result is the hub and spoke system results in lower fares where there is competition and a virtual oligopoly at the end of each spoke. Granted, it is not a monopoly which would cause scrutiny, but the airlines collusion acts like one. Add to that, most of the flying public knows what happens with a weather related problem at a hub. The ripple effects throughout the system impact much more than just one hub. Sorry, deregulation resulted in much higher fares and much worse service when weather intervenes.	18637273	Wed May 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Does the Airline Industry Need to Be Regulated Again?

The only bright spot is the foreign carriers on trans Atlantic flights--a trip to Milan via Emirates last summer was a pleasure, with legroom, edible food and a choice of 500 movies to watch for free. Regulation of things like legroom and full disclosure of fees sounds like a good idea to me.	18646939	Thu May 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Does the Airline Industry Need to Be Regulated Again?

Dick Dowdell	6	0	Free market forces work well when there is a direct and obvious connection between the purchase and the consumption of goods and services. Not so well, when the provider of the goods and services is able to hide price behind layers of obfuscation and indirection. The airlines, very much like health care insurers and providers, make it almost impossible to know up front what you are buying and what it will cost. Just like health care insurers and providers, the purchaser of air transportation is often a business with a different set of priorities from those of the ultimate consumer --- we the people. Under those circumstances, only intelligent and knowledgeable regulation can work.	18645683	Thu May 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Does the Airline Industry Need to Be Regulated Again?

If you think that the private health insurance market will work just fine, it means that you've never tried to get health insurance in the individual insurance market. I can only hope that once the GOP takes away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that people will come to their senses and stop voting them into office. Unless you are rich/own a business you have no reason to vote for a Republican. They simply do not support legislation that benefits the lower and middle classes.

The Republicans, and libertarian groups like the Cato Institute, think that the ""market knows all and can fix all."" A foolish assumption ignoring decades of reality. Turning Medicare into a voucher program and letting people ""shop"" puts all the financial burden onto the backs of people who can least afford it. Healthcare costs will continue to rise until a ""pay for quality and results"" model gets fully implemented. Without that these vouchers will never be allowed to grow in value equal to the healthcare inflation rate. So they will become less valuable and the poor and seniors will suffer. In an ACA-type model, or better yet, a single payer model, implemented with a solid ""pay for performance"" component, the government shoulders the burden of increasing healthcare costs, not the poorest and most vulnerable, and the government takes the responsibility of driving pricing reform because individual consumers cannot do this."	20645885	Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2016	Does Medicare Need to Be Reformed?

It won't be able to do that if the number of people getting benefits isn't fewer than the people who pay into the system. This is how some get more benefits than they put in.

Any intelligent person can tell this is a hoax to give the rich more tax breaks. Why can't Ryan tell the truth. He is a Pinocchio who can't stop lying. A well known enemy of poor people. Catholic Churches have come out against him. Seniors who voted for Trump were conned.	20647288	Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2016	Does Medicare Need to Be Reformed?

LCan	5	0	American Enterprise Institute, I do not want any more choices. I am an attorney, still with most of my faculties intact, and I cannot make heads or tails out of the 'choices' before me (and my 96-yr-old mother) for healthcare. Mom had Humana for Part D prescription insurance for many years, until they KICKED HER OFF (because she was in a new zip code, having moved from Houston to Austin YEARS before.) I found out when the pharmacy called to say Humana would not approve her BP meds, after years of paying premiums. Medicare, thank goodness, did not kick her off... I cannot understand all the options before me for my or mom's Advantage or supplement choices. I tried to use the exchange for my health insurance, and finally gave up, because my self-employment and irregular income did not jibe with the system. Please, NO MORE CHOICES-- do whatever is needed to address funding issues, costs, etc. to keep Medicare healthy, but within the framework of a single-payer system.	20645525	Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2016	Does Medicare Need to Be Reformed?

Matt	3	0	Oh yes, let's allow fat cat insurers to come into Medicare and siphon off profits! There are some things that are just not meant to be governed by greed, and healthcare is one. You want to turn health care for the elderly into a used car lot? The elderly are perhaps the ultimate prey, and you want to unleash the healthcare vultures on them? Look around at the civilized world, look at Medicare compared to our current insurance companies, and you can tell me with a straight face that this is the direction we should go? You have let your ideology build a bubble from rationalization and denial of the real world.

""Under current law, the growth of Medicare spending will be restrained in other ways during the next two decades, thus limiting the potential for the government to realize further savings from a premium support system."" And, ""...spending for Medicare is projected to be restrained by provisions of the Affordable Care Act that will change the ways and amounts that health care pro- viders and insurers are paid."" Why go through such drastic changes to a system to save 6% ""as a Percentage of Net Federal Spending for Medicare""? Particularly when those ""savings"" are costs picked up by the enrollee or pocketed in profits by private insurers or provider? Not that 6% (45b) is anything to laugh at, but surely a small uptick in my taxes would cover this?"	20648193	Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2016	Does Medicare Need to Be Reformed?

Justice Holmes	1	0	Monopolies as monopolies are always dangerous which is why when one is permitted it must be under the tight control of the government and it must be by law committed to the betterment of the customer's interests and those of the public. Once a monopoly is permitted it is no longer a typical corporations competing with others. It is by definition the only place that a consumer can turn for that product or service thus its power to abuse that situation is massive and must be strictly controlled. It's price structure cannot be allowed to be government only by the corporations interests and the way it conducts its business must be a matter of public scrutiny. Google is no different....it has already shown its monopolistic tendencies by freezing out other content and preferring serve results thst are beneficial to it and its partners thus depriving users of intimations that may be beneficial to them. My preference would be not to allow any monopolies and to break up any that occur through mergers or other corproate transactions.	18365988	Fri Apr 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Google a Harmful Monopoly?

Brother Bill	10	0	Walmart could do a public service by opening its supermarkets in the inner city ghettos. But the real health benefits will come only when folks consume a whole food based plant diet. The problem is that animal products, such as meat, fish and dairy CAUSE chronic disease.

Of course, if Walmart were to eliminate selling meat, dairy, soda, tobacco, alcohol, sugar, candy, junk food, etc., then nobody would shop there.

When I see obese parents with obese children, I want to ask them, ""Don't you love your kids?"" When I see shopping carts full of giant bottles of soda and packaged food, I want to ask them if they need help with their food choices. But I realize that confrontation would be counterproductive. The desire for change has to come from within, and educating by continually sending the message is the only hope. Head Start programs, school lunches, soup kitchens, and many other public arenas are starting to make healthy improvements in some parts of the country.

GAMom	2	0	I was glad to see some of the opinion-writers acknowledge that we really don't know the effects on individual behavior and population health of changes like the ones WalMart, New York City and others are making in food content, availability, pricing, and information. These changes -- banning trans fats, reducing sodium, posting calorie information -- are made with the best of intentions: to improve individual and population health. But if people simply eat more, or salt food by hand once it disappears from processed food, or drink GatorAde rather than soda, we really won't have made much progress. There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing. Consumer education is great, but forced choice structural interventions would likely do more quickly to move us to a healthy population than consumer education would.	3283814	Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CET 2011	Can Wal-Mart Make Us Healthier?

John Duggan	12	0	A drop in the ocean The real problem is the mountain of cheap, processed carbs consumed daily by cost-cutting and ill-informed shoppers and their families. A vast industry exists to supply giant quantities of really bad food, which our bodies were never designed to consume. These commercial interests find it very convenient to have low-fat, low-sugar, low salt campaigns to attract attention away from the real vilain. Until people learn what they should be eating, and eat a lot less than they are now, it's not going to get better.	3281451	Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CET 2011	Can Wal-Mart Make Us Healthier?

John Lawn	8	0	The new school meal guidelines from USDA will be far more of a game changer than anything WalMart does. They also will be far more effective in terms of giving manufacturers good reason to invest the money and effort to develop new products that meet the guidelines while maintaining taste. The fact is, such products on the shelves of WalMart will always have the competition from less healthy products such as you allude to. If you want to sell the vast school market, the playing field will be level. The real question is whether local school boards will accept the idea that they can't use school food programs to cross subsidize education, and that Federal school meal reimbursements need to go towards school meal production, not school bureacracy overheads.	3281388	Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CET 2011	Can Wal-Mart Make Us Healthier?

Tiffany	1	0	I believe being forced into treatment numerous times saved my life. It have me a chance to clear up and realize my own powerlessness. That allowed me to learn about recovery, learn about a new way of life and become open minded to it. I wish i could say i stayed clean after being forced into treatment but i didn't. I had to hit a bottom and go in to treatment on my own, but the seed had already been planted and i had knowledge about recovery from the past experiences of being mandated to programs. I've been clean now two years.	16676760	Tue Nov 17 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Drug Addicts Be Forced Into Treatment?	Massachusetts Gov.

Mark P. Kessinger	1	0	Seems to me that, well-intended though this proposal might be, there are some unconsidered and very serious unintended consequences that attend to it. Do we not understand that a program like this will have the effect of preventing many drug users from seeking medical attention when they need it? And would such a program apply to alcohol and tobacco users? Yes, I know they are legal, but they are still drugs, and in many cases every bit as destructive of a person's health, and certainly every bit as addictive, as many 'street' drugs. Would such treatment be 'forced' on people who are, say, simply casual users of an illicit substance? (Notwithstanding the hysterical anti-drug propaganda, in the case of most illicit drugs, there are indeed casual users who can use the substance recreationally without falling into the throes of addiction. This kind of approach would most likely result in fewer, not more, addicts receiving treatment.	16657096	Sat Nov 14 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Drug Addicts Be Forced Into Treatment?	Massachusetts Gov.

Robert Roblin	8	0	In August I lost my husband and partner of 10 years to suicide after 4 long years of dealing with meth addiction. He did not think he had a problem while concurrently I watched his cognition decline to the point he concluded death was preferable to seeking help. Over the last four years I dealt with his violence while crashing and using behind my back. I sent him to the finest rehabs in the country but since he did not believe he had a problem our fate was sealed. I don't know if this proposal will work but I do know our mental health system has no idea how to deal with addiction. What's worse, most people dealing with addicts, dead or alive, are embarrassed to discuss it. We have a cultural problem solve before we turn to involuntary incarceration.

Will	2	0	I disagree with coersion being the option. An addict won't beat addiction until they want it for themselves. Addiction is a selfish disease and it takes the selfish mind to want to beat it for themselves. You can't coerce a person against their will to see the light. Forcing a person into withdrawals and hope they see the good in it afterwards is a gamble. Not all addicts are the same, so I believe in individual based treatment that focuses on the reason for the addiction, psychologically. To face those demons, a person has to want to face them.	16633832	Wed Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Drug Addicts Be Forced Into Treatment?	Massachusetts Gov.

Norman	2	0	"When Dupont refers to ""research,"" I assume he's referring to his linked report, ""Results from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,"" and to Figure 7.10 in that report, the pie chart labeled ""20.2 million needing but not receiving treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use,"" which says that 95.5% said that they ""Did not feel they needed treatment."" Among the problems with that chart is (1) they don't tell how they defined ""needing"" or determined who ""needed"" it (2) they they include marijuana in the category of ""illicit drug."" The bulk of those 20.2 million could be marijuana users. Even with heroin, amphetamines and cocaine, you can't just assume that because somebody is using that drug, he or she is abusing it or ""needs"" treatment. Many people function well even while using those drugs. For example, Ayn Rand used amphetamines. Allen Ginsberg used amphetamines.

Christina	2	0	As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done . Just like mandatory seat belts in all US states the same could be argued for mandatory substance abuse treatment	16632994	Wed Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Drug Addicts Be Forced Into Treatment?

Steve	8	0	Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem? Clearly, none of the debaters has really given much thought about the many ramifications of their recommendations.	16631741	Wed Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Drug Addicts Be Forced Into Treatment?

John	9	0	I think protecting people from decisions society does not agree with is a slippery slope. Just as freedom of speech is the right to say unpopular things others would disagree with, liberty is the ability to make choices others may not agree with. If your drug use violates someone else's rights, perhaps because you steel from them, you can already be imprisoned. We already have a mental health commitment standard if you are a danger to yourself or others. With alcohol, there are some who use to for health benefits (a glass of wine with dinner) or recreationally (a couple bears at a party or while watching a game). There are others who end up killing themselves. During prohibition, well meaning people attempted to protect everyone from alcohol. It was a disaster. If we coerce drug treatment, where do we stop. Do we commit obese people who are not compliant with a weight loss program? How do we protect against false committed.

B.	1	0	Just as some schizophrenics must be coerced into hospitals for the good of society, so must drug addicts. When people think they're just fine, but they're beating up their elderly parents (who won't press charges, believing that home is the safest place for their wayward offspring), then they need to be forcibly removed and treated. They may have severe emotional problems, but they're still a menace. When people addicted to drugs follow old ladies home from the bank, push them down, and steal their pocketbooks, fracturing their hips and forearms in the bargain, they need to be removed from society. They may be addicts, but they're also criminals. Sorry I am for all suffering.

That is why almost 100 people a day are dying from heroin which is one of the most addictive substances there is, and that is why most die no matter how kind, how helpful, or how much treatment they have had. American affluence has produced a society of obese and drug addicted people, and unwanted and abandoned babies and young men.

Build them and then just maybe they will come. Where I live (pop. 230,000), there's exactly one small, public rehab center currently with a 6-8 month wait list. We simply don't have the infrastructure in place to accept (or force) people into receiving help. Honestly I don't think the money nor the will is really there. A lot of lip service from our politicians. I question the Gov's proclamation. Did not anyone on his team do the research to discover we've no place to put them?	16633208	Wed Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Drug Addicts Be Forced Into Treatment?	Massachusetts Gov.

njglea	9	0	Treatment is much better than jail or prison but neither seems to have much of a track record for helping the addicted. I know parents who have sent their kids to treatment multiple times and the addict takes up drinking or drugs as soon as they are released. Treatment is expensive and WE pay for health care for the homeless and hopelessly addicted who live on the streets or at the bottom of the social ladder. Proven treatment that works and is affordable - Yes. A simple money machine for providers with little or no success in treatment - NO. The BIG problem is getting to the Yes.	16632351	Wed Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Drug Addicts Be Forced Into Treatment?	Massachusetts Gov.

But I can assure you, I will NOT, as you say, encourage them to ""consider competing in the Miss American pageant."" NO WAY. I will vociferously DIScourage them from doing so. Any ""scholarship"" competition that asks my daughter to put on a swimsuit without asking them to actually swim; or put on a dress that she has not designed and sewn herself is NOT a competition we want to be involved with. Any job or school that asks her to submit a photograph of herself for the purposes of judging her attractiveness: also, no. It's a farce, Ms. Friedman. You've been sold a false bag of goods. You don't have to be slender and gorgeous to be a scientist, musician, policy advocate, or any other such important job. Not even to be a TV pundit. Well, if you're a man, anyway.

Nancy	11	0	LOL - I love the fact that even though the NYTimes clearly weighted the debate in favor of pageant supporters, the idea that a beauty pageant is somehow a great thing for women is getting completely slammed in the comments. Men are considered to have too much individual dignity and worth to be judged on something as shallow as what they look like in a bathing suit. That's why beauty pageants are only for women. We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of little girls and young women, thanks to trashy parents.

M	24	0	Most of the smartest women I know aren't competing in pageants...and the opportunities these pageants provide in cash for a few women do not undue the harm that they cause for the millions of others that watch. The only 'brainy' thing the women do on stage is anwser a one-line question. Even the volunteering component is still a bit silly. Given that volunteering is now a pre-req for college admissions, these women don't achieve much more than their peers do.

I had a plan in place when I was competing, which has evolved and continues today in every aspect of my life. As Miss Maine 1990, competing at the local, state levels and then at Miss America opened the door to many opportunities.

Laura	34	0	Oh, and to answer the question: Yes, they are bad for girls. When girls are constantly judged on their physical appearances, it is bad for their self-esteem and sense of worth. I don't think very many men really understand this. I'm not the sort of woman who believes that my beauty doesn't give me ANY power with men. But, the thing is beauty is different from other sorts of positive attributes. Sure, I may think I'm beautiful, and therefore, I'm beautiful. But that's not really how it works. I can only be beautiful, really, if men deem that I am so. My physical beauty isn't really about me. And, it gets me nothing but your approval. Who says I need your approval? I always look at beauty as necessary, but meaningless. My beauty makes other people treat me better and makes my life easier in some ways, but it doesn't do much for me otherwise. It will never be the reason why I love myself. It will never be the reason why I'm proud of who I am. It will never tell you anything real about me.	9972616	Fri Sep 13 00:00:00 CEST 2013	There She Is, Miss America	In 1968, feminists gathered in Atlantic City to protest the Miss America pageant, calling it racist and sexist.

Annika	3	0	I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program.	9967935	Fri Sep 13 00:00:00 CEST 2013	There She Is, Miss America	In 1968, feminists gathered in Atlantic City to protest the Miss America pageant, calling it racist and sexist.

Josh Hill	4	0	Human males have strong instincts to select mates with good physical attributes. Women therefore seek to compete. The same phenomenon can be observed in insects, birds, and other mammals. Displays of fitness vary, and in some it is the females rather than the males that make the displays. So -- what is wrong with it? The process is comfortably Darwinian and it has contributed to our success as a species. I don't see why political correctness should be allowed to get in the way of that -- not that, in reality, you could argue men out of their attraction to beautiful women anyway.	9971336	Fri Sep 13 00:00:00 CEST 2013	There She Is, Miss America	In 1968, feminists gathered in Atlantic City to protest the Miss America pageant, calling it racist and sexist.

Drugs give an edge to one's performance, yes, but it doesn't mean that the athlete is actually capable of doing that without drugs.

If, as an athlete, I don't want to take drugs or genetically mutate my body to improve performance, I may as well not even show up.

We could move to a Formula 1 model, where the driver is racing for a team, which is sponsored by a major car manufacturer. In analogy, an Olympic athlete would be competing for a team of physicians and trainers, promoted by a major drug company like Pfizer, Bayer or Roche.

Liz R	6	0	Whoever sees room for debate here is just shoveling sand into the growing tide of public revulsion against doping in sports. And the public is right. When the doors open to performance enhancement drugs, they close for the person who does not wish to take drugs in order to compete. I'm not sure exactly who benefits from that outcome, but it's definitely not your kid swinging at softballs in the backyard this summer. Why call it sport if it's to become just a contest to see who can round up the best set of drugs plus the most short-term-minded, health-reckless contestants, coaches, doctors and parents? There was a time when sports competition was about sport. Against great odds today, it still is that for some competitors. They give their best effort and accept either defeat or triumph as just a part of every game, not its only measure. Those competitors are worthy of being our kids' sports hereoes. Who are they now?

Gloria	2	0	There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other). Would games become even more a show of force between the haves and the have nots?	6812570	Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should Doping Be Allowed?

Tom	5	0	This used to anger me, now it doesn't. The drugs are here to stay. Olympic athletes use them, pro wrestlers, mixed martial arts, cyclists, baseball and football players, runners, even the young guys in the gyms around the country. That's why you see so many young men who look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. They don't spend 7 hours in the gym everyday to look like that..They spend about an hour per day, take a boatload of pills, powders and/or some injections, and eat a pretty good diet with low carbs and lots of protein. I can lift as much as a lot of them, but I'm a bald old guy who doesn't inject anything and I look like it. Who the heck wants to look like me? We need to just let it go. If their livers rot out by the time they're 40, that's their problem. They already decided it's worth looking and performing like a stud for a short time, rather than a noodle for a long time.	6812058	Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should Doping Be Allowed?

Tal Barzilai	5	0	Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use.

When the adults amongst us see arab muslims grant and respect the sovereign rights of others in the middle east, including the kurds, yazidis, azeri, bahai, cop tics, maronites, chaldeans, maneachans, and jews, THEN I might begin to believe that the relentless, mindless commitment to war and violence by arab muslims against all others might be ceased, and there might be peace achieved in the mideast. The juvenile pandering by feckless, hypocritical European regimes 3,000 miles away from the nearest hostile arab muslim-majority state affirm the general lack of respect that should be granted to the European perspective. Their dictates as to how Israel should be treating a population whose majority supports terrorism against it are wholly meaningless. Bargohouti of course offers the usual bile about Israel and a 2-state solution, and then exposes himself as nothing but a despicable liar by demanding that millions of arab muslims be allowed to move into Israel, despite have no legal foundation to do so.

These other governments would expect any Palestinian government to prevent attacks by its citizens on Israel or any other country. Recognition by other countries would make it easier for Palestine to fulfill the basic elements of statehood. It would rally Palestinians behind a policy that was achieving some change. Of course, they have to rally behind the policy to the extent that they will help the police track and stop extremists, even if the extremists are relatives. But in the West Bank this has been pretty much achieved. If Israel could abandon some of its settlements and prevent any terrorism by extremists who opposed this abandonment, and Palestine could prevent terrorism by extremists who opposed the recognition of Israel, we would have something workable.	13081146	Fri Oct 17 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Recognizing a Palestinian State	Should nations recognize a Palestinian state?	/roomfordebate/2014/10/16/should-nations-recognize-a-palestinian-state	Nations should not recognize a Palestinian state	Nations should recognize a Palestinian state	false	false	Nations should recognize a Palestinian state

An equitable solution for peaceful coexistence can be found for all the people of the area - but not while Arabs still dream (the cold peace with Egypt and Jordan notwithstanding) - with the moral support of the hypocritical Europeans of destroying Israel, wholesale or piecemeal.	13082209	Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Recognizing a Palestinian State	Should nations recognize a Palestinian state?	/roomfordebate/2014/10/16/should-nations-recognize-a-palestinian-state	Nations should not recognize a Palestinian state	Nations should recognize a Palestinian state	false	false	Nations should not recognize a Palestinian state

mj	22	0	Easy commentary from an academician. I'll wager Ms. Lechner doesn't work in such an environment. In fact I know she doesn't. When did we get to the point where grinding employees into the ground and out the other side is de rigueur? Well that's easily answered. We got there when quarterly profits became the be all and end all for existence. Yes, wouldn't it be scandalous if we went back to a world where people worked to live rather than lived to work? And here is the dirty little secret of all this supposed high performance: when was the last time you went to company and something actually worked the way it was supposed to work? Anybody? People are putting in massive hours and things run more poorly, are managed more poorly and produced more poorly than they ever have been. The formula clearly only works if you are at the top of the food chain raking in multi-million dollar bonuses. For the rest of us... pound sand.	16021999	Tue Sep 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Hard at Work	Can companies excel without making workers miserable?	/roomfordebate/2015/09/08/can-companies-excel-without-making-workers-miserable	Companies can excel without making workers miserable	Companies can't excel without making workers miserable	true	false	Companies can excel without making workers miserable

Rocketscientist	14	0	If businesses want highly productive workers they'll start by changing the goals of the HR department from parts replacement to cultivation. Find out what motivates employees to work there: it will be different for each as they are individuals. Next, monitor managers: if they go through staff it must be for a reason. Fix him/her or replace the manager. Second, get rid of the annual review or the promise of an annual bonus. Instead, establish annual awards that allow anyone a chance at a big prize. I've made significant contributions to companies where I've worked and seen my hard work go to some hand-picked politico who did little but criticize me while I did the major lifting. The same with the annual review. Simply offer the worker more if he deserves it and be done with it. If the employee wants a review then let him/her suffer through it.	16022936	Tue Sep 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Hard at Work	Can companies excel without making workers miserable?	/roomfordebate/2015/09/08/can-companies-excel-without-making-workers-miserable	Companies can excel without making workers miserable	Companies can't excel without making workers miserable	false	false	Companies can excel without making workers miserable
Jon Davis	15	0	My first job back in the 1970s was minimum wage. I worked in the evenings Monday through Saturday unloading trucks and stocking shelves at a now defunct chain store similar to a Target. The schedule kept me out of trouble. But more importantly our store had a manager, a co-manager, an assistant manager, a manager trainees and about 100 employees. And every member of management treated every employee, including me, #100 on the list of 100, with tremendous respect and truly believed that we all have to want to be there in order for us to be productive. Did I mention the store is now defunct? It seems that such wonderful management practices, that formed me as a young adult and which I have attempted to carry on today, are just not sufficiently profitable.	16022644	Tue Sep 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Hard at Work	Can companies excel without making workers miserable?	/roomfordebate/2015/09/08/can-companies-excel-without-making-workers-miserable	Companies can excel without making workers miserable	Companies can't excel without making workers miserable	true	false	Companies can't excel without making workers miserable

Gerald	34	0	It can be different elsewhere. The social democracies of Northern Europe do a much better job of reining in the worst aspects of market capitalism. In Germany, companies with over 100 permanent employees are required to have a works council where employees are represented, often by colleagues who themselves are union members. Employers are also restrained, via carrots and sticks, from mass lay-offs and firings. I spent five years with a German high tech start-up (now one of the largest software companies in the world). Their flat organization, light-handed management style, and care for their employees gave me the happiest five work years of my life.

Tournachonadar	19	0	American culture enshrines one thing: success. In the business world, that means profits. We sacrifice our happiness, relationships, mental health and basically everything else worthwhile in life to achieve a higher bank balance and end up with more assets than those with whom we have been taught since preschool to compete. And then occasionally a little voice pipes up, whether it's from a child, a coworker, a spouse, whomever, reminding us that there are more things out there than our narrow pursuit of gain. But having sold our immortal souls quite literally to pursue wealth, we shut those voices out. Bullying is a virtue in this inverted world where the crassest jungle version of capitalism is to be found.	16020227	Tue Sep 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Hard at Work	Can companies excel without making workers miserable?	/roomfordebate/2015/09/08/can-companies-excel-without-making-workers-miserable	Companies can excel without making workers miserable	Companies can't excel without making workers miserable	false	false	Companies can't excel without making workers miserable
Ken H	46	0	In a recent NYT editorial the average executive earns over 300 times more than their average employee. In 1980 it was 30 times greater. The editorial pointed out that productivity has increased by 72% since the 1970's while pay that has been adjusted for inflation is up only over 8%. The Los Angeles Times points out that independent contractors receive no unemployment insurance or are subject to overtime rules. Union membership now stands at around 6% of the workforce. Any worker who complains on any social media platform is foolish. So yes, telling yourself that you are happy at work does make it easier to go to work. When you look at the data the American worker is clearly being duped by management.	16022621	Tue Sep 08 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Hard at Work	Can companies excel without making workers miserable?	/roomfordebate/2015/09/08/can-companies-excel-without-making-workers-miserable	Companies can excel without making workers miserable	Companies can't excel without making workers miserable	false	false	Companies can excel without making workers miserable

He minimizes the issue of stagnant wages since the Reagan era and concedes that wages should be rising faster. Then there's the rather amusing understatement that ""the balance between capital and labor is a bit out of whack"". That wages rose over two hundred years is hardly a comfort and less due to the wonders of capitalism than the labor movement which, until thirty years ago was a significant force.

Having said that it is important to have a job that is rewarding and to have rewarding time away from work. If you hire good people and treat them like good people you will need fewer rules.

Most of the Arab immigrated there parallel to the Zionist immigration in the new era. Read the Ottoman census, the British census and understand the Arab names and origins.

Israel. The issue is whether the U.S. can be an impartial mediator in the dispute. And it cannot. The U.S., for better or for worse, wrongfully or rightfully, has a 'special relationship' with Israel that will always, always, always come first. Regardless of the current state of affairs, of who is on the 'wrong' or 'right' side of the latest iteration of the conflict, the U.S. is in Israel's corner first and the peace process's second.

John Hartung	21	0	President Obama received a Nobel Prize for Peace because so many influential people were so convinced that he would pursue peace by resolving the nexus of antagonism that separates the Muslim and Judeo-Christian worlds ... by ending the policy of making Palestinians pay for what Germans did to Jews during World War II. More than any other president, Obama had the opportunity to advance peace by advancing justice when the Palestinians made their bid for statehood at the United Nations last September. If Obama had supported that effort, every nation in the world except Israel would have voted in favor of the motion, and Israel would have gotten the message that it is time to be as seriously forthcoming as J-Street advocates. Instead, he betrayed the Palestinians and isolated the United States more forcefully than has yet become apparent. If Romney is elected, that isolation will become fully manifest. If Obama is re-elected, there may be a second chance to earn that prematurely awarded Nobel Prize. Yes, support for Israel has hurt U.S. credibility.

Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future.	6955947	Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Has Support for Israel Hurt U.S. Credibility?

Lou Novacheck	6	0	The NYT is a couple generations late with the headline. For right now, however, what the US needs to to is become selfish and self-centered, in the realpolitik. We have way too many things wrong with this country to cast stones. Jobs, out of control USG eavesdropping, political candidates who eyes show no truth, only $ signs,, etc ad nauseum. Israel and its supporters have been crippling the US for far too long, and they've now found another hook in the form of Iran. Israel has controlled ... yes, controlled! our role in the Middle East for far too long.

LA	22	0	No doubt about that!! I am a Turkish guy living in the US. I can see both sides of the argument. In my opinion, US has to stay neutral between Persian, Arabs and the Israel to be able to pursue its influence in the region. Right now common belief is US is unconditionally supporting Israel and this is hurting its interest in the Middle East. Remember this: Jews (Israel) and Muslims (Arabs, Iranians...) have been fighting for centuries, nobody can stop that. So, why would you position yourself in the middle of the conflict you know nobody can win. I think the answer is; because strong American Jewish lobby, Middle Eastern Warlords and the US Weapon Manufacturers want that way...	6954749	Sat Aug 25 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Has Support for Israel Hurt U.S. Credibility?

Jabberwocky	26	0	I am not clear on what Shared Values Mr. Miller refers to. Israel is based on the Zionist premise of a Jewish state and this philosophy does not grant equal rights to all citizens. This is in total conflict with US values and is akin to apartheid South Africa -as pointed out by Nobel Prize winner Desmond Tutu. As for Israel first influence, it is not only the impact of the agent of a foreign government (AIPAC) but also wealthy donors like Sheldon Adelson who can provide the funds needed to make or break a domestic political campaign. What is worse is that many of these wealthy donors are more politically concerned about Israel than they are about the USA.	6949308	Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Has Support for Israel Hurt U.S. Credibility?

Falcon	14	0	As long as the US continues to advocate a two-state solution, it will be perceived as pro-Israeli. For the occupation of Palestine to be reversed, and for the apartheid to end, a much more radical solution is needed, namely a one-state solution with equal rights for jews and arabs. This is seen as a major blind spot in US foreign policy. There seems to be no concerted effort to end the oppression of Palestinians. Why not? Everyone assumes that the pro-jewish lobby would never countenance that sort of change. So the impasse continues ad infinitum.	6954416	Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Has Support for Israel Hurt U.S. Credibility?

Shaun Narine	17	0	I think that Mr. Miller is really burying his head in the sand here, to the point of undermining his own credibility. This seems a prime example of wilful ignorance. It is true that the Israel Lobby does not have a veto on US policies towards the ME, but it comes awfully close. It is apparent that domestic politics has a far greater influence on this issue than any other foreign policy issue. In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre. Strong and inventive Presidents have been effective in the ME in the past, but their achievements have been limited and none had to operate in the kind of politically polarized domestic political environment facing Obama.	6951667	Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Has Support for Israel Hurt U.S. Credibility?

Anon	5	0	edthefed is right. Shared values is not a sufficient reason to form an alliance. An alliance should also be mutually beneficial. Allying with Israel is not in the US interest. The problems that Israel helps the US with are mostly issues that are problems for the US only because we are allied with Israel. We should distance ourselves from both Israel and the Palestinians and pursue normal relations with other Arab countries like Tunisia and Oman on their own merits, not as part of a worldview that makes everything revolve around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict is central to Israel, but not to the US. Or, rather, the only thing that makes that conflict important for the the US is the alliance with Israel; ending the alliance ends the issue as a central problem for the US.	6953761	Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Has Support for Israel Hurt U.S. Credibility?

mzmecz	1	0	So taxing capital gains is double taxing income? OK so why should a laborer be taxed on his income after the first year of his career? His income is taxed and what's left over, his gain, is reinvested as capital into his service business: food which maintains his strength, housing which provides the location of his enterprise and the sundry other expenses that maintain his life so that his business may continue. Perhaps it might even grow into a larger enterprise, a family with several lines of business. If corporations can be people can people not be businesses? Can it be argued that he does not have a service business? Can it be argued that food is not a necessary input to the continuation of his business? I know these are not traditional perspectives, but I think them equally valid. We should tax lightly but evenly every inventory turn, personal or corporate.	7002549	Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

AngelaM	6	0	That's where we've been heading and it's just going to get worse. Those of us who need to work for a living, and that's most of us, will be paying the bills and the rich and superrich will be collecting the rewards. And as for 'job creatiion', those will be the low-paying service jobs that the superrich so desire. More maids, nannies, horse-trainers, chauffeurs. Downton Abbey for the 21st Century. There will be riots in the streets ultimately and there should be. The lives they have in mind for us and our children will not be worth living. And when you have nothing left to lose you can start burning down the world you are forced to live in.	6893364	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Hamish	2	0	There is no economic argument for taxing income differently, depending on its source; income is income. Such arguments as we typically hear are theological debates, whose partisans hope to pave their way to a personal vision of heaven. The double taxation argument is groundless; in the first case there are many other examples of double taxation, and in the second empirical evidence does not support conservative claims about disincentives. One could also argue that the tax on labor is a disincentive to work, but for some reason that seems to have less traction - could it be because wealthy people - whose right to speak more loudly than the rest of us was recently codified by the Supreme Court - are less concerned about it? From a strict economic viewpoint, all income should be taxed equally. This would avoid the huge incentives - and wasted, non-productive investments - in gaming the system, that firms and investors routinely make. The opportunity costs of those activities are literally mind boggling - but never discussed.	6892783	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Whats worse, to my thinking is that people I know well enough to ask aren't that interested that someone else does. That disinterest, as far as I can see, represents an attitude less of ambivalence, than the far more worrisome kind...resignation. As any investment, compared to any other investment, will likely reflect as much on means as intentions, it might serve to consider that a tax policy that fosters, for lack of a better word ...hording ..might just run counter to the thinking of those of us who think that economic development and refinement are to be preferred to, perhaps...oh... atavism.	6891806	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

seeing with open eyes	12	0	When capital gains resulted in true investment, the argument that lowering it spurred economic grow for our nation made some sense. But capital gains in the 21st century arises much more from gambling. Trading equities in micro seconds, electronic trading that churns thousands of shares a second, looking only at todays, or even only at this minutes gain in the is not investment. Such activity isn't based on searching for companies that will do well in the long haul. Even management of pension funds and IRAs is done primarily for the fees charged by the investment managers who don't care it the funds go up or down, only if they get their piece. So actually capital gains tax rate should not be reduced or eliminated. It should be raised to the same rate charde on gasmbling monies sine it is now exactly the same.	6891749	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Carol A.	11	0	I think it's about time that we treat ALL INCOME the same. If an investment earns a yearly dividend, those earnings are new money (earnings) and should be treated the same as wages or the interest on my personal savings account or my certificate of deposit. To allow capital gains to be taxed at a lower rate than the few hundred dollars in interest on a senior's CD is to place a higher proportional burden on the retiree than on the multimillionaire who is currently running for President. I'm looking for fairness with this issue.	6897401	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Old Professor	5	0	Conservatives often claim that taxing capital gains is double taxation. This is a fallacy and a myth. People and corporations are taxed only on their earnings. So if a person saved $50,000 and earned 5% interest, they would pay taxes only on the $2,500 in interest. The original $50,000 would remain untaxed. How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits. However, if most of the corporate profits were in the form of capital gains, then it may smarter to take the income as profits (two 15% tax rates results in an effective tax rate of 27.75%).	6896685	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

David Iverson	43	0	I make a modest wage, but because of being a life-long investor I have a good portfolio. About $40k of my income comes from my salary and $10k comes from investments. For that $40k I get up in the morning, drive to the office and work hard for eight hours every day. For that $10k in capital gains all I do is spend thirty seconds a month transferring money from my checking account to my mutual fund accounts. In my opinion it's offensive to tax money that rolls in with almost no effort at a lower rate than money you have to earn by hard work. Don't tell me that the rich work hard for their capital gains. I know how hard I work for mine and the answer is thirty seconds per month. Tax the lazy.	6896297	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Doc	4	0	But let's stop taxing reinvestment and the effects of inflation, which really are not gains. If someone sells stock A and uses all of the proceeds to buy stock B, the seller has reinvested. Why are we de-incentivizing reinvestment. If stock C appreciates only by an amount corresponding to the rate of inflation, it's also not a gain. The solution is to replace income taxes by sales taxes, with exemptions for necessities, no matter who purchases them. Then those who don't buy luxuries would pay no taxes at all.	6895964	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

A	4	0	Eliminating tax on capital income would benefit me. However, I don't have a high income, nor do I make crucial contributions to domestic economic growth. All my spendable income is from interest, dividends, and capital gains. The total is about the reported median Adjusted Gross Income of Federal tax returns. (I have non-spendable taxable income due to converting money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.) I don't think it would be fair for me to pay no income tax while someone with the same amount of income from labor pays income tax.

Michael Smith	14	0	I am disgusted at the premise of the article. How bad do things have to get in this country before sanity takes hold about taxes? The decline of the United States started with Ronald Reagan's presidency and the introduction of supply side economics that favored the rich and penalized the poor. Twenty years later we live in a nation with a middle class that is now poor, and a tiny slice of the population that holds virtually all the wealth. Our bridges and roads are in disrepair, our prisons are full, our schools are failing, our colleges are unaffordable, our jobs are in Asia, our government is corrupt, and our corporation operate like criminal predators. And the NY Times prints an article posing the question, should we eliminate the tax that rich people pay on income from investments? What a disgrace! The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. And the writers here that advocate abolishing the tax on capital gains should be shunned as the moral degenerates that they are; they should be treated as anti-social pariahs, like meth lab operators or child molesters.	6899006	Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Bank interest is double taxed, and capital gains are and should be taxed. Contrary to the arguments that I see here, passive income is the most lethal of all to our social structure because it compounds wealth into the hands of a few lucky winners (sometimes just lucky enough to cheat), and deprives society, as a whole, of any chance to maintain a fair playing field for future generations. Capitalism is an amazing, but flawed human invention. Every once in a while capitalism and capitalists go awry. We are living in one of those times. We just need to fix that, and everything will be fine...........including the deficit.	6897746	Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

J T	2	0	We should have consumption (sales or VAT) taxes and capital gains taxes should be 50 percent declining one percent per quarter reaching zero in 12 1/2 years. The corporate tax rate should be zero, and C Corp. earnings should be taxed like S Corp. earnings. That would eliminate the cause of cash hoards in Corp. treasuries, and provide more liquidity. Most current deductions other than catastrophic loss should be eliminated. Charitable deductions should be more limited if not eliminated, especially for organizations that propound political positions (churches that mention politics, policy think tanks, and all political advocacy groups). But look out for the European outcome with high VAT, income, dividend, and capital gain taxes like Germany where too large a share of GNP is run through government accounts. We should have very little reliance on income taxes as they discourage both work and business. Those mega yachts, and mega dwellings are a simptom of the foolish tax laws we have now.	6897388	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

dschrader	13	0	If taxes on capital gains were pushing capital to other countries, we would see elevated US interest rates. Since that is not the case, clearly US capital is not flying overseas. If there is a lack of productive investment, it is because demand for goods and services is depressed - why invest in new construction/capital goods/consumer products when millions of people are out of work and demand is low? We have a demand problem here - the solution is to increase demand - more gov't spending- esp on those who will pass a high % of the gov't funds on to businesses - i.e. the poor. This will stimulate demand - lower interest rates, not taxing capital gains is just pushing on a string.	6896910	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

This will, as is well known, only encourage further tax avoidance schemes, since the reward is now a complete free ride.

This kind of untaxed capital gains will create a lot of speculation in the market and will eventually bring the market down. for what it is worth the short term versus capital gains at least has slowed some speculative activities.

In the meantime, the Democrats should stop the class warfare attacks by demonizing people like Mitt Romney who legally pay lower taxes because most of their income comes from dividends and capital gains.

Civres	2	0	The notion that higher US capital gains rates divert investment abroad to countries with lower rates is simply wrong. Because of our economic vigor and stability, and because of the (comparative though still less than perfect) integrity of our legal and financial institutions, the US will always be the most desirable choice for investors-and capital gains taxes (and other taxes) fund the regulatory, educational, and market infrastructure that make economic growth and individual business success more achievable here than anywhere else on earth.

Floretta	2	0	I can have all sorts of long and short term capital gains within my regular IRA and tax rates on them are bupkis until I either roll over money to a Roth or withdraw from my IRA - which money (including gains) is then taxed like regular income. Conversely, gains in a mature Roth IRA aren't taxed when I eventually draw down from that account. Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates. Interest earned on FDIC protected savings accounts of $250K or under (the account balance, NOT $250K in interest) should also be exempt, and above that fully taxable. This would protect middle class savers should they ever actually see interest beyond pennies in their accounts.	6892705	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Kevin Wires	3	0	There are a lot of reasons that revenue stays in the US regardless of the tax rate on capital gains. The stability of the government and protections from governmental nationalization are one large reason. The military strength of the country eliminates the thought of a takeover which would change potential ownership of ones own wealth. This is why the rich periodically call for amnesty (money not immigration) to bring their foreign wealth home to the US. That is because it is safer here. The rich's desire to return to feudalism where the poor carry the full burden of Government expense. Why is interest and dividend income less taxable than a workers paycheck? We fight many of our wars to protect the investments and projects of one or another rich group or company. It only makes sense that the rich contribute to the upkeep and maintenance of the country. I guess it really is hard to appreciate a five star meal when you know the poor are still eating something. It just isn't that satisfying.	6892628	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Uncle Joe	1	0	Almost every other large nation that I looked up has a capital gains tax of 20% or more, and many other countries levy additional taxes for their social safety nets. The IRS still taxes US taxpayers on foreign investments, but allows credit for any taxes paid to a foreign government. In other words, unless they imitated the Facebook guy who renounced his US Citizenship, investors have been paying taxes on foreign investments all along. Given that most corporations are multi-national businesses, very few investors are putting money into purely foreign companies. As far as the impact on development and the job market, demand and growth opportunities have much more to do with where investment money goes than nominal differences in capital gains taxes. Slashing capital gains taxes just doesn't magically create jobs. We've had 30 years to figure this one out.	6892504	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

George S.	1	0	The money has to come from somewhere. If capital gains are untaxed, that means that the income tax system will become extremely regressive, with the wealthiest Americans paying virtually no taxes, and/or another tax, such as a national sales tax (also regressive) would have to be implemented. Since this scenario takes a lot of dollars out of the pockets of average people who spend their income, demand would take a huge hit. How would that impact growth and job creation? Miron's proposal is, of course, just another permutation of supply side economics. It WILL be unfair, and it won't work.	6892035	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

oxfordon	4	0	I am surprised that the Times should give this crackpot idea so much space. Capital gains is the income of the rich. Are the rich supposed to be exempt from taxation? They depend on society to produce their riches. In late-Victorian Britain, the argument was the opposite. Non-work income was 'unearned income' and was taxed at a higher rate. And spare us the argument that low taxes on capital gains promotes economic growth. Under low capital gains tax (since the 1980s) growth was slower than in the post-war periods, when taxes were high. And virtually all the benefits of growth have gone to the rich.	6891432	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

Taxation is but a bump in the road to those bent on earning millions, a price of doing business. No one would pass on making a wise investment because of taxes, just as no one with a good business plan would not start a business because of high taxation.

From the way things are running this far in to Bush's ""temporary"" tax cuts all I can picture is a series of mansions with mattresses high in the air over all that frozen cash. Face it, Mr. Miron.

Harmon Bryen	42	0	I have never understood the concept of the tax advantaged capital gain. Some say the gain has already been taxed when the income ws earned to make the investment. By that standard, only ordinary w-2 income should be taxed at standard marginal rates. A person who purchases 100 shares of XYZ for $50.00 a share and sells it to another investor for $100.00 a share makes $50.00 a share. Not one penny goes to XYZ company to, say, purchase equipment or even better, hire another employee (unless of course it's an IPO). It seems to be just another tax advantage written into law by millionaires for the benefit of the wealthy investment class. Tell me that people would not invest in capital markets if there was no tax advantage and I would laugh. It would be like suggesting that people would not work as plumbers or accountants if they did not get a tax break of 50%	6890481	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

BCW	45	0	The single largest source of capital for companies is the profits on the things they sell. The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate.	6890097	Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?

fly4val	4	0	Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me.

Tom	3	0	"For some. success is achieving things that makes their parents proud of them, and results in others looking up to them. But in some cases this is meeting the expectations of others, not necessarily oneself. People need to have the independence (from their parents) to develop a sense of who they are as individuals. I would argue that a mature individual achieves success when they do things that make them feel good about themselves (for example being a social worker rather than a neurosurgeon) regardless of what others think I am reminded of lyrics from the song Garden Party sung by the late singer Rick Nelson - ""you can't please everyone so you've got to please yourself""."	3235302	Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is Extreme Parenting Effective?

Kosmo	83	0	The parenting Amy Chua is selling as Chinese is actually very common everywhere. I've seen many parents pushing their kids hard to take useless piano and violin lessons for reasons more connected with snobbery that the talent of the kid and I've seen people that parents pushed hard to become doctors or lawyers who at some point when they discovered that they are free adults that can make their own choices turned their backs at those careers and often at their parents. This is not Eastern philosophy, just an over controlling parent that is using her power over her kids to achieve goals for herself. Most shocking is her audacity to present her attitude as a way to follow.	3231362	Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is Extreme Parenting Effective?

Rayenna	3	0	In my opinion, these discussions skirt around the obvious. Some of these practices that Ms. Chau engaged in are nothing short of child abuse, plain and simple. There is no question that structure and discipline are necessary components of childrearing, but to justify belittlement and punishments such as she describes, is to advocate abuse. She is lucky she was never reported to an abuse registry. Her parenting style is devoid of soul, and most likely will be replicated by her children upon the next generation. But what, in fact, have you truly created? Does this advance the cause of humanity...or robotics?	3282588	Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is Extreme Parenting Effective?

Robert Stirling Morris	2	0	There is a great responsibility to parenting. There can be great satisfaction by doing it in a conscious manner, not by taking the day to day events as inconveniences to be ignored and letting the nature of physically growing be the only achievement. A parent does not own the child, nor should they be friends.....they should be respecting confidants with the parent as the guide. The object is to let the child learn how to be happy by experiencing and then discussing. If achievement of any kind makes the heart glow, that is where the child will go. We can only hope that the we have instilled a respectable goal search.	3236524	Sat Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is Extreme Parenting Effective?

Mrs. Lin	3	0	great article - as a child of a 'western-parenting style' family who is married to an asian man who grew up with the same chinese-style parenting addressed in her article - I believe that this kind of parenting WILL eventually create independent, thoughtful adults - who have the confidence and skills to succeed in this competitive world. I admire my husbands' values - in college, he pushed me to do more than I ever thought possible - and he has instilled high expectations in me for academia, life and yes, even health! He doesnt hesitate to tell me I need to workout - as she indicates she would not hesitate to tell her daughter the same - simply because it is for her own good. Honesty is true love. High expectations in all aspects of life reflects admiration; for the person you are inside, for the person you are with and even for your children. As a undergrad major in sociology - i've studied parenting styles and its effects on long-term success - her method simply works and the vast statistical data I've come across supports it.	3234956	Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is Extreme Parenting Effective?

seattlesh	4	0	It would seem that Ms. Sun and parents that express a similar style or view of parenting ignore the primary goal of child raising that of having a reasonably happy child. The emphasis solely seems to be that of raising and exceptional child with varied skills and academic achievements presumably so that they are financially successful. As a teacher friend of mine once observed to me, exceptional children (students) comprise a very small percentage of any given class that he taught and that most students were average or a bit above average in their intellectual abilities and creative talents. A small percentage was below average. Is it any wonder we have raised generations of children who think that they are special, entitled and dependent on mood altering drugs. It is perfectly okay to be a plain ordinary good human being. In our present economic conditions most of us know or are aware of twenty somethings of various skill levels and educational achievements who have moved back home with their parents because they cannot find employment. Maybe this humbling experience will teach some of them that they were sold a bill of goods by their narcissistic parents.	3234923	Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is Extreme Parenting Effective?

La Rosser	4	0	In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate.	3234363	Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is Extreme Parenting Effective?

An example she gave was rather than have them (force them) play piano or violin, she would perhaps let them choose flute or cello. That is her idea of the meaning of choice. Very, very sad.

But, the main reason for their downfall appears to be the fault of the big banks in the first place by accepting and trading their weak sovergn bonds just like the subprime mortgages. If they won, the bankers would keep the money but if, as it is, they lost then the Euro governments have to pay. Such an illogical arrangement should never be allowed to exist.

ernstgh	4	0	The readers of NYT should read the Economist. There the result of the bet the Greek are willing to take are explained clearly. If the Greek vote the Euro deal out they will face a much harder austerity package starting as of that moment. The gap between income and expenditure has to be bridged in one day. Anyone can imagine what that means. In spite of labor unions, politicized civil servants and the public opinion, massive lay offs, cuts of social benefits and salaries in the public sector, a paralyzed business community etc will result. But if they want that nobody can stop them. I would think it wise if Merkel and Sarkozy told Papandreou today in Cannes that the patience of the EU with Greece is immediately over and that they will propose to the other Euro countries that Greece leaves the Euro. It is a disgrace and an insult to the member heads of state what Papandreou has done. Greece will remember I hope. And the consequences will be dire, not only for the Greek I fear.	4803078	Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CET 2011	Will Greece Destroy the Euro Zone?

Michael S	14	0	Containing the Greek fallout will not cure the systemic ills of this half baked-monetary union; half baked because it lacks a central economic authority which is politically impossible to achieve. Europe can buy up the debt of the tiny Greek economy but it can't save Italy or Spain. Moreover, if referendums on bailouts become the vogue the euro will go to hell in a hand basket sooner rather than later. Papandreou had no support for the austerity program and wisely sought to spread responsibility among all Greek political parties; whats to stop the unpopular Berlusconi from doing the same in Italy? Because the euro lacks a central authority the tendency of its members is to ride roughshod over democratic principles to contain crisis.	4801633	Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CET 2011	Will Greece Destroy the Euro Zone?

jlanderson	15	0	No, Joe, the fault lies with the Greeks themselves. As part of the single currency, they were able to borrow boatloads of money at rates based upon the financial strength of the strongest countries in the EU, namely Germany. And there was no possibility of their ever being able to repay it; they simply hoped (as we did) that the party would be never-ending. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is NOT primarily the fault of the U.S., Wall Street and the 2007/08 financial meltdown. The meltdown simply exposed the euro for what it has been since 1999: a fake currency built upon smoke and mirrors. A real currency is predicated upon a common culture, a common language, a common political structure, a common tax structure, a common social structure, a common history. The euro was simply the creation of bureaucrats who were unable to pull off the social/political/financial union needed for the euro to be a longterm success. This crisis would have happened sooner or later, no matter the trigger.	4801661	Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CET 2011	Will Greece Destroy the Euro Zone?

Reverend Tracie Plungis	1	0	If the USA Embassy is truly 100% constantly strong and unified in supporting Israel's right to exist, Israel's right to be a Jewish nation and Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital then yes and amen, stand bold and strong with the uncompromised rights of Israel. USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice.

Reid1	3	0	Ostensibly, the reason that the US embassy wasn't moved to West Jerusalem is that the City of Jerusalem is a 'corpus seperatum', a separate body, neither Israel or Palestine. However, UN Security Council 2334, just proclaimed Palestine to be Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Clearly, the UN has dropped the Corpus Separatem concept. If East Jerusalem is Palestine, then West Jerusalem is clearly Israel. Therefore, the latest UN Security Council resolution should be used as the justification for moving the embassy to West Jerusalem within the Green Line.	20920273	Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should the U.S. Embassy Be Moved From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?

In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything.

bkw	9	0	I believe that moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would satisfy one of Mr. Trump's prime addictions. Namely, an addiction to chaos--and attention. Creating constant chaos in one way or another is how he's occupied the front pages worldwide--and has for months and no doubt will continue at least for the next four years. The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise. For example, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would have to be put out. And while Mr. Trump might call doing that being anti establishment. I would call it partly or wholly feeding an addiction.	20920262	Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should the U.S. Embassy Be Moved From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?

George	20	0	Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem is a way to tell the Palestinians that compromise is necessary if they want an independent state. Ever since 1947, the Arab world has rejected an independent Palestinian state because it has not been willing to recognize facts on the ground and make necessary concessions. Never before in history has there been an independence movement that rejected a state of its own because of a boundary dispute. There are close to 500,000 Israeli Jews living in Maale Adumim and other areas around Jerusalem. Israel cannot move them away kicking and screaming--as it did with settlers in Gaza. The Arab world has to stop making statements like the Three No's of Khartoum, which happened in 1967, and the refusal of the generous agreement that Clinton negotiated at Taba in the last moments of his presidency. Moving the Embassy to Jerusalem will tell the Palestinians that they have to compromise.	20917193	Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should the U.S. Embassy Be Moved From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?

Human interaction, the ability to deal with conflict, the necessity to adapt to people who are different from oneself, not responsive at the push of a button, and essential to the development of real social skills, becomes less and less for these kids--and for us adults, too. This lack manifests itself in a cut-off relationship with other people, indifference to neighbors, absence of the learning that generations have formerly passed on to the young--societal coldness and narcissism abound. And a terrible need to be heard, and seen, and cared for by real human beings is rampant among the young. This is Facebook's appeal; the young people are crying out, ""See me!

Scott	14	0	At this very moment I have access to a myriad to foreign language, mathematics, history, or programming courses that I can take in my free time and increase my knowledge of virtually any area of life I choose. Am I doing it? Absolutely not. Schooling involves so much more than simply logging on, watching a video or two and reading a few dozen pages of prepared materials. Learning involves interaction not only with students but with peers. By understanding where you stand among peers and listening to their interpretations of the subject, a person learns far more than the simple course material. They learn how to think, how to interact with peers and teachers, and to have some sense of the larger world. Home schooled children tend to test well but how many of them have gone on to really grow in a career? How many of them have a real understanding of what it means to be part of a group? Online resources are a wonderful supplement to traditional education but they will never hold a candle to the socialization that occurs in a classroom setting.	3647761	Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Can Young Students Learn From Online Classes?

Larry Figdill	23	0	Well stated. This is the essence of what teaching is about, beyond basic preparation of material for the whole class. It's hard to understand why this isn't more obvious to people, especially educated people who have benefited from great teachers in their career. While online tools have much to offer to complement the learning experience when used well, the only reason to see them as a substitute for real teaching is as a major (low quality) cost savings for the masses. And a homogenization of education to serve the needs of big corporate providers of educational materials.	3647415	Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Can Young Students Learn From Online Classes?

jzzy55	1	0	Just like other kind of learning, how it's designed and delivered and monitored and revised in response to inputs makes all the difference. Through an agency that provides tutors to school districts, I currently tutor children who are not making adequate progress. They use an online learning website that provides remedial content supposedly tailored to their individual needs but most of them hate it and they seem more like chimps typing than kids learning to me. I pull them off the computer every chance I can for small group learning with me leading the lesson, paper, and pencil.	3651968	Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Can Young Students Learn From Online Classes?

Laurie C	3	0	An incredible amount of time can be lost to technical issues with online classes (and with computers in classrooms). The discussion board doesn't open, links are broken, my browser won't open this or that page, the teacher can't find the file, we can't submit our work because the files are too big, students can't figure out how to make/open/save files, printers run out of ink, presentations disappear, and on and on and ON. One of these semesters I want to do research to see if using computers really does save time in the classroom. I suspect that it's not as much time as everyone seems to think.	3651071	Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Can Young Students Learn From Online Classes?

Emily	13	0	"Mr. Stager is against ""random"" teacher assignments, as well as the artificiality of keeping to schedules. Virtually all activities, and certainly jobs, require working within schedules and learning from those more skilled or knowledgeable. He envisions a utopia where professionalism is unnecessary. ""Everyone is a teacher and learner all of the time."" I suggest the next time Mr. Stager goes to a physician he might accept that ""everyone is a doctor and a patient all of the time."" He can then be treated by a doctor, an office manager or a fellow patient. Mr. Stager may have some good ideas about integrating computer learning and traditional teachers. Few people would object to that. Mainly, he seems to be advocating one more experiment in meeting students at the lowest common denominator of their attention span and undercutting the expertise and authority of the teacher.

On-line course learning does not require health or retirement plans, paid sick or vacation days or high paid administers to monitor learning.

hen3ry	1	0	When did having 75% of the students passing a course with a C or better become a good thing? I think that a 75% passing rate is not good. Did anyone work with these students to understand why only 75% of them passed? How much did the 75% who passed understand? Were they able to apply what they had been taught on line? I've taken online courses and they were not well designed, flexible, or conducive to having a discussion. This holds true for a set of courses I took 5 years ago and for several I've taken in the last year. Having an on line course available in conjunction with a live course would be great. Then the students can go over it to see what they've missed, ask questions if that doesn't help, and refer back to it when their notes aren't enough to recall the subject matter to mind. But exclusive reliance upon on line courses is foolish.	3651490	Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Can Young Students Learn From Online Classes?

Real Live Teacher	10	0	Perhaps the reason more students pass online courses is the content and standards are less rigorous than in a traditional classroom. In Texas, EVERY high school class is offered as an online option -- including art, speech, science with a lab, and (wait for it) physical education! As a teacher, I am disappointed that these courses replace meaningful interaction, critical thinking, and problem solving with worksheets and rote memorization. Maybe some online courses are engaging, but not the ones I have seen.

Q	1	0	"Sounds like what Stephanie Coontz calls ""two birds in a nest"" raising a family - parents and children in one household, no one else around the ideal for the 1950's - is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund. The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool?

tigermom	7	0	I have been successful at both obtaining tenure, academic prestige and children (late, admittedly). The advice I might offer aspiring young women is to find a younger man who is not particularly ambitious or career-focused and who loves kids and homelife. If you find such a man you can reap the same career benefits as your male colleagues who might marry a marriage-minded younger woman. If you want to be successful it is best to pass over the highly decorated, high maintenance males, unless you have decided that kids are not wanted. I also think success and power are attractive to both men and women and that a high status female can find younger partners relatively easily.	9422393	Wed Jul 10 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?

Ruchi	21	0	I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true.

Eugene	2	0	In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality.	9422820	Wed Jul 10 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?

We had 3 kids by the time I graduated from college (on time, at 22). We had two more by 28. True, my wife delayed finishing college; she got her degree in 1975 at age 27 instead of 1970.

George C	34	0	Maternal maturity is just as important as fertility when deciding when to have children. Very few women younger than age 25 have the maturity and necessary life experiences to become a mother at such a young age. At least in my opinion, the best time to become a Mom is somewhere between 25 and 35. The maturity is there, fertility is generally decent and chronic health problems have not yet set in.	9416175	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?

J	3	0	To me the most compelling reason to have children earlier rather than later, if possible, is the current make-up of our public schools. I have over 20 years teaching experience from 3rd grade through high school and GED programs. The correlation of older parents and the rise of autism and general growth of special education would be more than enough for me to hurry my decision to have children if in a committed relationship. The longer you wait, the higher your risks. If you think raising healthy children is challenging, imagine your day is 24/7 caring for a human being who will never be able to take care of him or herself, as you enter what should be the retirement/relaxing stage of life. It's no wonder we are blaming our schools and teachers for our educational failures, who wants to look in the mirror anymore?	9421381	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?

Ocean Blue	3	0	I agree with Robin. I had my babies at age 37 and 39, and they graduated college, and now I'm 61 and feel my age. They worry that I won't be able to take care of my grandchildren, whenever that happens. My mother was 40 when I was born, and never knew either child (she died at age 78). So don't postpone for a job, that's my advice. A job is just a job.

cindy	15	0	Having had my kids when I was 35 and 37 and having spent the day of my 50th birthday enduring the full on meltdown of a thirteen year old I came to the conclusion that women should have their only or last child when they are no older than 32. That way when you turn 50 your only or youngest child will be 18 and it can be a watershed moment for both of you. I said this to my dentist once as she was saying that she wasn't quite ready to have a baby yet, and I told her that in the early years it doesn't matter in terms of your energy for running around the playground if you are 35 or 40, it's later on when it matters and I felt like after the appt she ran out of the room to run home and get pregnant. But truly, even if you can get pregnant later and have healthy babies, it is brutal dealing with teens when you are going through your own changes.	9420423	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?

Karen R	18	0	So much of the debate focuses on when to give birth. Very little discussion addresses what happens next. I had my two children in my mid-thirties; quite the norm for professional women. Now I am in my fifties, dealing with teenagers who need me almost as much as an infant does-late nights, multiple crises, job interruptions, feeding, talking to, sturm und drang; as well as aging parents who also delayed childbirth till later in life. My husband's and my parents are older than most, more fragile, grappling with health issues, dementia, financial, housing, and end-of-life difficulties. They need every bit as much attention as our teenagers do. As do our careers, at peak. So which of these competing interests gets short- changed? There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish fervently I'd had my kids in my twenties. They'd be grown by now, and I could take at least one thing off my plate. I am tired. I'd love to be able to kick back and enjoy grand kids and nothing else.	9419321	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?	Women are waiting longer to start families.

Scarlet	9	0	One thing that many young women may not realize is just how hard IVF is. I was very lucky that my IVF was mostly covered by insurance and that I got pregnant after a single round. But I was surprised by the toll that fertility treatments took on me personally and professionally. The shear number of clinic visits made the process highly time-consuming, and the side effects of the medications interfered with my ability to be productive at work. So if it feels inconvenient to balance children with work at a younger age, keep in mind that the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you will need fertility procedures that are inconvenient and career-impacting in of themselves... and that's all before the baby actually arrives!	9419257	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?

CC	9	0	I agree with many of the posters: there is no one 'right' decision about the timing of parenting. That said, and based on my own experience, I would still encourage young women to have their babies on the younger side, if they have a choice. Late twenties seems optimal. I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself. Also, although I would have dearly loved a second child, I didn't think I had the energy for two. Parenting has been one of my life's greatest blessings, and I am grateful for the child I had. Nevertheless, having babies younger presents richer possibilities all the way around.	9419162	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?	Women are waiting longer to start families.

Julie S	12	0	All this talk of not having enough energy when you're older is nonsense. I had my son at 36 and am now 48. I have just as much energy as I did when I was 25. If you take care of yourself, energy shouldn't be a problem. Frankly, I spend more time with my son than most of the younger mothers in my neighborhood do with their kids. My husband and I aren't as eager to leave him with a babysitter so we can go out at night -- because we did that already in our twenties. In our forties, we are focused on our family.	9418937	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?	Women are waiting longer to start families.

Sheldon Bunin	10	0	My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children.	9417917	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?	Women are waiting longer to start families.

DH	10	0	"One of the saddest consequences of delaying children is the vanishing odds of seeing grandchildren, especially if there are several generations in a row that delayed, and the result is children that just do not have grandparents. I know such children, and they are sad. No amount of positive thinking and ""there are all kinds of families"" on the part of the parents can ease that pain. It's really disheartening listening to a kid tell you that, despite many uncles, aunts and cousins, they have ""a small family"", because they have no grandparents... How they wish they knew those grandparents, and wonder what they were like. Beyond covering the basics, money doesn't matter so much to kids, nor does status, nor material things nor travel, but what does matter to them is the people around them. There are all kinds of reasons to delay, but among the ""know what you're doing if you delay"" advice, I think the social circle a child is born into should take high priority - both in terms of the grandparents they may not have, and in terms of the parents who may not even live to see that child graduate from college..."	9417806	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?

Elena M.	14	0	The way I see it, it is better for people to have children later in life than sooner. From an evolutionary point of view, to be the child of parents that were in their 40s when they had you means that (a) both your parents survived until their 40s and (b) they were fertile too in their 40s. So, genetically, the offspring's chances to atteign - at least - that age and be also able to reproduce at that age are increased. Give it a couple of centuries of that policy and it could rise humanity's (at least in the western world) life expectancy by raising, among others, our reproductive expectancy.	9416238	Tue Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Women Delay Motherhood?

Brion Winston	1	0	Years ago ultimate was a destination for athletes from a variety of sports looking for something better. Apart from the fun of the sport, spirit of the game attracted athletes away from their roots in more conventional referee based sports. The sport has grown tremendously in the past 20 years and there are now legions of ultimate players the world over--competitive athletes--who identify as ultimate players. They practice hard, they travel to compete, they are committed to the sport through playing, coaching, and leadership. Having represented my university, my hometown, and my country at national and world championships, I am thrilled that American boys and girls now playing for their middle school or high school teams will soon be playing for USA on the greatest stage of all. Ultimate will restore and advance the Olympic spirit. And yes, observers to settle disputes that players cannot themselves immediately settle is the way to go.	15775042	Thu Aug 13 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Ultimate Frisbee at the Olympics?

The agents inside the building (where anyone who doesn't have a US or Canadian passport has to go) all carry pistols and are dressed in black, even people who are doing typing. I have heard these agents make disparaging comments, based on the appearance of people going into the US. I dread going across this border. I have crossed probably 20 or 30 borders of various countries, including Bulgaria, the former USSR, the former Yugoslavia, and so on. None of them were as depressing as the US border.

If the answer is that we must have borders, then those borders must be secure, or they might as well just open them to the world. Not an easy decision, but one which must be made. According to most estimates, there are 11 million undocumented immigrants in our country. Some estimates are even higher. If we have, so far, been unable to locate. identify and detain those 11 million people, how will we find and detain the next 11 million after this current group is processed and given what they have been seeking?

Yuval	4	0	I wonder if Mr. Krikorian has ever experienced any kind of affiliation to multiple groups. His view of dual citizenship is rather narrow minded. It limits citizenship to outward acts and ignores the true meaning of citizenry. A person is part of a country when he or she shares a culture with and is devoted to a country. Unlike marriage, devotion to a country is not an exclusive act. As the daughter of and American man and Israeli woman, I love both my countries equally, and would associate with both no matter my legal status.	6212507	Wed May 16 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?

PQuincy	5	0	Historically, the kind of sentimental nationalism expressed by Mr. Krikorian is a relatively recent phenomenon, and in its more potent forms -- as, for example, considering citizenship as intense as marriage, 'till death do us part' -- has often been a source of dangerous emotional politics and policy-making. Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others. Nationalism, and the intense 'marriage-like' sense of citizenship that it engenders, is a double-edged sword: valuable in moderation, dangerous when exaggerated, as Mr. Krikorian does.	6207800	Tue May 15 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?

Lisa H	16	0	Lots of Americans get second passports so they can work in Europe, etc. It's a net benefit for the U.S. because those citizens pay U.S. taxes while not using very many government services. They also free up U.S.-based jobs for other Americans. Do you really want hundreds of thousands of Americans coming back at the same time, all looking for U.S.-based jobs, because you took away their right to work in other countries?

This did not happen overnight. It was not done in the heat of any political movement. It came about because jurists is many nations realised that it was arbitrary to deprive migrants of a second citizenship but not those who acquired it at birth. Discussion of dual nationality is a distraction. In the current situation, there are better laws available: Deny the new Singaporean a visa to the US.

I have not done so but see no big deal in it, it would be more for sentimental purposes in my case. I love America but I have deep affection for Ireland. Having more than one passport does not mean a person does not love America, many naturalized citizens are more patriotic than native born ones. So while I see no big deal with Bachmann getting dual citizenship in general, due to her position and her constant patriotic drumbeating, it was rather myopic of her to do so at this time.

And now I have the one that welcome me, that gave me an oportunity for a better life, for safety and secutiy, for multidimendional growth.

Tom	1	0	Of course individuals with dual citizenship can be model citizens, that is until the policies of their two countries conflict. Those things don't normally happen for most people, unless they work for the government. My wife had dual citizenship, but when she began working for the U.S. Department of State she was asked to renounce the non-US one in order to get a security clearance. Back in my military career, it was common for foreign nationals to enlist, but hey did not get a Secret clearance until they became U.S. citizens and renounced their birth citizenship. That clearance was critical to becoming a non-commissioned officer or commissioned officer. Maybe the Congresswoman found out she would also lose her clearance if she kept here non-US citizenship, and that would put her seat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence in question. Just guessing there, but I wouldn't want anyone with dual citizenship - and therefore assumed dual allegiances - on any Congressional oversight committee, especially one with access to U.S. national security intelligence.

joe	1	0	I don't think she or her children should given up her Swiss Citizenship. God forbid, if there comes a time where her or her families health goes south, she would at least have an alternative, than to be at the mercy of the American Health insurance system that will turn her away, if her claim hurts their bottom line. While she may have campaigned against Obama/Romney care and helped watered it down, that its no where close to what it could have been, I would really relish her hypocrisy to be thrown into the face of those idiot supporters who rallied to her side against this administrations health care reform. While her family can take advantage of another countries socialist system, her supporters are stuck with crippling debt or the prospect of being denied life by the insurance companies.	6211707	Wed May 16 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?

Skip Conrad	1	0	"""Nineteen out of the top 20 source countries for immigrants now allow their citizens to maintain the status even as they naturalize in the United States.""/i> Yes, but the US doesn't permit it. In order to naturize here, you must renounce any other citizenship you have. This is done is a sworn solemn Oath of Allegiance. Failure to do this is an act of perjury. And it makes sense, because otherwise you would not care about the country, knowing that have a place you can split to. There's a whole bunch who hold Israeli citizenship such as Michael Cherkoff, Ram Emmanuel, Richard Pearle, Paul Wolfawitz. And of course, Arnawld Schwarzenegger is an Austrian citizen.

Ladislav Nemec	4	0	Dual citizenship can be problem only during a declared war between the two countries. Declared wars (never mind our Constitution) are a thing of the past. Consequently, dual citizenship is not even a minor problem. I do not think we plan to declare war on anyone anytime soon. The last country that declared war on us was the one depicted in the Mouse that Roared (was this the title of a movie decades ago?) and it achieved what it was looking for: kind of Marshall plan financed by us. In other words, the whole issue is a joke.	6210349	Tue May 15 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?	Should dual citizenship be allowed?

You know, the old USSR had the same additude: ""We're the best place in the world, and to prove it, we're going to force you to stay here."" No thanks.

Gerry	13	0	I hold dual citizenship as do two of my three American born children. One has a UK issued EU passport and the other an Irish one. Advantages ? Absolutely, not only for them but also for their children. And as for my motive in taking out US citizenship after 37 years here on a green card - very simple. I was trapped in Europe 9/11 and had an overwhelming need to go home, home being the US. That singular event and ensuing xenophobia clarified for me that the US was indeed my home, that I wanted to vote. On a lighter note, producing that EU passport at the dreaded Heathrow Airport a couple of weeks ago smoothed passage through that bottleneck! For my children, my dream is that they retain a link to their heritage from both sides of the pond, that they are citizens of the world, good ones at that.	6209074	Tue May 15 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?

Jan	9	0	Dual citizenship is a sign of the times, and a good one. It means people can reach beyond borders, live with others of a different culture in peace and increase the understanding between the world's cultures, religions etc. The notion that people should be beholden to a country is old-fashioned. A country in the end is just a piece of land between borders. What matters - and what keeps a country viable - are the values a country stands for. No piece of paper is going to change someone's allegiance in times of peace or war. Even Americans, when fighting in wars, always herald higher goals than mere defense of their country. It's about freedom, human rights and democracy. Those are values shares by the citizens of most countries in the world.	6208131	Tue May 15 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?

Luce	6	0	Dual citizens are a big asset to any country, but especially to the US. Since US tax laws require all citizens (and also green-card holders) to report all their worldwide income and economic activity to the IRS every year, and pay US tax on any otherwise non-taxed items, any dual citizen, or green-card holder, who does not renounce his citizenship or green card, is actually a very dedicated and valuable citizen for the US to hold on to. Since the level of corruption available to taxpayers overseas is generally very much wider than in the US, dual citizens are exhibiting a very big commitment to the US when they hold onto their dual citizenship.	6207021	Tue May 15 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?

It's not that scary - in fact, it's wonderful, as are the people who live in it! Stop being paranoid about the rest of the world.

Neale Adams	1	0	"So pervasive must be the assumption that loyal (American) nationalism is a good thing, that none of the commentators mentioned the negative aspects of the nation state. I tend to agree with Orwell: "" A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist - that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating - but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations."" By refusing exclusive loyalty to one nation, the dual nationalist waters down excessive nationalism - which, in its extreme form, can easily slide into fascism. With two or more perspectives, the dual nationalist can more easily see the strengths - and the flaws - within the country in which he or she is residing. The dual nationalist, in particular, realizes that most claims of American exceptionalism are baseless."	6213124	Wed May 16 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?

Great White North Guy	2	0	While it is true that the USA does not actively discourage dual citizenship, it does so by taxing its citizens who are making their lives abroad based on citizenship rather than country of permanent residence. Trust me, this is discouraging dual citizenship and encouraging people to take on another and drop their US citizenship. Many of you will say that this is the cost of membership!! It just happens that after living in several other countries, many of us realize that the USA is not a club we want to be part of. So yes, we give up our citizenship. Good riddance you might say? Fine, but who do you think is loosing the most, the skilled expat workers and professionals who make a conscious decision to abandon their citizenship and are in demand around the word or the US? As an aside, the USA is only one of two countries in the world to double tax its non-resident citizens... the other is Eretrya, a small country in the horn of Africa ruled by one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world.	6211379	Wed May 16 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Can Dual Citizens Be Good Americans?

This writer, well intentioned but so blinded by his own belief system, has to admit that even if 1% of the 1,000,000 'refugees' are radicals or dangerous than that is 1,000 people. Rather than bring in large numbers of refugees, the west should build modern camps in the middle east where these individuals can be protected from war, and when Syria is more stable then they can return home.

ann	14	0	Terrorism and immigration have become linked. Western countries welcome legal immigrants based on our tolerance of other religions and cultures. It is ironic that France has accepted countless numbers of Moslems from North Africa and the Mid- East, some of whom turn out, themselves, to be intolerant. No matter what immigrants' backgrounds are, they have to understand that the reason they have been allowed into their host country, in the first place, is that it is tolerant, and that it expects them to be so, too. This includes putting up with criticism of one's behavior, just as Charlie Hebdo made fun of what some Moslems were doing. (It does not include criticizing people for who they are.) Immigrants who will not teach tolerance to their children should be asked to leave. This should include community leaders and anyone who tries to teach/ preach intolerance to others.	16684150	Mon Nov 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Europe Shun Refugees After the Paris Attacks?

Oakbranch	65	0	The issue is not whether refugees are good people or not -- rather the concern should be that those fleeing war in Syria should not all be going to Europe. A greater effort needs to be made to keep them in the Middle East, in nations closer to their home, if not indeed in their own country. THe solution to turbulence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or any other nation, is not that these nation's whole populations go to Europe. No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in. No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants. Nations can and should have workable policies on immigration, capable of being followed and enforced. THis is an issue quite separate from that of terrorism, and one that has been a major political issue in the US for decades already.	16680525	Mon Nov 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Europe Shun Refugees After the Paris Attacks?

Kennedy6500	14	0	The world is a mean, cold, hard, ugly place. A soveriegn nation's highest call is to protect its citizens. Allowing tens of thousands of random refugees asylum makes a nation less secure. A nation must take care of its own first. Only then can it help outsiders. Ideally, those two objectives will not clash. In a time of war, however, they are in direct conflict. Europe needs to not only allow zero new refugees in, but it needs to cancel all current visas and issue no new visas to citizens from the Middle East. When this war is over, when Islam in the Middle East finally undoes its extremist rigging, then immigration and visas may begin again. After all, in 1943, we weren't taking in any German or Japanese refugees, or allowing them to come in on student or work visas. Every nation in the Middle East, with the possible exception of Jordan, is a a grave enemy to values and security of the West. This is a war now. We must act on a war footing.	16685544	Mon Nov 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Europe Shun Refugees After the Paris Attacks?

Mytwocents	20	0	The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue, (the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand. The author's view can't be more nearsighted: the European's nationals he talks about are yesterday's ME migrants; and today's ME migrants bring tomorrow's 'homegrown' terrorists, dis-enfrenchised. The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps.	16684416	Mon Nov 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Europe Shun Refugees After the Paris Attacks?

Peter C	22	0	Should Europe shun Muslim refugees? Yes, but not only because of what happened in Paris! As much as these refugees are in a really bad situation - people seem to forget that there is already a huge problem in Europe with Muslim immigrants. For different reasons, these immigrants have not integrated into society, refuse to obey local laws and as a group are very hateful and intolerant towards others. You can either call me a racist or a realist - the facts are very hard to ignore. Anyone who thinks that these refugees will be different from those Muslims already in Europe is dreaming - allowing all these immigrants in will only worsen the existing situation in Europe.

Rod Martin	7	0	Europeans are being told to continue supporting mass unchecked migration into their countries because the people coming, are fleeing the same type of terrorist attacks that some who are migrating, are now bringing into Europe....That's a paradox! Along the same nonsensical strategy, it's akin to telling Europeans to support mass unchecked migration into their countries from those fleeing the deadly Ebola virus. Unfortunately, radicalized Islamist's are akin to a virus that spreads and kills those who do not prescribe to their Ideology. For non Muslim Europeans there is no immunity, and the Paris attacks are likley just the beginning of this self imported virus.	16685520	Mon Nov 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Europe Shun Refugees After the Paris Attacks?

James	8	0	Seems a bit silly, perhaps tongue in cheek. How to force people to fight who don't want to fight? Bottom line is that none of the people appearing in Europe and demanding asylum are refugees, since the Syrians all had places of refuge (Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.) and left those places of refuge as economic migrants (preferring German welfare to Turkish welfare, as would any rational human being). As for the non-Syrians, including various draft dodgers, they were not even refugees to start with.	16685682	Mon Nov 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Europe Shun Refugees After the Paris Attacks?

Brian	3	0	There is a simple reason that the EU should restrict the number of refugees, and it is the xenophobia of Europeans. I just don't think it is possible for Europe to absorb a large number of poor, dispossessed immigrants from a politically volatile part of the world without it leading inexorably to a rise in nationalism, and ethnic violence. This is not to say that Europe could not benefit greatly from an influx of immigrants ... it could. And it is not to say that Syrian refugees represent an outsized threat ... they probably don't. But as ISIS knows very well, all it takes is a few well-placed terrorist attacks to stoke the latent tribalism that lives just under the civilized veneer of Europe.	16685175	Mon Nov 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Europe Shun Refugees After the Paris Attacks?

TeamVenture	1	0	When I went to college a decade ago, the priced i paid for a single dorm room was less than a shared off-campus room. I did live in an older building with communal bathrooms, my room was tiny with a bed, desk, dresser and a small closet. Not only that, it gave my parents peace of mind that people in my building were enrolled students, opposite gender friends aren't supposed to stay overnight and an RA on every floor. At night if I needed to go somewhere on campus and felt unsafe, I could call the university for someone to walk with me. Obviously it you cannot afford to live outside of your home, that's that but for people to claim off campus housing is cheaper and everyone does it is plain wrong.	9860673	Sat Aug 31 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Students Live on Campus or Off?

Lisa	1	0	Why no mention of the great communal living alternative, near-campus co-op housing? All the benefits of living in groups (diverse population and late night discussions included) and lower costs thanks to the residents taking on much of the upkeep of the building, cooking of the communal meals, etc. There are small co-op houses of under 20 and large ones with closer to 200 students. The best are part of co-op systems where the houses can benefit from economies of scale, residents are actually owners during their time at the house, and afford to hire some professional staff -- but students can have a good experience even with less-formalized independent group houses that are run co-operatively though they may technically be rental houses.	9859903	Fri Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Students Live on Campus or Off?

tejanarusa	1	0	I agree wholeheartedly. It's true that I was in college a long time ago, but living in a dorm was mostly a great experience. And the parts that weren't great were good for my maturing process. As Dr. Shalala said, there's community in a dorm; I was a shy girl, but made friends easily in the dorm atmosphere. I would have been lonely off-campusin an apartment. Also, cooking, cleaning, shopping for food take time, time that I was able to devote to studying. Especially when I came back as a 26-yr old to live in a graduate dorm for a year, it was a huge relief to let someone else cook, and just show up to eat. And again, I made new friends, people I'd never have met had I lived in an apartment.	9853997	Fri Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Students Live on Campus or Off?

The vast majority of Americans live within commuting distance of universities. People are saddling themselves with ridiculous amounts of debt in pursuit of a fantasy. They should stay home, work and save during the summer and graduate debt-free.	9863387	Tue Sep 03 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Students Live on Campus or Off?

Amena Chaudhry	3	0	You're missing the point, dear. In the US, when Muslim women who are CHOOSING to cover with a hijab are being targeted with hate and violence, covering in solidarity supports their right to cover. This supports their right to own their hair. In no way can this even slightly support poisoning little girls.	17193020	Tue Jan 12 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?

Earthling	18	0	I recall when 15 Muslim girls were burned to death in a fire in their school in Mecca. Saudi religious police (the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice) forced schoolgirls back into a blazing building because they were not wearing Islamic headscarves and black robes. This covering of Muslim women is an anachronistic, misogynistic relic of a Bronze Age patriarchal religion, one as idiotic and woman-hating as the other monotheistic patriarchal belief systems. A pox on all of them.	17145000	Thu Jan 07 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?	Some will wear a headscarf in solidarity with Muslim women.

Pamela	30	0	There are increasing numbers of Muslims in my neighborhood, and the sight of some of the women in a hijab and even in burqas inspires anger and sorrow for them; to me, they are diminished, nullified, and erased under these garments. That said, it is unclear to me with what aspect of Muslim womanhood Larycia Hawkins was in solidarity when she donned a headscarf a few weeks ago: their status as women? their right to wear the scarf? When the NYT posted the article about Ms. Hawkins, it said she had put on the scarf to show solidarity with Muslims, not just with Muslim women.	17140705	Wed Jan 06 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?

Dreamer	5	0	If my coreligionists, let's say religion XYZ, was seen everyday, everywhere, as perpetrators of massacres and other inhuman brutality, and here in the US I went about displaying all the outward signs that I am proud of my religion no matter what, it is all but natural and logical that other people not belonging to my religion, XYZ, will look askance at me, even possibly hate me and harm me. This is not rocket science - why do the hijab-wearers find it so difficult to understand? I have often seen immigrant women, possibly from Ghana, Nigeria, etc., go about in very colorful non-western dresses and I almost always admire them. And I believe most people admire these colorfully-dressed people even though they are obviously non-Caucasian immigrants from Africa. And the reason is simple: when we see these different-looking people, we do not immediately associate them with some sub-human brutes in other parts of the world. Unfortunately, the hijab makes most of us do exactly that, notwithstanding what the Koran says or does not say about the almighty requiring the women to wear it as symbol of their piety.	17144931	Thu Jan 07 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?

elizabeth renant	64	0	"The only solidarity the hijab shows is with that most ancient of patriarchal male control strategies, shifting the burden of morality, family and male honor, etc., onto the shoulders of female modesty. It is no different from Orthodox Jewish married women having to cover their hair, or the in the Middle Ages married women in Europe were expected to wear a coif to cover their hair, and is nakedly an attempt to confine women's sexual nature in as small a space as possible. It stands in relationship to footbinding and to female genital mutilation, albeit at another point on the bellcurve of control of women and control of female sexuality. If you insist on sacrificing yourself on this altar to show ethnic solidarity, don't be surprised when people conclude that Islam is still stuck in the past. As Rhett Butler once famously said to Scarlett in ""Gone with the Wind"" when she refused to abandon black mourning clothes for a husband she not only didn't love, but despised, ""How closely women clutch the chains that bind them!""

Kate	12	0	Several years ago when I was working with a Christian NGO in a largely Muslim area of Northern Kenya I asked a female colleague why she covered her head completely in the same way as Muslim women. She was surprised at my question and responded that it was a sign that she was a mature married woman. This gave me a new perspective on a symbol I had always seen as a sign of strict adherence to Islam. I later watched an interview with a young woman barber in Indonesia, where most Muslims are highly tolerant of other faiths (five are officially recognized by the government) and virtually all Muslim women wear the local style of hijab. When she was asked how she reconciled her profession with Muslim restrictions on contact with men, she replied in a matter of fact way that if she followed this rule she wouldn't be able to work and support her small daughter, and that wouldn't be good for anyone. One can only hope for a world where common sense prevails over the cultural loadings attached to these symbolic acts.	17139799	Wed Jan 06 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?

By wearing my head scarf in this public space we share, I declare first and foremost that I am a Muslim, and that I am different from you.""

DD	26	0	Muddled thinking here. Muslims so often point out with alacrity that specific clothing (i.e., covering) is not defined in the Koran, yet here we are exposed to a Islamocentric defense of rules of female dress that are designed to restrict a woman's freedom. These public displays of religion, from yamakas to burkhas are offensive to those who hate religious tyranny, but, alas, must be tolerated. But don't tell me it's done for feminist reasons. There's nothing feminist at all about the three Abrahamic religions, which, together with their oppression of women, are used to justify so much violence today.	17141178	Wed Jan 06 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?

Reader	34	0	This is a ridiculous and absurd bastardization of the idea of 'feminism'. In a feat of intellectual gymnastics, this argument tragically turns feminism on its [covered] head. Feminism is about women's economic, cultural, personal, social, sexual, and reproductive freedom. It's about equality to males in every sphere of life. Body/head covering and female genital mutilation are central features of a patriarchal and misogynistic faith, whose arm extends to the state in much of the world. Please pick a new word. Religious head covering is the very antithesis of feminism.	17140455	Wed Jan 06 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?

Northstar5	66	0	Nonsense. The hijab, long cloak-like garments, and their more extreme cousin, the burka, are inherently anti-woman. Their entire purpose is to shame, to make the body itself sinful, teach women that their very physicality is a problem.

NGINSING	19	0	Totally agree with the writer. As a woman's hair is considered sexually arousing, by covering her hair, the woman is essentially taking on the responsibility that she is the CAUSE of a man's sexual thoughts and actions and she is the one who cause him to 'sin'. This eventually leads to the common perception that 'she asked for it'. For decades, women in the west has fought and is still fighting hard to dispel such perceptions. So for the non muslim women who are considering putting on the hijab, please think of its significance. The hijab is not a mere fashion statement or a 'hip' head wear. There are many other ways to show support against Islamophobia.	17149369	Thu Jan 07 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?

The Quran says that married women should be discrete towards other men , it never said women should be covered from head to toes. We know the rules were set up to dominate women in Muslim countries , the same way other rules were set up in Christian countries to keep women at the lower end of society .

Because people wear crosses, yammuka or sarees covering their head with a dot on the forehead. The only problem I have is with the face being covered. If you can see my face, should'nt you be showing your face to me, too.

Peggy	96	0	I hope that Muslim women understand the symbolic meaning of covering one's hair before doing so. It objectifies women's hair (or face when it comes to wearing a burka). It asserts that men's sexual desires are uncontrollable and that women have to take responsibility for men remaining in control of themselves. Is that fair? It also degrades men. Why should women have to hide their hair or themselves completely (in the case of a burka) so that men can walk free.	17138267	Wed Jan 06 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do Non-Muslims Help or Hurt Women by Wearing Hijabs?

ABCSloop	3	0	"In James 2:14-26 Paul writes: ""What good is it... if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, ""Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,"" but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead... Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds... You believe that there is one God. Good!

gadfly2000	10	0	Shame on you. It's so easy to second-guess other people's good work when you're sitting on your... laurels. I grew up in Kolkata in the 80s. Mother Teresa and her missionaries were active, and made a real difference in the slums in the central and northern parts of the city. More importantly, she drew attention to the plight of the homeless and dying in the city. I get that this makes some Bengali intellectuals, such as Aroup Chatterjee, uncomfortable. So what? So her priorities didn't agree with yours. Since when did your priorities become the yardstick for sainthood?	18005097	Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should Mother Teresa Be Canonized?

Who on earth would venerate dictators, corrupt financiers and evil bishops? Only the Catholic Church! Next they will be canonizing Scalia.

But for an institution that gives half hearted apologies, excuses, and outright lies, not to mention legal maneuverings to avoid criminal action, for years involving the sexual abuse of children, then shuffles its biggest criminal Bernard Law to a cushy job in Rome to avoid prosecution. Oh well. If Jesus would behave this way then I guess I know nothing of his life. For Catholics who gleefully go along with this stuff, let's not judge too harshly the extremist Muslims.

Faith in a heaven proves nothing, given that even Jesus hasn't returned from that alleged place as promised. But to state that someone is in heaven goes beyond faith to silliness. To honor someone for service makes a great deal of sense. To proclaim that someone is in heaven, with no proof whatsoever, boggles the mind. The problems of today's world again are centered around that hate of others that most religions preach and that includes the Church, Islam, Jehovahs witnesses, evangelical Christians...and on and on. The mere fact that the major religions exist today means only one thing... that what mom and dad believe is passed down without much question, study, etc. That's all it means....""mom and dad did it...so will I.""

Andrew Kahr	1	0	Suppose it is the case that: (1) She believed that a person who becomes a Christian and goes through the prescribed rites will go to Heaven--otherwise, to Hell. (That's not what Pope Francis says he believes, but so what? She died before his innovations.) (2) She believed that being in Heaven is better than being alive, so if someone is allowed to die sooner, we're doing him a favor. (3) The sick poor she dealt with got no worse medical or other care from her than they would have gotten had she not been there. That's what a lot of 19th century Christian missionaries, certainly including Protestants, thought. If those three assumptions are correct, I think it is right for the Church to make her a saint. Non-Catholics can complain, but it's got nothing to do with them.	18005992	Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should Mother Teresa Be Canonized?

Inveterate	1	0	The debate seems limited to certain medical websites. What really gives good options is the reading of research articles themselves. Yes, it requires more education and some knowledge of anatomy, neurology, etc. But those who can do it, can find doctors and researchers willing to treat them. And they can manage their problems much better than if they relied on a single doctor. And don't forget, the US is almost the last resort for medical advice. Big pharma here is unfettered and excludes supplements and unpatentable drugs. Much research is going on elsewhere in the world. You must read those articles, and act accordingly.

Porphyry	1	0	As a prescriber, one of my most common experiences is patients' declining to take a prescribed medication because they look up the side effects and get scared.

Itzajob	2	0	Patients consult the internet out of desperation, because they've gotten no help from doctors who spend 5 minutes with them before moving on to the next patient. I've seen it over and over in my own family: A parent with late onset Type 1 diabetes who spent 2 years in the ER with glucose readings well over 400, because doctors would not acknowledge that a thin, active 68-year old might possibly have Type 1 requiring insulin instead of Type 2. A sibling with thyroid disease and a huge goiter whose doctor dismissed it until it finally became toxic. Another with a chronically ruptured appendix who kept being sent home from the ER with ludicrous diagnoses, until it finally became septic, resulting in 2 weeks in the ICU. We diagnosed all these conditions ourselves, before the doctors did. It actually didn't get us any help, because doctors really don't like being challenged. But when your loved one is dying before your eyes and getting no help, what else are you supposed to do?	19639561	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Nora	12	0	I would imagine that there are also plenty of instances in which a little bit of Internet research winds up improving a person's condition or even saving a life. Twenty years ago when my dad got a weird spot on his arm, for example, he ignored it for months before being diagnosed with melanoma. Nowadays, a quick Google Image search on my mom's part could have convinced him to go much earlier. Doctors deal with people's health all day long and know a lot, but patients and their loved ones are the experts on what is normal for them and are the ones who know when something just doesn't seem right. It would be a shame if a patient failed to ask a question or do any research at all when presented with a diagnosis for fear of injuring his or her doctor's ego.	19637475	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Patricia	33	0	My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet.	19634291	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

TechMaven	20	0	I wish my physician had consulted Dr. Google before prescribing a fluoroquinolone to me a year ago for a simple mosquito bite that develped a minor infection. He might have discovered that the FDA advises against prescribing these drugs for common illnesses due to serious side effects affecting tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system causing permanent disability. In fact, within an hour of taking one pill, my knees became numb. I discontinued the drug but the numbness has not gone away. The tools available through allopathic Western medicine are flawed at best. Most of our drugs have questionable value and all have side effects. Treatments manage symptoms without offering cures. They keep patients in treatment for decades. Most doctors are hampered from freely applying even those flawed tools by the strictures of insurance companies and practices which limit office visits to 15 minutes. It's medicine practiced by accountants, not doctors. And unfortunately, many doctors are simply not very good. So IMHO, Dr. Google deserves a place in the exam room.	19632521	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Ingrid	28	0	Doctors, in my numerous recent experiences caring for myself and my family, don't often spend much time talking with patients, so I've had to look things up online. I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets.	19631678	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Mainer	10	0	I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies.	19631099	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

It has helped me determine that I didn't need treatment for subconjunctival hemorrhage, but that my daughter probably had pneumonia after a serious viral infection, and needed treatment. Using a website to substitute for knowledge that takes a physician a minimum of ten years to acquire is nuts. Using a website to gain general information is not.

B	2	0	No, legitimate health sites do not recommend self treatment for anything other than self-limiting conditions - conditions that will go away without professional care. Common colds are examples, and legitimate sites will give you symptoms to help tell the difference between a cold and a more serious condition and will invariably say if these symptoms do not go away in a week or so, consult a doctor. We should not discourage use of legitimate health sites. What we should do is to encourage medical experts to review, monitor and give feedback to sites and tell consumers which are the best ones.	19647276	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

David Gottfried	4	0	I sincerely believe that I would have died many years ago had I not done my own homework, researched my doctors' counsel, and found their advice wanting. Just remember: In most cases, a doctor's compensation is based, essentially, on just one variable: The quality of forms submitted to third party payors, such as Blue Cross or Medicare. If the form looks alright, the doctor is paid, Whether you live, die, get better, don't get better or drop dead five minutes after you have exited the doctor's plush arrogant office, is really quite besides the point. Patients: Don't be so patient.	19641659	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

eld	2	0	While I understand what the article is saying, at the same time it does a disservice to being able to stay informed about our personal health care. We are all not able to distinguish true medical research from personal stories, true, but if at the very least it starts a conversation between us and our medical provider that's a good thing. Any doctor not willing to discuss what I have read or learned, including the ability to admit not having too much knowledge about some particulars but willing to find out or point me in a good direction, are blessed with me finding one who will. It's my body, I am adamant about being involved in what happens to it.	19641055	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Nobody	2	0	As a cancer survivor (14 years in remission after an aggressive lymphoma treated with Chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy) I am happy to say that I made very extensive use of the Google during my treatment. It obviously doesn't replace or 'outrank' my specialists, but I found it was a big help in educating me and filling in background info on my situation and the treatment options that were being recommended. I believe researching options online helped me to ask better questions and ultimately made me a lot more comfortable with the treatment plan my doctors recommended. In most cases, the information I found online agreed with what the docs were telling me. I found that to be very comforting because I didn't just feel like I was taking everything the docs said on blind faith and at face value. In at least 2 cases, the questions I asked did lead to changes in my treatment plan.	19640659	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Ben	3	0	I agree with others that patient views are not represented here. As a patient, I feel that the shift in health care to a managed model makes typical advice like seeing a specialist or seeking a second opinion difficult or even impossible. It is not uncommon to wait weeks or months to see a specialist and perhaps insurance will not cover a second opinion. It is well and good to advise patients to engage closely with their medical care, but when it is so difficult to see a doctor at all, and then be afforded only a few minutes when you do see them, I can understand why patients might seek out advice elsewhere. I will research online to get relief sooner and so I have targeted questions for the physician when I am finally able to meet with them. This makes a cumbersome process much more productive in my experience.	19639051	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Dr. Carl West	16	0	I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two years. Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects.	19638362	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Josh Hill	15	0	I suppose that can happen, but honestly, I use these sites for much more mundane purposes, e.g., to determine whether I should see the doctor, find a home treatment for a minor ill, or learn more about something that a doctor didn't have time to explain. Occasionally, I have found a diagnosis that the doctor missed, and passed it on. But I think that most people get in trouble with these sites because they don't stick to the more reputable ones or try to play doctor without the knowledge and experience to do so.	19630660	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

For example, I recently had a number of blood tests run and the results emailed to me. I have no idea what the results mean and emailed my doctor to ask what behavioural changes I would need to make to be healthier. I was told that my results indicate that I am health and to eat a low GI diet. I would have appreciated more time to make sure I understand what the results mean versus feeling like I got brushed off.

India	5	0	When my husband was diagnosed with late stage, very aggressive prostate cancer 13 years ago, I did turn to the internet. I went to respected, reliable web sites. I got enough knowledge from them to help us choose a urologist as at least 2 of the 4 we interviewed, told us information that was just plain incorrect. They tried to sugar coat his disease when we needed facts. Finally, we found a doctor who listened to us and then told us what we needed to know. I basically avoid forums as they are full of the anecdotal gibberish of people who often are very uneducated but very opinionated. The only thing I ever learned on them was about a specialists at Columbia Presbyterian (we did see him) and how to travel with my percussion vest on small planes. My pulmonologist appreciates that I do know a great deal about my disease and that I know my body very well. I appreciate that he knows a great deal more about medicine than I do. Together, we keep me in pretty decent shape.	19639960	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

connie zuckerman	3	0	The search for information on the internet about illness and symptoms may not only yield interesting info for the patient, but for the physician as well. I recently had an appointment with my physician and he began our encounter by asking me what I found when I googled my symptoms. I realized that this was brilliant on his part- not only did it give me the opportunity to run by him all of the fears I had concerning my symptoms but it also revealed to him symptoms and concerns I had that I might never have otherwise been raised during a more usual encounter.

Vanessa	2	0	I am a doctor and am at a distinct advantage in terms of understanding what my doctor is trying to tell me when I am a patient. I think that sometimes we, those of us who diagnose and treat, forget the kind of health literacy advantage we have when explaining diagnoses and conditions to our patients and forget that the routine diagnosis for us is not so routine for the patient being diagnosed. So, while Dr. Google and his message boards are not a substitute for my medical education, experience and expertise (and must always come with that disclaimer), he does serve a role in terms of patient education and helping one to cope that I may not be able to provide given the time limitations of my job.	19639089	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Grace Brophy	3	0	When I was diagnosed with HER2 breast cancer, I did considerable research on the internet, most of it highly technical articles on HER2. I was lucky to have an oncologist who respected me and my knowledge and worked with me to define my treatment. I wouldn't go to a doctor who shows contempt for patients who do their own research. As many have noted doctors are neither gods nor all knowing, and I doubt any oncologist, even a specialist in breast cancer, has time to read well more than 700 technical articles on HER2 cancer. How would they find the time? It's ten years now since my surgery and I will be forever thankful for finding a doctor who had a true interest in his patients and was able to leave his ego out of the examination room. If you happen to read this, thanks Dr. Volm.	19638956	Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

Tom	14	0	Correct. Considering the general scientific illiteracy of the public, the result is not surprising that people would search for other sources (other than their own doctor). Considering that webmd and the mayo lead in the searches, is it a problem with the veracity of the website information or the patient's understanding of the information? I would posit that a more informed patient is a better patient and the doctor's place is to evaluate the patient's understanding of the problem. If the patient received and correctly understood the information from the internet, doesn't that give the doctor more time to get on with treatment rather than take the time to explain the basics to the patient?	19632726	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Medical Websites Healthful?

JPL	1	0	"When I was in 6th grade, my teacher asked the class to identify the most important thing to learn in school. There were lots of suggestions - reading, math, history, how to write well, spelling, etc. It wasn't until someone said ""to learn how to learn"" that she was satisfied with the answer. I've never forgotten that lesson. One can quickly gather a lot of information on the internet, and I consider that to be a tremendous advance. But it takes critical thinking skills to turn that information into knowledge, to assess and weigh evidence, to draw well-reasoned conclusions and to present them persuasively. A well constructed research paper assignment can help hone those skills."	4441037	Thu Sep 01 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

Aware and Scared	25	0	I cannot remember a time when all the invited essays on a Room for Debate, by and large, agreed with each other. These times are lauded as the Age of Information. But the simple reality missing from the premise of this debate is having ACCESS to information is not the same as being able to USE information. A research paper, at its core, requires that information be: > obtained; > analyzed; then > utilized. How could this EVER become obsolete? Yes, it is demoralizing that too many students believe that Google relieves them of any obligation to actually acquire skills of investigation, evaluation, and synthesis or that experts like librarians are obsolete. However, when a graduate program's provides a list of companion articles for courses and then the library provides one-click access to each and every article, they both are complicit in contributing to their own obsolescence.	4425948	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

Kernyl	8	0	Even an essay detailing a student's opinion on something must be well informed and researched. Besides being a tool for learning more in depth about a subject, a research paper teaches critical thinking skills. A good student should read and review relevant material if they are going to voice an opinion. Sure the internet makes it a bit easier to find information, but it is a double edged sword. Students must learn how to sort good sources from poor sources. They must learn to look at a writers or organizations credentials and decide if it is a qualified source. They need to ask questions about whether they think the writer's research or reporting is itself based on good evidence or whether their study was conducted well. There are plenty of resources available on the internet, but many would not be considered reliable by my professors at least. (For example, Wikipedia. I reference it in everyday life all the time for general information, but never for a research paper)	4427835	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

jay fraser	14	0	The research paper is integral to college work. It's the vehicle through which students are taught to gather and evaluate serious sources and THEN create a convincing argument or thesis to prove/demonstrate. But, teaching the process successfully requires close attention from the teacher. In teaching, I set up the process by requiring interim reports at each stage: bibliography, creation of the thesis; first draft, finished draft. At each stage, I graded and criticized. Obviously, most institutions do not afford the amount of time this takes so the process gets mangled. And most English professors avoid teaching freshman English/comp so the course does not get the senior attention it deserves. A pity, because the research paper is key in teaching the student how to do college work and how to write serious papers.	4427401	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

Barbara Saunders	3	0	Google and Wikipedia may allow incompetent researchers to produce a flurry of activity and a work product that looks like a substitute for research. However, Google and Wikipedia are not the root cause of bad research or students who don't know how to research. A student who understands the fundamental principles of research will use various tools appropriately to reach project goals. One thing that strikes me: some people who object to the use of online tools seem to have a hazing agenda. In my opinion, if a student researches well without the long nights in the stacks, or uses intelligent online tools and techniques to narrow down the reading list, that is a good thing.	4428222	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

As Matt, # 9, said, the problems described by Mr. Bauerlein would not occur with a carefully designed assignment.

Marcus Patterson	2	0	I think that with the vast amount of resources available on the internet, it's vital that we continue to assign research papers. But, with the assigning of research papers, teachers and professors must ensure that they are teaching the proper critical reading and analytical skills with which to evaluate and utilise these resources. Given the extremely complex world in which we live, the ability to reason critically and vigorously couldn't be stressed enough. Assigning essays and the research paper would enable students to work with seeming volumes of sometimes contrasting information, come to a view, defend that view, and reconcile that view with differing ones - that's what we do everyday, and the ability to do it well is necessary to maintain a free-thinking, socially- and environmentally-responsible, democratic society.	4427718	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

edgar80	3	0	As a high school teacher of English for the past thirty five years, I believe we still need to teach students to have ideas that are supported with factual information. Notice, I said factual information. It is sad in our world today when the supporters of finding real information, librarians, have been systematically cut from school budgets. Many librarians have crossed the bridge to finding legitimate information in the digital world as well as printed materials. Only, now that we need verification of information, do we find a shortage of personnel who can teach that skill.	4427039	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

JJ	8	0	I agree unreservedly. There is nothing better than a research paper to uncover superficial uncritical thinking. Students must learn to digest, isolate and critically (!) evaluate the relevant information and then apply it to achieve the objective of their research topic lest the result will be unusable garbage. There is far too much misinformation out there in cyberspace as is. It is stunning how our society in a few short years has descended to a level on which we seriously consider senatorial candidates who dabble in witchcraft. We should make sure that our future scholars, engineers and scientists don't get sucked into the same maelstrom where fact and fiction become indistinguishable or our economy, society and planet will become extinct in a hurry. The only truth in the universe is the laws of nature and nobody is beyond those laws, even if our politicians by and large believe they are.	4426679	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

Common sense	30	0	The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.	4426654	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

Tom McMahon	5	0	Actually the internest stands to make research even greater in depth more available to all on any given subject. Academic study, any research paper done today has international data avilable like never before. The internet is full of terrible information as well, undocumented, unproven and unreliable. However if used right one can learn as much with a computer and the internet as any university can teach. I have educated myself with the internet on a number of subjects I am interested in and can answer off the cuff questions regarding any of those given subjects with direct factual answers without rhetoric. If only all Americans felt the same urge to learn we as a nation would be in much better condition. ignorance is not bliss, it's anger, depression and a feeling of hopelessness Thomas McMahon Millis Ma	4426345	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

Marco Scalvini	7	0	I personally think that using arguments and evidence is central in any debate. However the nature of research changed with the advent of databases and google. Moreover the Internet has dramatically changed the way people discuss or just get information about public issues. Perhaps, it would be more helpful to teach students how to deal with digital tools more consciously. For example, when I was a TA, my supervisor gave to his undergraduate students a very original assignment: writing a wikipedia entry. Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality.	4425625	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

Miskatonic	26	0	"""Are research papers a waste of time?"" Absolutely not! The internet may give students and scholars easy access to sources, but many of these sources are flawed or unreliable in some way. Now more than ever, students need to know how to sift through information to find reliable sources and well-constructed arguments. Writing a research paper is still the best way to do this. Select a paper topic that you find interesting or important. Read and evaluate 10-15 reputable sources related to your topic, and then build an argument that engages with and contributes to this existing research. This might not be the most exciting assignment in the world (depends on the topic, I suppose) but it teaches skills that every college graduate should have. Really, every high school graduate ought to have this training as well. But let's not ask for the moon!"	4425252	Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Are Research Papers a Waste of Time?

Patrick Borunda	9	0	For the most part, I think the NYT Comments enterprise is one of the most worthwhile available domestically today. My other obligatory daily reads (WaPo and the often contemptible WSJ) eh, not so much. Yes, trolls are a problem and comments must be moderated to make any sense. I often learn more from the comments than I do from the source article and that is a very valuable contribution. I enjoy my reflecting on how the commenters may have gotten to their perspective. I don't need to agree...I just want to understand Having said that, I am rather curious about why the often thunderous commentary about the clear pro-Clinton and anti-Sanders endorsement by the Editorial Board and the partisan columns by people for whom my respect has diminished in recent months (Krugman and Blow, for example) seem to not deter or even enlighten their conversation. Please, Gail and Linda...don't go down that rabbit hole. At the end of the day...one of the casualties of the 2016 campaign may be the credibility of the Grey Lady.	18250051	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Brian	4	0	I seldom read any column or analysis that does not allow comments. I join the others who say they often get more info and insight from the comments than the original piece. Moderating, at this stage in publishing, seems essential to diminish the troll effect. I would suggest a stated policy of allowing only one or two comments per article would also help. One need only go to WaPo to see why. Most comments sections contain over 1,000 posts and are filled with individuals posting scores of comments. Another idea would be to increase moderating and charge a higher subscription rate for the privilege of commenting. One could continue to allow all to read the comments, just charge for writing them. I would be willing to pay a few bucks a month more.	18247581	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Mary O	8	0	I find a lot of valuable information in the comments sections on the NYTimes. For the most part, the comments remain civil, and they are worth reading. Some commenters have even built up quite a following for their well-thought-out remarks. My Boston Globe subscription, not so much. The online comments are often vulgar and I usually don't bother reading them. Some of us aren't on social media -- I don't have a facebook or twitter account, and haven't seen the appeal of starting now. So the comment sections are still quite relevant to me!	18246959	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Dreamer	21	0	As many have already commented here, the comments section in NYT is really superb. Now that I am retired and have more time to devote to reading the articles in NYT online, I find that the comments are an excellent addition to the original articles. When I find some thoughtful and well-reasoned comments that have been 'recommended' a few hundred times or even a few thousand times, I say to myself, 'wow, that commenter really knows what he is talking about and it really resonates with so many people; and equally amazingly, so many people actually read the article and also the comments section! there must be a lot of thinking, intelligent people around; that is so comforting to contemplate.'	18246214	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

achilles13	4	0	I hope this discussion isn;t some trial balloon to gauge public feeling about shutting down the comments section. There are sites where the comments are often crass, personal, ad hominem, abusive and so forth both to the author of the piece and other commenters, but I haven't found this to be true of the NYT, probably in part because of the staff that does the moderating. So, if you need a vote, consider this a vote in favor of continuation of a policy of allowing readers' comments. At least that way you know there's a world out there and someone is hearing the tree fall in the forest.	18256373	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Tim Straus	1	0	I read the NYT and WSJ every day and comment on both. The WSJ is a complete free for all with about 1/2 of the comments and 75% of the replies TROLL QUALITY. Despite this, I find some of the POV's quite interesting and actually broaden my perspective in that I generally do not agree, but find the points made interesting. The NYT moderates the comments section, so there is little TROLLISHNESS. And while I do appreciate not having to filter through the clutter of the WSJ, at times I do find it a bit sanitized. What's a publication to do???? I would publish all except for the most brutish that make no point other just calling a person or a party or a group an unflattering name.	18250364	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

PaulB	3	0	When publications allow totally anonymous comments, chaos follows. One gets the feeling that comments are posted by dirty old men in the basement, or 14-year-old dropouts. The NY Times does it right, despite some obvious flaws, such as rewarding quick posting regulars who often set the tone for subsequent commentary. Yet on issues such as North Carolina's egregious HB2, comments from around the world are illuminating and revealing, which adds context, flavor and perspective to the original article. That's a good thing.	18248396	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Sequel	4	0	I prefer to know how many people are responding to a Times article in a manner that would please Nazi's and racists and homophobes. I prefer to know why they think such horrifying things, and how deeply they feel about it. And I really appreciate seeing how people hasten to tell them they are seriously wrong. I don't feel that I am in any danger of absorbing horrific ideas simply by hearing them. I would call that a bogus social theory. The converse of the idea that social engineering of permissible ideas is a good thing, is that people respond better if only exposed to approved ideas. That's just as bad.	18247485	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Kathryn Cox	4	0	I look forward to reading comments in the NYT's and for the most part, I'm on board and learn from many of the commenters both regular and occasional. On occasion, I've attempted to read comments on other news sites and find that many of them contain back and forth banter for lack of a better word between two people with little input from others. This gets old rather quickly. I choose to read the intelligent and well thought out comments both from the left and right. I do lean more to those comments that lean more to the left.

Tom	4	0	"The problem that I'm having at this moment is that there is a saying, ""those that control the vote controls the election."" The same thing thing can apply to a blog like Paul K. and the NYT, who has endorsed HC. Are thumbs up or down being controlled in favored of the person that they have endorsed? Are comments being generated in favor in the person that they have endorsed? I'v been reading PK and the NYT since the start of Berrnie Sanders run for POTUS and most of it posting was for BS with thumbs up ranging from 200 to 500 thumbs up. Then a couple weeks ago a almost complete shift from BS to HC, with HC thumbs up in the hundreds? Maybe it's just me, but it appears the comments are being manufactured lately in HC favor? So, if you control the vote,you control the election, and if you control the blog and the comment section more than likely you control the final thought process ."	18246850	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

MAL	6	0	I comment reasonably frequently and also read a lot more than I would otherwise because of the comments. Mostly I feel the Times does a decent job moderating the comments, although I often notice the same pro-Hillary bias in many of the NYT picks as opposed to the Reader's Picks. (Anecdotally, this bias in the picks seems to be diminishing.) I also agree that many commenters are predictable, but because of their status, make it to the front of the line. I wonder if more courageous columnists might be willing to directly take on points that commenters raise. I feel that there is an awful lot of repetition of memes by columnists that have been discredited, such as Sanders's supposed pro-gun positions, when in fact he has a D minus rating from the NRA. Often it is commenters who bring these up, and columnists never address them. While I know you can't write a column by committee, I think a columnist that occasionally addressed specific, thoughtful reactions to his/her columns could bring in a lot of readers, and make readers feel they are listened to by the Times.	18246663	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

michael kittle	9	0	As a former psychologist and career counselor, I am interested in encouraging forms of expression that reinforce good mental health. On line commenting has been over taken, sabotaged, and abused with a high percentage of mentally unhealthy abusive speech. This one negative aspect is significant enough to justify abolishing commenting. This unhealthy behavior does not serve as a safety valve but rather encourages self destructive ruminating that can explode in violence.

Dean	65	0	I am a lifelong reader of the NYT and its comments sections are invaluable to me. As others have said, I often learn as much from the comments as I do from the original article; and I enjoy and appreciate the points of view of other informed readers, even those with whom I disagree, without wading through pages of muck. Yes, I know the NYT's heavy moderation is time-consuming and expensive -- but I believe it has paid off. I would spend much less time reading the NY Times if it did not have its thoughtfully moderated comments. Personally, I think this is a major reason why, unlike so many established newspapers, the NYT seems to be thriving in today's digital world with its online editions.	18241371	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Abbott Hall	1	0	The quality of reporting and the general knowledge of writers and editors has markedly decreased in the past 30 years. Many of the commentators are more intelligent and knowledgable than the beat reporters and the columnists.

Dan Frazier	1	0	The Internet would be a vastly different place if we could somehow do away with anonymity. But would it actually be a better place? In our very polarized world, many people are understandably reluctant to speak out on controversial issues, unless they can do so anonymously. If we want to know what people really think, we need to let them speak anonymously. So long as there has been written communication, people have had that ability, and maybe that right. Before that, people threw rocks under cover of darkness to get their point across. I understand the temptation to demand that people use their real identities, but it seems almost impossible to do in the real world. Even if you ask for a scan of my driver's license, you can't be sure it is really my license, or be sure that it has not been altered.	18249267	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Sam I Am	5	0	Real-name attribution shouldn't be the rule, at least on this site. As it stands, all NY Times commenters are known by their real names by the NY Times. Since the NY Times can suspend or terminate commenting privileges, this private real-name attribution does 95% of the job in ensuring online civility. Making everyone go by the real name publicly would enhance online civility but at too high a price. I use a pseudonym not because of fear of attribution by people I know, but because I don't wish to become the target of trolls in the real world. I have a name, a profession, a home and a family that doesn't need trolling by haters who object to my views. Yet I'd still like to participate in the public discussion. Frankly, I'm amazed that so many people willingly embrace notoriety through the NY Times comment board. I've often wondered what repercussions a Rima Rigas (for example) experiences in the real world. I think everyone should have a pseudonym, and we should rely on the NY Times to suspend and ban the trolls.	18248158	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Tim McCoy	5	0	Mr. Wolf sounds as if he would have castigated Mark Twain, and George Sand for using pseudonyms. The fictitious nom de plume is an old and venerable way for writers to express themselves. The actual solution is the one the New York Times employs. Editing irrational or vitriolic commentary, rather than publishing everything, afraid of offending a subscriber here and there if they don't. Instead of threatening to throw out the baby with the bathwater as an alternative, or subjecting the commentariat to TSA type scrutiny before allowing our opinions to be published.	18247674	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Sequel	2	0	"No one knows whether a ""real-looking"" name on a comment is authentic, nor do they agree on even what makes a name ""real-looking"". Furthermore, there is actually very little agreement on whether an idea is offensive merely because of the way it is expressed, or whether certain ideas should be considered so offensive that they may never be expressed in even the most cultivated verbiage. The writer's premise that anonymity produces bad ideas and vulgar expression appears highly doubtful. I submit that the quality of the idea being discussed is the only thing that matters, and that there will never be a consensus on that evaluation. If quality is too low (as in the bulk of what appears on Twitter), individuals are free to consider the idea poor or the manner of expression deficient. Openly airing all ideas still appears preferable to me to confining discourse to speakers who only express the right ideas, and who do so with a prescribed minimum of elegance. It's a superstition, but I'll stick with Justice Brandeis' axiom that ""sunshine is the best disinfectant."""	18246960	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Joe Mastroianni	2	0	I wonder of what use my comments would be without that I stood by them. Do I honestly have any crucial wisdom to impart upon the world that would be of such benefit that even doing so anonymously would be of service to the community? Or does it just make me feel good to spew? But truthfully - the reaction given by the readership here - anonymous or not - has got to be a reasonable barometer of the feelings of the community, whether or not an individual feels comfortable posting as a person, or only as a glyph. And there is value in that for us all.	18246562	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

jim	9	0	I am a gay man who has been living for several decades with HIV. I frequently comment on both health and political articles and use my very personal story to illuminate some aspect of the topic or to explain my viewpoint. I think that this perspective can be important, but if I could not post anonymously I would remain silent. Before the days of on-line commenting I was an avid writer of letters to the editor and on several occasions I received hate mail and threatening phone calls. I'm no longer willing to set myself up as that kind of target. Also, even if you abolish anonymous posting it's easy enough for the motivated trolls to fake their on-line id and continue to post their bile.	18246092	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Dave	28	0	Real names don't really help. As many other commenters have pointed out, they actually make it easier for online harassment to turn into offline harassment. What does make a difference is long-term accountability. Have pseudonyms tied to an email account that has to be verified periodically (e.g. once a year), and give pseudonyms a reputation score based on moderation (either by paid moderators as the Times does, or by other readers). Those with a high reputation score get perks like their comments being shown earlier, while those with a low reputation score get demoted to the bottom sections that almost nobody sees. That helps clear out the trolls or at least make them invisible.	18243621	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Johnny Comelately	2	0	Shutting down comments sections forces discussion outside of view. It is far better and safer to know the awful truth than to have it hidden from you, to spring up some day fully formed in an unstoppable attack on our carefully tended, walled in and blindfolded world. Than is not to say that some measure of civil discourse rules should not be adopted and enforced, they should. That raises the cost of tending to the comment section, unfortunately. Robots are getting smarter and at some point will take over that job. At such point, they can be used to create the very walls I would worry about - hiding the truth from us again, but this time not because of a simple exclusive wall against free comment. Instead because the robot algorithm may not be able to distinguish some important and ugly truth from an ad hominem attack, giving this more careful wall a small but important factual bias that can no longer open our eyes.	18378733	Sat Apr 30 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Naphthous	12	0	The most insightful writing to be found in almost any article occurs in the comments. Rarely is there a significant article that is neither debunked nor enhanced by the best of the comments. I have actually started checking whether comments are enabled before I read an article - and NOT reading it if they are disabled. To me, disabling comments is a sign of weakness and/or dishonesty on the part of the author and/or the publisher. It shows a fear of dissent, a fear of being scrutinized and/or challenged. Perhaps there is an underlying insecurity about not being viewed as an authoritative voice. The solution to repugnant comments isn't to ban all comments. The solution is mechanisms (which have existed for ages) that filter, sort, and hide comments at the pleasure of the user.	18277984	Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Norton	3	0	In all honesty, if I were a published author (as I aspire to be someday), I might not want to read even the good comments about my work. I do know some authors who do not read either the good nor the bad. That, to me, is understandable. However, why should the rest of the world feel the same way? If someone wants to offer an insight - and other people read it and get something from it (whether or not the original author gets involved), why deny that basic right to free speech? There will always be bullies, online or in the real world. You cannot stop them completely, but to not allow the general public to have discourse because trolls exist, then why write anything in the first place? You may as well keep it in diary form, to be seen by no one by yourself.	18250354	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

DBL	10	0	The NY Times comments are the only ones I read anymore, so I would hate for it to be discontinued. I can imagine the work involved in moderating the comments; unfortunately, I don't see a way around it anymore to keep thought-provoking, and informative dialog going. It is sad, but it is also obvious that there are more than a few people who troll various sites for issues/people that bother them so they can unleash their self-righteous intolerance and name-calling. Ironically, it is usually these same people projecting their negative attributes to others. I enjoy the NYT comments section. Most of the comments seem well thought out and on-point, and the commenters are very knowledgeable. I frequently learn something new or see a point of view I hadn't considered.	18250327	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

While one might think there would be some intelligent commentary accompanying news articles in that respected venue, a relatively small posse of regulars-on both sides of the political spectrum-seize every chance to hurl utterly unrelated partisan insults at one another.

Patricia	2	0	I don't think the drug reform or criminal justice reform movements would be where they are right now if not for the power of online comments. The media status quo have in the past supported the Drug War without question and played respectability politics to keep drug reform arguments out of the public eye. That's one of the things that got us into mass incarceration in the first place. A big reason why we are moving out of that period now is because various people outside the media elite who have their facts together on drug and criminal justice reform were able to use comments sections to communicate arguments about race and drug enforcement and criminal justice policy that the media status quo wasn't ready to play in prime time. This wound up educating the media status quo and now the way the media cover drug policy has changed completely. This is a victory for democracy and for online comments.	18249097	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Jack Robinson	2	0	Comments are a useful and frequently informative part of online news; they should be encouraged but much more closely monitored. For openers, commenters should be allowed only one comment per article to avoid these ubiquitous back and forth , witless arguments which often clog the comments section. Obscene, vulgar and personal attacks should be edited out, but care must be exercised. Many subjects almost demand strong comments which some may find offensive, but do not really cross the line. Some are clearly at the far left, right, or some other extreme, but often bring out ignored, but important points of view. In addition, many articles and editorials contain claims that are either wrong or at best distorted, despite usually high standards of editorial review. Comments are essential for correcting these problems. Some blogs, like Prof Juan Cole usually contain thoughtful, informed and useful information. Others seem to call forth the the worst forms of trolls, bullys, idiots and haters. Proper monitoring, I believe can correct the abuses and allow a very important part of the internet to thrive.	18249031	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Barbara Steinberg	1	0	Human moderation is the key. There are terms and conditions, and if a commenter fails to meet them, their comment does not get posted. The network should disallow anonymous posting. This means comment sections cost a newspaper more money, as they generate money. Do they make a profit? As newspapers are firing employees, it becomes a hard choice. If disabling a comment section does not hurt the bottom line, get rid of it. No one wants to know what is at the anonymous back of anyone's mind in the age of social media.	18248691	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

CBJ	4	0	Moderate and block if necessary. Without readers comments the Times would be greatly diminished. I'm as interested in them as I am in my most respected reporters and columnist. Comments sections that are not moderated get no attention from me. The Times is to be commended for supporting readers comments even though they are often managed arbitrarily as Margaret Sullivan's last column's comments were and are. Where probably hundreds of readers positive remarks were not posted. it was an important column from an admired writer.	18248616	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

MushyWaffle	1	0	The problem I find, is many times there are things said in articles that are wrong. This puts a compulsion in many of us, that requires us to make sure the record is straight. Otherwise many will read something with no discussion and think the article is valid, when it's not. People often feel connected to an article and take it personally when something needs to be stated in a more clear fashion. I have often learned things from comment sections that added value or clarified issues that were not address in the article but should have been. The solution for bigotry and vitriol is not taking the voice from people. Censorship should never be allowed. There are several way to address this issue when it comes to forums. Hell, just hire a low level student editor that cuts his teeth on forum controls. Much better to pay someone $15/hr than isolating the very people you are trying to reach by taking away their voice.	18248417	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Penpoint	1	0	Moderated comments are an excellent way for original ideas to be heard from the most unlikely corners. Sifting through a lot of unmoderated comments is not only distressing for the author, it is discouraging for the reader and serious commentator. Publications that want to engage a mass audience and those that seek to interact with more narrow expert audiences should put the resources into professionally moderating comments.	18248249	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Rodrian Roadeye	1	0	Media has found too much truth in readers' comments and has started censoring views contrary to who pays the bills. The Daily KOS for example has flagged more negative views on Hillary than any other Progressive site. This is NOT freedom of speech when others have the power to silence your opinion. And even the NYT was guilty of a lack of attention to Sanders campaign for awhile. Yet Trump has garnished more free publicity than them all because of the increased readership draw, therefore more profits in their advertising dollars. And around the world we are laughed at because we have a reality show candidate, another family oligarch, and all the other clowns on the Republican wagon. Welcome to the Freakshow.	18248245	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Bill	1	0	The best comments are those that make me think about things differently. They often introduce thoughts and ideas that haven't been given a voice in regular editorial content. And often they are those with which I disagree. Such comments are rare--a rate I would guess at less than 1 in 20. But if they introduce me to a new way of thinking, or of just understanding my fellow humans, it's well worth sorting through the other 19. Editing makes all the difference. The Times' editing is, to some extent, crowd sourced--the most popular comments are given prominence. I will, from time to time, up-vote a comment with which I disagree just because it introduces a new idea.	18248069	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

WKing	12	0	I would cancel my online subscription without comments. That said, I believe the Times, if not censoring, is unduly influencing the impact of their news by not only moderating comments, but by not allowing comments on all stories and by varying the time that comments are open. The story about Amazon's work environment comes to mind. They were quite literally pilloried by the comment section being opened for several days and 5000 comments. Rarely are comments open for more than a day for most stories.	18247880	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

totyson	16	0	I am extremely grateful for the moderators at NYT, and I shudder to think of the things they must have to read through. The NYT comments are the only ones I currently read. I follow many comment writers here, both agreeing and disagreeing with them. Some I look forward to, if only to have my own world view challenged. It would be too easy to read only those opinions that I share, and have myself devolve into a participant in the echo chamber that seems to feed too many steadfastly held beliefs out there. As for the anonymity, I never really thought that I might be hiding behind my user name. It goes way back to 1999 when I first subscribed. I am Tom Tyson, and I live in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. You can call me Tom.	18247937	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

lloydmi	12	0	Without open comment, I rarely any longer bother to read the article. Unlike Jamilla, I always check the comments first to see whether the article will be exciting. The NYTimes is the only venue that censors over half of my remarks, the Post and WSJ almost never. I don't mind offending, but find what is censored 100% here is trying to be funny or ironic.

ridgeguy	5	0	I learn quite a lot from NYT comments, often and in particular from thoughtful comments by authors who think differently from me. I find them valuable. I think the Times' general level of commentary is good. This in part results from the Times' curating its comments, which filters the merely shrill or ad hominem screeds. I recognize this also introduces curatorial bias, but for me, the reduction in noise is welcome. I hope the Times continues to solicit reader commentary. I think its system is working well.	18247132	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

RB	1	0	I personally think that any organization allowed to provide Press Cards to its employees should be required by the law to have a public section comment on its website. Think about it, people are being put in jail to protect the right of journalists. The least they can do is defending the freedom of speech of others, journalists need to be held accountable on that, a right without a duty is an oligarchic priviledge. They should be required to provide and sustain a space for open debate for any information they provide. Comments sections have fails because media failed them by treating them as after thoughts, and under investing in them. What's missing is a whole ecosystem of accountability as far as journalism and freedom of speech are concerned.	18247080	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Hydraulic Engineer	5	0	I am a frequent comment contributor to this NY Times Comments section, and an even more frequent reader of comments by others here. Please, keep this comment service! I usually read an article that interests me, then immediately read the NY Times selection of representative comments with great relish, because I know that there is a community of bright, well meaning, and responsible comment writers who will provide perspectives missing from the original article. Such good writers many of the commenters are! I regularly have my opinion affected by the comments in the NY Times. That said, the comment sections from virtually all other publications I have encountered are unfortunately dominated by people venting often foolish, badly written, negative comments. Such publications should either upgrade their comment section by adding adequate pre-publishing review, or I would sadly agree that those comment sections should be dropped.	18247061	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Randy Tucker	6	0	I'm a big fan of comments sections. All to often opinion pieces are no more than the space where a publication gets to spout it's own talking points and perspectives. Worse, it sometimes seems that the journalistic slant in articles are intended to reinforce the 'opinion' which the Editorial Board later gives it's blessing to on the op-ed pages. The fact is, many of the very best insights and most honest disagreements manifest only in the comments of readers. Views that the Publisher or editorial board of a publication do not necessarily agree with.	18246592	Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

BillG	10	0	1) Except for updates and corrections to the story, authors who get involved in the comments section of their articles are not doing themselves any service. 2) It may come as a surprise, but authors of articles are not omniscient. Comment sections usually bring out pertinent points and perspectives that the author omits. 3) It is important, especially for social and politics issues to understand not only the content of an article but what the opinion of the public is toward the article that can be particularly important, and more relevant than any poll. 4) The internet is, by nature, interactive. If you present topics of current interest and don't give people the ability to interact with them, people will go elsewhere to where they can. 5) Most people want to have a discussion about issues that of importance to them, few simply want to sit and be lectured to.	18246465	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Steve Bell	1	0	The problem is how nasty, vulgar, and hate filled many of those unmoderated comments can be. Until the web provided unfiltered commentary, an editor always moderated publication. What we have in unmoderated commentary is often not the correcting of misstatements, or the expanding of the conversation, but commenters attacking other commenters, hurling insults, changing the subject to beat the commenter's drum. We get lots of Obama hate even when the subject isn't Obama. If we had a culture of common courtesy before this, it's been severely jeopardized by coarse talk in comment sections. We even see that coarseness celebrated now as a good thing.	18244954	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Justice Holmes	1	0	Oftenthe comments sections are where the biased reporting is set to rights. Unfortunately for those of us who used to rely on the NYT to be unbiased straightforward reporting, thst has changed. As a result, opinions are presented as facts. Words pregnant with multiple meanings are used to slant stories to placate corproate owners. Comments give those of us who read other sources like European papers to as a bit of balance and to fact check the fact checkers. Comments are important. Those who don't like them have very likely been found out once to often by observant readers and they want it to stop!

Rahul	2	0	Comments are necessary because Opinion pieces and publications are often promoting a narrow agenda that is masquerading as majority opinion and settled debate. Comments section balances out the opinion and offers an alternate view as well as evidence that contradicts the opinion piece. That is what a good debate is about. Comments should be moderated but with a light touch that allows legitimate discussion to get through. I would not read any article or publication that does not allow comments to get through. My opinion of an editorial or commentary immediately goes down and I ascribe less value to that article if it does not accept comments. Not accepting comments means that the author is afraid of debate and criticism and has this superior attitude, that I know more than you and therefore you have to accept my opinion as the the final word on this topic. No you are not, and no I don't have to!	18243112	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Eloise Rosas	55	0	One does NOT have to read the comments, and one can easily skip over the hate. But often I learn more from the comments than from the article, story, or opinion piece. Sadly, the media is so biased and slanted (NYT included) that without the comments one simply does not really know what is going on.	18242280	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Wally Wolf	93	0	One of the main reasons, other than the excellent articles, that I have a subscription to the New York Times is because they do allow comments. I usually spend as much time reading the comments as I do the articles. I find that the people who comment on the NYT website are intelligent, have a lot to offer, and I find their comments thought provoking. It is one of the rare websites where comments are allowed and no trash gets published. I rarely take part in or read the comment sections on other websites. As far as I'm concerned, it's a safe haven where minds can meet and share ideas. It would be a tragedy if the NYT would discontinue our ability to comment.	18242040	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Matt B	19	0	Comment sections are important in understanding the viewpoints and passions that may incite people to disagree. In the empathetic exercise of understanding why people think or feel how they do, we can better understand their argument so that it can be fought with reason - instead of dismissed on grounds that one is crazy or bigoted. Personally I love reading the opinion pieces where multiple writers take a different spin on the same prompt, and comments sections allow a microcosm to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of dozens of perspectives.	18244013	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Dan	110	0	Until recently I was a frequent contributor to the comment section of my local newspaper. When I began contributing I had hoped for intelligent and meaningful discussion and debate concerning the subject. What I had found was a medium consisting of contributors who, by appearances, thrive on belittling and disparaging attacks on those who don't share their beliefs. After a few years, I removed my profiles due to the increasing belittlement and disparagement of posters who may disagree with ones opinion. These forums appear, to me, nothing more than an electronic school yard full of anonymous bullies who have little to offer to any debate or discussion. I welcome the moderation the NY Times offers the readers and contributors to the online comments. Regards, Dan	18244743	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

dcaryhart	25	0	The Slowly Boiled Frog is mostly about LGBT advocacy. I frequently have posts with 100  comments (unmoderated). My experience is that opponents to gay rights tend to behave themselves; framing their arguments as inoffensively as possible. Meanwhile my core readers refine and shape their arguments accordingly which, I think, serves them and us. I have learned a thing or two from a dedicated reader. I have also witnessed opponents gaining a greater understanding of our needs and concerns. No, I think that the comments section is a very good thing.	18244216	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Engagement is too valuable to the organization for it to give up and eliminate comments. As a form of engagement, which drives loyalty and repeat business, it must be invested in by paying for moderators.

Nathan an Expat	34	0	"A lot of the anxiety of the commentariat when it comes to the issue of online comments simply reflects the precipitous decline in deference afforded the once proud professional pontificator. They used to provide the final word. Now more often then not if they do their job right they are at best conversation starters. And what a conversation it has become, I often can't wait to get to the comments after reading an article eager to sift through the non sequiturs and sophomoric sonambulism to find the real analytical gems so often to be found there. Like the saying goes ""sometimes you have to kiss a lot of frogs"" ... As to trolls meh. They can be dealt with. I for one am fully in favour of moderated comments that remove the venom and bile that can sometimes be spewed by the web yet retain the wonderful crowd sourced intelligence, wisdom and wit of fellow readers. I've read these comments. I know these comments and trust me the people writing these aren't ""punching up"" they're elevating the intellectual quality of the whole experience.

Dave	16	0	One of the useful roles a comment sections can serve: an immediate correction mechanism from the general public when an author is demonstrably wrong on the facts. For example, another news site ran an article decrying the fact that none of the presidential candidates had bothered to pay any attention to New York's public housing projects. Within about 15 minutes of the story being released, commenters were putting up links to stories about Bernie Sanders visiting New York's public housing projects about 10 hours earlier, a rebuttal that many readers might have been unaware of had the comment section not existed. And the New York Times' centralized moderation system isn't the only way to get real legitimate debate going, with evidence and logic being thrown around (along with the occasional entertainment like parody song lyrics or poetry).	18243443	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

A	7	0	What is most disturbing about the troll menace is how a (presumably) small minority of posters can trash an entire thread of discussion. That could never happen in a public square (or Trump rally). So it seems that civic-minded people must not give in to the trolls. Otherwise, we are letting them restrict our freedom to share thoughtful opinion with others. A way must be found to vote out the trolls. For example, comments could be rated by readers as constructive or destructive. The more destructive the rating, the lower that comment falls to the bottom of the heap. Only the thoughtful, constructive posts, as rated by the community of readers, would remain at the top. It could be automated, thus, reducing the cost of hiring moderators. Do others see a flaw in this proposal?	18240859	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Comment Sections Failed?

Geoff Welborn	3	0	Thank you! I taught for nine years in Watts at one of the lowest performing schools in Country. The teach for America kids were great but their motives were 'on to bigger and better things' Not one of them stuck around after a year or two. Further, I felt they were treated,more often than not, as warm bodies to fill staffing shortages. Which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing but there appeared, at least in the situation I observed, to be absolutely no support for them once they were in the classroom. It was kind of like dropping somebody into a combat situation with no arms training. In the inner city situation you need more than academics. You need classroom management skills.	2262682	Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	false	false	TFA has not raised the status of teachers
Gideon	2	0	According to this perspective, we should view Peace Corps volunteers as a threat to the developing world, Meals on Wheels as a threat to the culinary arts, and AmeriCorps as a threat to the United States. Teach for America is a response to the deplorable condition in many rural and urban schools, which pre-date the existence of this program by decades. The reactionary response from educators who have failed to improve the educational achievement of underserved students only reinforces the need for something new and innovative. No one pretends that TFA is THE solution to public education, but at least it's focused in a tangible way on the places with the greatest needs.	2262089	Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	true	false	TFA has raised the status of public teachers
Ladmeaux	4	0	Teach for America has done nothing for public school teachers's status. The only thing it has done is fetishize its own image, to create a trendy CV filler for cossetted Ivy Leaguers. The vast majority of TFA teachers don't stay in the profession, so the job becomes little more than a balm for their conscious before they move on to JP Morgan Chase and like-minded capitalist enterprises. It takes more than two years to become a good teacher, so if TFA has such a low retention rate for its students, how can it be rated a success? The fact that admission is difficult doesn't mean its a good program.	2262077	Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	false	false	TFA has not raised the status of teachers
Sylvanus	6	0	A retired teacher who observed, and often mentored, many Teach for America teachers, I whole-heartedly support Ms. Crocco's observations. In what other profession would it be assumed that minimal training, no matter how well-educated one happens to be, is sufficient to enter the field: law, medicine? The fact we not only allow it, but encourage such an approach in eduction to me says a great deal about how teaching is viewed in this country, that is, it is not truly a profession. One will never build a first-class educational system based on this widely held conviction. For further thoughts, I refer the reader to the book by Diane Ravitch (one of the best historians of American schools) The Death and Life of the Great American School system.	2261790	Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	false	false	TFA has not raised the status of teachers
Wasting time	13	0	I wonder how having one or two Teach for America teachers at a school can make a difference. A few children, lucky to be in those classes, may benefit but how does it benefit the school as a whole? And what does it do for the morale of the regular teaching staff, many of whom may be wonderful, dedicated teachers to have these neophytes who come with a label of special, gifted drop into their schools as though manna from heaven? Finally, do these special, gifted new teachers have some kind of solution for the poverty and other conditions that surely have at least, if not more, to do with the condition of their schools and their academic achievement than does the ability of the teacher? Can they magically help the parent who doesn't have the education to help or encourage the child? Can they promise these kids that if they work hard and do well, they will have a better life?	2261238	Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	false	false	TFA has not raised the status of teachers

Sally	4	0	Many TFA folks are feeling defensive these days, and rightly so. The program promises more than it can deliver. It is not the fault of these idealistic and/or ambitious young people that the program has been overly touted as the silver bullet for all education's problems. There is nothing wrong with leaving education after two years, becoming an administrator or going to law school. The problem is that attrition is basically a design feature of the program. An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years. I almost did, until I realized that I needed to set boundaries and have a life. The problem is that students pay by losing energetic teachers every year, would-be teachers are discouraged and leave the classroom, and the taxpayers are footing too much of the bill for a program with questionable returns. There needs to be an overhaul if the public is to be expected to continue supporting a program that is not successful in helping create long term stability in schools.	2264611	Fri Jul 16 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	false	false	TFA has not raised the status of teachers

"-jm"	1	0	Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators.	2264131	Fri Jul 16 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	false	false	TFA has raised the status of public teachers

Richard Lachmann	11	0	One of the most important contributions to US education from TFA alumni has not been mentioned by any of the contributors to this discussion. The TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children and their schools. They can and do give voice to those realities in political debates and can counter the many (often willfully) ignorant claims of opponents of public education. Just as Peace Corp volunteers are a source of reality about the Third World, so TFA alumni can and do continue to advocate for poor children and their schools when they become investment bankers, lawyers, or other high earners. Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers. Rather than harp on the limits of TFA, we should recognize that Wendy Kopp has found a way to move politics in a progressive direction and spend our efforts applying its lessons to other areas of public policy and politics.	2263128	Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	false	false	TFA has raised the status of public teachers
Terry Brennan	4	0	Wait a minute: Don't very wealthy, un-elected people have huge power in every political area of influence in our culture. They have the success to show the way. We look up to them. Why shouldn't they have something constructive to say about education. I feel that traditionally trained teachers are chosen from the least talented pool of students. Their SAT and GRE scores are consistently in the bottom third. We need a bunch from the top third and the middle third, and we need huge improvement in MATH & SCIENCE. We do not need a bunch of obstructive, complacent union drones clogging up the arteries of education. We need more flexible educational leadership, and more rewards for excellent teachers.	2263119	Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Teaching: The Passion and the Profession	Has Teach for America raised the status of public school teachers?	/roomfordebate/2010/07/14/does-teach-for-america-improve-the-teaching-profession	TFA has not raised the status of teachers	TFA has raised the status of public teachers	false	false	TFA has raised the status of public teachers

Yes, I know William is much cooler. however whatever his shortcomings, Charles does not deserve the unprecedented humiliation of being passed over after waiting patiently and loyally for over 40 years. It's just not fair. I think Charles would be a reasonably good Monarch. His biggest problem is Camilla. I'm going to be brutally honest, and expect to get some flak as a result. Dianna was undoubtedly the Queen of Hearts, a star with a capital S, gorgeous, charismatic and blessed with incredible ability for empathy. However as Eliabeth has proven beyond doubt, one does not need to be a star to be a good monarch. Camilla is no Dianna, but she is, like it or not infinitely more suited to be Queen of the Realm then Dianna could ever hope to be."	9565783	Fri Jul 26 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Queen Elizabeth II Step Down?

AMLH	8	0	I think questions about the queen abdicating in favor of her son are grounded in sexism. Would there be noise about abdication if the current monarch were a king? Would he be pressed to abdicate in favor of a daugther? Elizabeth II would be the only British monarch ever to abdicate, except for the ignoble Prince of Wales who abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson and lives in disgrace in the British consciousness as a result. The throne of England is a position for life; it is an investiture.

SouthernView	2	0	Fletcher has got it exactly right. The best solution would be for both Elizabeth and Charles to abdicate and turn the Firm over to William and Kate. But since that will not happen, let's postpone until we're left with no choice the ascension of Charles--and even worse, Camilla. The thought of boring, stuffed-shirt Charles as king for decades is bad enough, but having Camilla shoved front and center would be a nightmare come true, even without the formal title of queen. Imagine-year after year of pictures of the two puttering in their garden with their little spades and shooting grouse at Balmoral. Oh, the horror, the horror-made even worse by knowing that Will and Kate are having to lie low. Of course, knowing the media's attention will gravitate anyway toward the young and vibrant, I feel a tinge of sympathy for the sad fate awaiting Charles and Camilla.	9557843	Thu Jul 25 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Queen Elizabeth II Step Down?

Withheld	1	0	In two hundred years, a blip on the timeline of the British Monarchy, average people will be living until either they fall off a cliff, or reach 150 or 200 years of age. For the queen to step down at 87 years, will seem looking back as premature. Looking form the 18th Century, stepping down at 87 would seem to be prudent, but everyone who was alive in the 19th C. is now dead. So hang in there -- but make Prince William and his wife do the work.	9556947	Thu Jul 25 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Queen Elizabeth II Step Down?

Don P.	7	0	Simply said the Queen is not going to step down. Upon ascending to the throne she made a vow to serve her people until her death. Words and the people who spoke them truly meant something at that time and still do to people of her generation. Queen Elizabeth came to the throne during a very difficult period for her people and the world and she helped lead her nation from those days to today always as a constant source of pride and inspiration. And it appears that the qualities that made her a loved and inspirational leader skipped a generation bypassing her son, Charles, and now appears rooted in her grandson, William. So I say save the questions about stepping down for Charles for the day after he ascends to the throne.	9557758	Thu Jul 25 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Should Queen Elizabeth II Step Down?

THM	2	0	I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.	15436973	Thu Jul 09 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is the Supreme Court Too Powerful?

Stan	1	0	"'You must vote,"" I often hear, ""because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!"" That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. ""living Constitution"", ""originalism"", ""texturalism""; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not ""umpires"", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are ""umpires"" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game."	15421004	Tue Jul 07 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is the Supreme Court Too Powerful?

B Franklin	1	0	A core example of Kramer's argument is the Bush v Gore decision. The court anointed the head of the executive branch by first finding for Gore, but then not allowing the recount to proceed due to an arbitrary time limit the Court set.

J. Cornelio	2	0	I think it was Churchill who said that democracy is the second worst form of government devised by man. What's the worst? Everything else. Our democracy suffers from some serious dysfunctions as the writer notes but I'd be hesitant to entrust nine (actually 5) unelected, usually pretty disconnected jurists in black robes the power to ... well, keep expanding their power. Whether you consider any particular ruling open-minded or open-hearted or reactionary or downright evil or righteous, history is strewn with the corpses of societies which fail to improve their democracy and, instead, turn to a select cabal to make critically important decisions. You wouldn't even have to keep money out of politics if we worked harder at educating our electorate so that they understand the extent to which the rich and powerful, and their toadies in government, manipulate our fears and our wants to avoid what THEY fear get what THEY want. To think that those who are already part of the mightiest of the power elite will ever do what's necessary to protect those who are not part of the power elite is delusional, if not worse.	15420691	Tue Jul 07 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is the Supreme Court Too Powerful?

Cedar	8	0	There has to be a forum in which a final decision is made when the legislative and executive branches cannot agree, or where laws passed by the states or federal government run contrary to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and/or current norms (such as gay marriage). Hence, the Supreme Court. Complain all you want, it's a system that has worked pretty well. The notable recent failures were the appointment of GW Bush as President and recent and repeated failures of civil rights for African Americans.

Tideplay	1	0	It is a known fact that the court has largely been a regressive institution of the status quo, upholding the worst aspects of our society, monopolies, capitalism, racism, slavery, Jim Crow, with holding of women's suffrage, segregation, abortion rights, voting rights and on and on. The exceptions are noteworthy and talked about as if they are heresy rather than proper. For example is it simply amazing that Justice Roberts cannot find anything in the Constitution that supports equal rights to marriage for all people!	15421914	Tue Jul 07 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is the Supreme Court Too Powerful?

Back to basics Rob	2	0	The professor should have asked the question about the Supreme Court to the millions of adults who did not have to go to racially segregated, unequally funded school systems; to the innocent people accused of crimes who managed to obtain justice through court-appointed attorneys; to the people shut out of racially biased hiring in private employment who obtained good jobs in government employment. Oh yes, interventions in the Democratic process include one person, one vote. Why don't we ask all the persons who can breathe clean air, drink clean water and not be subjected to the harmful chemicals from industrial polluters because the grip that reactionary southern states had on the Congress, preventing enactment of progressive legislation dealing with industrial pollution, faded with the oneperson, one vote rulings in the 1960's.

Curran	1	0	Dred Scott vs Sanford. I should probably end right there. But, yes to the question, I would still be ashamed--the (unjust) revisings of Law by the Justice's (or appellate judge's) command today are neither few nor small nor non-horrible. And don't forget that the guilded age was created, aided, and abetted by the similarly high-handed Lochner Court, damaging society by, say, effectively criminalizing unions (and letting employers enforce that by not-rare murders of any organizers) and many other things, for, what 40 years or so? Until the most powerful president thus far in history FDR forced them to change course just so he could stop them blocking his efforts to fight the Great Depression? And now we are told, in rulings that are nonsense when compared with the text of the 1st amendment they purportedly derive from, that 'money is speech', along with the power of rich and business over politicians? Oh--right, I was supposed to leave that one out. I would be ashamed. Dred Scott.	15421787	Tue Jul 07 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is the Supreme Court Too Powerful?

Brooklynite	3	0	Sounds like I'm not the only one who picked up on the obvious here, that cash is replacing regular patronage. Seems a dumb trade from the restaurateur's point of view. The few extra bucks he picks up from one-time diners is going to be drowned by all the money he loses from regular patrons, who can't get the convenience and service they want. They'll go elsewhere, and he'll never see those one-time trend-surfers ever again. Buh-bye, Empellon. As for myself, I think all this is deeply silly. If I can't get a table at a restaurant at a decent time without having to wait on line, I go somewhere else. Lots of people can cook. It's just not that rare a skill, especially in a city like New York.	12076148	Fri Jun 20 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Restaurant Reservations Be for Sale?

KS	9	0	My impression is that this commentator's restaurant business is marginal. He seems to have a problem with no-show reservations made through an online reservation service that costs him money. It seems to me that he is missing the concept that having his restaurant appear online, either on Resy or Opentable, amounts to advertising to the general public. On Resy, it is the customers, not him, who pays for the advertising. He seems to be heading toward the idea of making his restaurants more like dinner clubs for regular diners, and also VIPs, whoever they are. (Maybe he means the VIPs are the people who pay for a reservation.) Well, good luck with that. At the restaurants I like it seems they treat everyone who walks in the the door as a friend or a VIP, even when they apologize and put you on a waiting list to be seated.	12074156	Thu Jun 19 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Restaurant Reservations Be for Sale?

nl7	3	0	I don't comprehend the anger and vitriol. It comes across as a very conservative sense of entitlement. A restaurant is paying for food, drinks, service, ambience, seating, location, and a million other things. Some of these items are separately charged for, such as the food and drinks one orders, while others are recouped by unallocated charges on your bill. Part of that steak or wine you bought is actually going to dishwashing, real estate taxes, and new linens. Why should we get upset that some people are being specially charged for what they receive? It seems as silly to me as being angry that somebody who ordered lobster and whiskey pays more than somebody who got a sandwich and water. Should all diners be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their food consumption? If not, then I don't see why diners should be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their demand for prime reservations.	12072818	Thu Jun 19 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Restaurant Reservations Be for Sale?

Matt F. Oja	3	0	True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs.

It buys great medical care, great dental care and great dinners. I come from the land of Joe Beef and Au Pied du Cochon and I can see myself buying a table at the last minute but if I don't care when I eat there then I will simply wait for an OpenTable or call.

jimjaf	3	0	this is pretty confusing and seems like sophisticated irrelevance. a restaurant can charge a minimum of $100 for a meal and a movie $20 for a ticket and we don't seem to get upset about the fact that the poor are denied access, but if the meal is $75 and the move $15 and reservations an extra $10 or $3 then there's an equity issue worthy of public debate. In each case the seller has the right to maximize revenue and the buyer (as those of us who buy airline tickets know well) to weigh whether extra charges for priority access are a worthwhile investment.	12074000	Thu Jun 19 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Restaurant Reservations Be for Sale?

The reality is quite the opposite: money is far more authoritative than egalitarian, as those with the most money will always win in this situation. Everyone's greenbacks may be worth the same, but those with more greenbacks will be worth more. Therefore, the current system may be a pain, but it is far more egalitarian in its fairness than a system that allows those with the most money to go to the head of the line."	12070390	Thu Jun 19 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Restaurant Reservations Be for Sale?

Peter B	2	0	As a restaurant owner & operator the idea of selling reservations is problematic, made only worse by the idea that a third party might me making money from the popularity that a restaurant has generated. But as JJ points out, the public has no problem paying less for dining during less desirable hours, why should they be opposed to paying more for prime time? We regularly pay more for better seats at events, but if the price of my menu items increased between 7 & 9 on my busiest nights, or if I charged a premium for my best tables, I would be vilified. Charging a premium for the most desired reservation times seems to be the best free-market solution, but the premium should go to the restaurant,	12105083	Tue Jun 24 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should Restaurant Reservations Be for Sale?

Ajit	6	0	Restricting access is essential since the world population has exploded and the a significant fraction of the National Park visitors are foreigners. The last time I hiked to the top of Half Dome in 2006, it was an awful experience with people falling over each other like in a shopping mall. Same with the hike to Cloud's Rest. I'm glad they introduced the lottery system for Half Dome. If folks really care about spending time in these precious places, they should have to make the early reservations for the most crowded places. I know we live in an instant gratification society, but we got to draw the line somewhere. In any case, there are several excellent Parks where once can go find camping spots on a first-come basis.	18653311	Thu May 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Overcrowded National Parks Have Restricted Access?

I visit Mt Ranier National Park several times as it is almost in my backyard. I am struck by the damage that visitors can inflict on the fragile wild flower meadows in their eagerness and zeal to enjoy the beauty. While better funding and visitor resources such as mass transportation could help, something we can all do is volunteer at a NP for a few days a year. This will go a long way in relieving the already stretched NP resources and the benefit to the volunteer citizen is priceless. Picking up trash, pulling weeks, cataloging wildflowers, roving the meadows helping visitors, etc. can help give back to our country's best idea and recharge our batteries all in one act!!	18648595	Thu May 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Overcrowded National Parks Have Restricted Access?

When I first visited YNP in 1973, the eastern third of the valley was closed to cars and serviced only by the propane powered buses. I remember riding on the roof of the bus in total awe, cruising along quiet roads, getting off at Happy Isles and heading off to Vernal Falls. On a recent summer visits in 2011 and 2014, those same roads have become linear parking lots, with rangers and summer employees working as high-paid parking lot attendants. In other NPs I have seem campgrounds filled up with more or less giant RVs, some running generators in the evening. Zion has set a reasonably good example that could be followed in Yosemite, Bryce, Acadia, and many others. Parks should be for people, not people in vehicles.	18645973	Thu May 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Overcrowded National Parks Have Restricted Access?

Mack	2	0	"""Normally Supreme Court justices should refrain from commenting on partisan politics. But these are not normal times."" And who defines 'normal'? Mr. Butler? So SCOTUS justices should be respectful, impartial bystanders of presidential elections, unless Mr. Butler dislikes that candidate, or decides things aren't 'normal'. In which the SCOTUS can freely brawl in the mud like every other clownish politician. Of course, in these 'abnormal' times, should another justice lash out at Hillary, it's dollars to donuts that Mr. Butler would scream in horror at the indignation and partiality. What a funny sense of justice some people have. Speaking of normal times, the New York Times once published actual news. You know, facts backed with credible sources and evidence. But I guess these aren't normal times, opinions are much flashier and entertaining these days. I suppose Ginsberg's gaffe is a natural evolution of our classless time. And although I'm sure someone will be sorely itching to rattle off Scalia or Thomas and what they did, two wrongs don't make a right do they? The code of conduct should be applicable (and enforced) to ALL judges, including the SCOTUS.

James Ounsworth	10	0	Generally a judge should remain aloof and not engage in politics. But please.... Scalia went off on a number of non-judicial review opinions and nobody said boo. Thomas makes speeches that, thankfully, are not well publicized but nonetheless express his opinions. Does the issue of Justice Ginsburg's views amount to a lead editorial in the NY Times and over 472 comments? I think not. On the other hand, expressing disgust for Trump needs to be done. He is a danger to the US and the world. Don't take him lightly. Be careful. In the UK those in favor of Remaining took the Brexiters too lightly and the UK, if it even stays the UK, will regret that for many years.	19137964	Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Dave	11	0	The basic assumption of the editorial that suggests that Justice Bader Ginsberg needs to remain quite about Trump is that Trump is a normal candidate and these are normal times. Even with broad support of a political party, it is important, vital, moral even, for everyone to call out Trump for what he represents. He represents not democracy, but the corosion of democracy. There has never been a candidate that so clearly neither deserves to be even considered for candidacy let lone to be a candidate. He is hateful, authoritarian, and uses the most base elements of our fears and discomfort against a wall of lies. How dare YOU not call him out w/o the same level of passion and vigor? You have normalized him and that is a crime in and of itself. Where is your critical journalism?	19138122	Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Bob Aceti	8	0	Secular Germans accommodated Hitler during his rise to power by remaining silent. Several of these secular Germans were lawyers, justices and professors. Little did they know that over the course of 10 years - 1935-45, that their Jewish heritage would condemn them and their families, including children to genocide orchestrated by the man they thought would not be able to sway the German people to succeed as Chancellor of Germany. They were wrong. I think Justice Ginsburg has more historic perspective than we care to admit. I don't think, as others have confirmed, that being a Judge precludes one from abdicating one's right to vote and free speech on the candidates that stand for election. Further, if Justice Ginsburg is involved in a case that may present a conflict she would be expected to recuse herself. And that is the more reasonable assessment than the one put forward by the NYT editorial board.	19137971	Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Harry Epstein	7	0	Though Justice Ginsburg has broken precedent with her remarks on Trump, she may be recalling a time when people failed to speak out against political leaders frighteningly similar to Trump and the dire consequences that failure lead to not only for the whole world, but most especially for her people. Though in many ways Trump is a buffoon parody of those leaders, the energies he releases and channels are frighteningly similar to the ones they exploited to work their evil. Perhaps recognizing that, she feels this is one of those moments when precedent must yield to the moral imperative to resist evil.	19136268	Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Doc	3	0	In this particular case, in which the American media and most, if not all, Republicans are showing support for Mister Brand Name, I believe it takes a Supreme Court Justice to help a good half of American to listen, listen, listen to what Brand Name has been saying, and promising, for an entire year. I call this 'Condition Red.' Any decent American, in this case, a Supreme Court Justice, who is frustrated with the 'limp noodle' response to Brand Name's snake-oil method of garnishing support and votes, especially the American media, which seems to have ratings the main priority, any straight-thinking adult voter will have recognized the serious danger of a true despot getting this close to our Presidency. Things are backwards. Instead of acknowledging the farce that is Mister Brand Name, pundits, politicians, and others with eyes, ears, and voices not functioning, should be congratulating Justice Ginsberg instead of spouting rules that they, themselves, flaunt every chance they get.	19129394	Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Maani	10	0	Apparently, everyone needs to see the film Judgment at Nuremberg, based on transcripts of those trials. It is about the trial of a judge and three lawyers who, by either turning a blind eye (the judge) or actively participating with the National Socialists (the lawyers), helped facilitate the legal apparatus of Hitler's Reich. Simply YouTube the judge's (played by Burt Lancaster) astounding speech toward the latter part of the film and you will see that he laments NOT having spoken out when he could sense where things were going. Yes, it is a MOVIE. But it is based on fact - and deals with the rise of the most dangerous demagogue in history (Hitler), for which Trump's rise is an increasingly eerie parallel.	19125556	Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Look at Scalia, and pretend he didn't have a conflict with his hunting buddy, Cheney, and the Paladin type hunting club? Thomas has been involved with some obvious political pushes thru his wife. No conflict? Roberts and Alitho flat out lied in their pre-vote interviews. Stare-Decesious? Position on the constitution and abortion?

There comes a point where decorum, protocol, and tradition have to get left at the curbside of history--if we're going to make any of our own, or have one to talk about in the future. That's what Ginsburg is saying, and that's what Mr. Butler has so eloquently defended."	19124082	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

mj	18	0	There seems to be a lot of confusion in the comments about when a Justice recuses themselves. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but a personally held opinion, even a public statement may not be grounds to recuse oneself. And a Justice only rescues when they are working on a decision that directly involves the subject. In this case Donald Trump. So apparently many of the commenters assume if Donald Trump is elected he will be involved in some breach of law that requires a decision by the SCOTUS? And honestly, Donald Trump has a history of frivolous lawsuits and ridiculous behavior in court. Do you think there are many judges that support this buffoon?	19124050	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

newspaperreader	1	0	Although this distinguished writer is passionate and not necessarily factually wrong, commenting should be a privilege (commenting on elections, public policy, etc) that all federally elected justices give up when accepting a lifetime appointment to the bench. I thoroughly respect Justice Ginsburg for her views and for her lifetime service, but she is not correct here to insert herself into the election. And if Trump were to reply, that too would be wrong--though he most certainly will defend himself. The point of a lifetime appointment is to shield oneself from the political whims of the day and be above the fray (except in opinions, written from a legal basis and not a popular sentiment), and by now commenting, Justice Ginsburg has blown it.	19122808	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

philiphdc	1	0	Having a viewpoint on a person's candidacy is not necessarily a problem. if a case arises out of the election, she is expected to set those opinions aside to evaluate the law and facts. Justices Scalia and Thomas famously had direct and close ties to the Bush campaign. They deemed the ties to not be problematic in Bush v. Gore. Did anyone really wonder if those Justices supported Bush or Gore (or McCain, or Romney...)? In matters other than elections, Justices certainly and routinely have opinions on matters before a case arises before the court -- for example, many of the justices have written memos or articles or even represented clients on subjects such as affirmative action, or the requisite amount of deference to give an agency.	19122544	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Arlene	1	0	Justices are asked questions all the time about cases that may come before the Supreme Court. That is where they have to refrain from issuing opinions prior to testimony. Unless someone is planning to take the Republican Party to Court to prevent them from naming Trump as their candidate for president, there is no reason why Justice Ginsburg should not be able to give her opinion. She can always recuse herself should the case actually materialize, but, I doubt very much that 4 members of the court would ever vote to hear whether or not the Emperor really has New Clothes.	19123010	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Jim Forrester	2	0	Few here seem to realize the one belief all Federal Judges share: The rule of law is first and foremost a tool to serve business. It's part of the reason the Justices often get on so well personally. The letter of the law did not radically change concerning same sex marriage, but the attitudes of the great majority of the citizenry did and doing business became more difficult for companies doing business in states that stubbornly held on to the last century's prejudices. So the Supreme Court had a eureka moment and ruled gay people had the same rights as the rest of the American People. Donald Trump has famously promised, if elected, to use the power of the Oval Office to drag his enemies through the courts. How is that arbitrary application of power to be seen as anything but a descent into corruption and an end to rule of law and the beginning of the rule of tyrants? Do we really want to have to pay off every government official to sell shoes, bake donuts or build cars? Justice Ginsburg does not want that kind of nation, and for one, I'm glad she said so.	19122894	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Emmet Duncan	3	0	In the Canadian legal system - and I suspect the American one is the same - a reasonable apprehension of bias is considered to be as pernicious as an actual bias. Indeed, the test has always been whether a party can establish the former, and not the latter. While few are so naive as to think that justices have no views, it is incomprehensible to me that a justice would enter the fray this way. It is unhelpful generally, and it is detrimental to the Court. It is unhelpful in that I doubt those who lean toward Mr. Trump place much weight on Judge Ginsburg's views to begin with - so she is unlikely to change anyone's mind (especially considering the widely-held anti-elites sentiment that has become so prominent this year). And it is detrimental to a Court that has struggled so much in recent years to combat the view that the Court is every bit as entrenched and political as the rest of the political system is. Judge Ginsburg has given 40-50% of the people every reason to write her off, which ultimately just hurts the institution.	19122484	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

The author likes to call Mr. Trump fascist, among other things, but seems to have no problem with the racist currently ruining the country. If the Supreme court judges have to sit quietly during state of the union speeches than she should shut up now. All she has done was show her bias.

He is a fundamentalist who thinks he only speaks truth. Clinton may have made a mistake, but Trump IS a mistake and is totally opposed to a true democracy, as are those in Congress who want rule by the NRA and not the people.

David Nice	5	0	This uproar is very strange. In 2000, the five most conservative justices voted to, for all practical purposes, pick George W. Bush as president.

casual observer	3	0	Ginsburg's statement has no bearing on the separations of powers nor upon how she will consider cases under review, so I do not think what she said was improper. I do not think that Ginsberg did anything inappropriate since she did not in anyway refer to anything that will ever come before the Supreme Court. The Court has no ability to make any judgments that have any effect upon the election of Presidents nor of who is appointed to the Court. Such a personal opinion will never affect anything that is addressed by the Court. If anything, she is stating something which the mass media is ignoring because it's so caught up in the sport of elections to do any relevant analysis of the foreseeable consequences of who ends up as the next President.	19138566	Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

RB	4	0	The fiction of the court being apolitical is evidenced by innumerable decisions where the court breaks along ideological lines (see: Bush v. Gore).

BK	5	0	It is really a shame how low our expectations have sunk regarding the judiciary. With particular reference to federal judges, it is striking to the degree to which so many Americans do not even desire, let alone expect, these men and women -- entirely unelected and unaccountable to the electorate, by design -- to exercise their awesome and virtually untrammeled power in any sort of remotely objective fashion. Judging from many of these comments, even to suggest that federal judges exercise a modicum of self-restraint or remain behind a facade of neutrality appears to be a bridge too far, or occasions a tit-for-tat exercise at rationalization and justification. How terribly deflating.	19124275	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Steve Singer	17	0	I wasn't aware that Justice Ginsburg automatically surrendered her basic Constitutional rights when she joined the Supreme Court, just as I wasn't aware that President Obama automatically surrendered some of his prerogatives during the final year of his second term simply because it is the final year. I keep looking in the Constitution for the relevant Article or Amendment that declares it so, but fail to find it. Perhaps my research techniques are deficient in some way. Perhaps Sen. McConnell or another Republican political theologian could appraise me of my errors of my ways. Why do Republican Senators believe themselves entitled to re-design the American political system, especially how it works to better suit their partisan purposes while out of power? And why do they justify their institutional encroachments by offering entirely new interpretations of the Constitution that were neither envisioned nor adopted by the Framers nor debated and ratified by Congress and the States? Are those better questions for Professor Gillers to ponder than whether Justice Ginsburg spoke out of turn, or whether her desire not to play mute swan in a golf course pond offends tender Republican sensitivities.	19123995	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

GH	5	0	Why would anyone think that judges are kept out of politics? On many state or country levels they are flat-out elected. The ones who are appointed are often on the receiving end of political reward. Even Federal appointments are political footballs these days, note wellhow many of Obama's picks have been hung out to dry.

Jim Forrester	5	0	Judges are not umpires. If Mr. Trump acted out in a ball game like he has for most of his life, including calling a judge whom he is before biased due to his heritage, if he had so accused an umpire, he would have been thrown out of that particular game and possibly have his career as a player ended for the good of the game. Mr. Trump campaigns proudly on his scorn for the rule of law (unless it's applied in his favor). How is any jurist not to think him unfit? How is a jurist in her role as citizen not to speak out when Trump casts himself as the enemy of the rule of law?	19122212	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Guy	7	0	Wow. After a quick skim of the comments, there seems to be a consensus that past examples of breaches of judicial ethics justify any current breach. Apparently rational thought, such as expressed by Professor Gillers in this eloquent and well reasoned piece, is simply no longer applicable to today's issues. The gut reaction partisans appear to have won the day, at least for this turn of the wheel of history. Expediency is the rule. Rule of law? At least trying to maintain the appearance of an unbiased judiciary? Nah. Every past transgression justifies any present outrage. Back to the age of barbarism. Unbelievable.

Andrew	5	0	"The Chief Justice's analogy to a baseball umpire was terrible then and it's still terrible now. Yes, judges normally call judicial balls and strikes. They accept the playing field as level and then apply the rules to whatever controversy arises between the players. But the whole point of having a Supreme Court is to decide what happens when the playing field isn't level. What happens, for example, when one of the players can't even get inside the stadium because he's black? Or when the players bet on the game? What happens when the game's basic integrity is at issue? That's when Supreme Court justices earn their paycheck, and that's when saying ""my job's to call balls and strikes"" is a meaningless cop out. All of which is to say, good for Justice Ginsburg for refusing to ignore reality."	19122372	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

jwp-nyc	4	0	If Mr. Gillers could explain then how and why it is that judges run for their seats on the NY Supreme Court and are elected by the popular vote after paying set amounts in political contributions to their local party leader, I would be most enlightened. Seriously? Gillers must be joking. Judges have always been political - but that is apart from the reason and logic required to fashion a legal opinion that will stand on the law and survive appeal, as he well knows. Judge Ginsberg has every right to voice her opinion regarding the fitness of Donald Trump for the highest office in the land. And if Trump fears anything it is the weight of any opinion that does not bend in fealty to his psychopathy.	19123333	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

The surreality of his vision of the judicial role as that of an 'objective' umpire has long been clear, emphatically since the Court's scandalous intellectual prostitution in Bush vs. Gore. Lying to the public about the all too human nature of judges and courts will only add to our cynicism as each nakedly biased opinion rolls out. Better to admit that objectivity, elusive in any setting, is unavailable to judges, creatures beholden to political forces at every stage of their careers.

Daydreamer	15	0	Please, a Republican controlled Senate will ensure that any nominee put forth by a Democratic president is not too far left and vice versa. The courts will always be packed with judges who interpret the law one way or the other. Justice Ginsberg has made some extraordinary statements in the past week regarding Donald Trump, a man who has continuously shown outright contempt for our rule of law. It is my belief that Trumps rhetoric is genuine. This is not the typical say-anything to get elected scenario. He will be worse if elected. Many, if not most Republicans are equally concerned. But even if Trump is elected, nothing about Ruth Bader Ginsberg will change. He will get the same exact justice she is today, although she may fight more vigilantly with her more conservative peers. With all that in mind, I think her comments were fine.	19122473	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

John Smith	16	0	NOWHERE did Justice Ginsburg make any political statement whatsoever. She is stating a hypothetical, which is something that happens constantly in courts and in legal discussions every day. Hypothetically, if Trump were elected, she would hypothetically be confused, wish to leave the US and hypothetically wish to live in another country. Now had any judge said, I would advise any sane person to vote against Trump or to remain in the US if he's elected, that would clearly constitute political speech advising others and would most likely be unacceptable. Whether it were legal or not depends on the context. In conversations with family members and close friends, Justices are afforded the same rights of free speech as anyone else. Beyond that, speaking of hypotheticals is the safest choice.	19120098	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

The author is concerned about maintaining the judiciary's ""umpire"" role, but the legitimacy of our government is being jeopardized. If ever there was a time to take the unusual step of direct criticism, this is it. Her frank acknowledgment of her own mortality and that of her fellow Justices is almost a sad metaphor for the rule of law in this country should Trump come to power (i.e., its days are numbered). Giving Trump the power to appoint even 1 Justice would, in the ""best"" case scenario, reignite the GOP's shameless attempts to undermine every right that doesn't involve a church, a gun or a corporation. Now consider that he might be empowered to appoint 2 (3?) during his time in office.

kagni	2	0	If Justice Ginsburg feels that Trump's candidacy, and potential winning of the Presidency, endangers the rule of law, since he does not follow, or even know, the Constitution, isn't it her duty to speak up? As has been pointed out, Trump already shuts down the access of unsympathetic press. Should he be elected, do you expect him to respect the opposition?

Norman Rudman	4	0	The Times editorial board confuses political and legal issues in its criticism of Justice Ginsburg. The Supreme Court does not decide political issues. It has based many refusals to consider such issues on its determination that they are political in nature. There is, therefore, no breach of legal ethics when a Justice voices an opinion on a matter of politics. Nothing is more political in nature than the fitness of a candidate to be president, and accordingly, Justice Ginsburg was both within her First Amendment rights as a citizen and the principles of judicial ethics to express her opinion.	19140254	Thu Jul 14 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Wordsworth from Wadsworth	15	0	Justice Ginsberg has the right of free speech also. That's the first thing I thought. Her thoughts on Merrick Garland were very appropriate. The Senate refusing to have a confirmation hearing under the Obama administration is an outrage. More than that, not having Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court is a wasted opportunity for our country. If you are acquainted with the legal system, you can appreciate the years of hard work Judge Garland has put in honing his redoubtable intellect. In addition, he has already provided a lifetime of public service. He richly deserves to be on the Supreme Court. The United States would be a better place.

New Zealand was recently on my mind, and a young woman told me that it was extremely difficult to achieve Citizenship. The other evening, feeling depressed about the course of our Nation, I wondered why Merrick Garland has still not been appointed. Trump, in himself, does not strike me as dangerous, but placing our hope in this once implausible 'phenomenon' makes some of us edgy, uncomfortable and unconsoled. Ms. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is exemplary and extraordinary, but she was not lying once in a cradle, thinking that one day she would be serving on the Supreme Court.

Herodotus	5	0	Has a Supreme Court Justice in the entire history of the United States ever publicly criticized a presidential candidate? Perhaps I'm wrong but I know of no such instance even during the most divisive period of American life, the Civil War. Justice Taney, for example, never publicly took Lincoln to task, though Lincoln often eviscerated his Dred Scott decision. Nor did Marshall rip into Jefferson though he despised him and said so many times -- privately, that is. What Ginsburg did was disgraceful. I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray. Would those who support Ginsburg's public comments about Trump also support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out in favor of his election? I strongly doubt it. Indeed, they would probably demand his scalp and they would be right to do so.	19122993	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

John Smith	47	0	JUDGES, I believe, are speaking within their rights as citizens, when they refer to past cases, including those which they participated in. Speaking of candidate Merrick Garland, Justice Ginsburg has a perfect right to state the fact that his nomination is being held up. And to express her frustration that he has not been given a fair hearing. Without indicating her views of his specific qualifications, experience and judicial decisions. She is also entitled to allude to part of her past decisions, for example as in observing that her doubts about the Citizens' United case were accurate indicators of the risks involved the impact of the verdict on the US electoral process. All ex post facto statements. The case is not before her. Given the prima donna stunts exhibited by the late great Diva Scalia, especially in his callous disregard for judicial propriety, in my opinion in going duck hunting with Chainy while inovlved in an active case before the Supreme Court. Even that was not found to be unethical, though in my opinion it was pushing the envelope.	19120259	Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Can a Supreme Court Justice Denounce a Candidate?

Kyle W	6	0	It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course. If it doesn't work, then we will course correct.	12018473	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Bari	10	0	As long as school boards hire and promote administrators based on political cronyism, patronage, nepotism, religious and ethnic affiliation, gender, race, sexual orientation and any other specious criteria and considerations, teachers will always need the basic protections provided by tenure. Good administrators who know how to objectively evaluate teachers learn to work within the tenure system to deal with ineffective teachers. Lazy administrators who rely on complaints from parents made through their connections to school board members employ tactics designed to intimidate, demean, frighten and coerce unwanted teachers to voluntarily resigning. Those tactics rarely work. As a result performance and morale further deteriorate, and the entire school community suffers.	12017879	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

View from the hill	14	0	In response to people who ask what's different about teaching: Teaching is different from the usual at-will jobs because of the political element. In the absence of job protection, it is very easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, for putting Huckleberry Finn on the syllabus, etc. As for the judge's statement that it takes a decade and hundreds of thousands of dollars to fire a bad teacher, that may be because of a particularly onerous set of state laws in California, but that alone doesn't make tenure as a general principle wrong. Most due process issues are in the union contract terms, not state law, and union contracts are negotiable.	12017622	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Todd Stuart	12	0	There is nothing in this opinion that explains why teachers need more protections than other civil servants or the private work force at large. There are legal protections and remedies that all employees have against prejudicial firing. We are dealing with public school teachers, not college professors researching controversial topics who might need special protections. The minute number of teachers actually fired for cause speaks for itself. Additionally the argument that reducing tenure will hurt morale might be true for the bad teachers who jobs are at risk. But how do you think the current system affects the moral of good teachers who year after year see the same basket case co-workers keep their jobs.

In fact, without the benefit of negotiated job protections or statutory dismissal procedures, like those overturned in Vergara, teachers may be fired for any number of reasons that are discriminatory or capricious, and completely unrelated to job performance. Is a 39 year old, 15-year teacher costing too much on the salary schedule? Then give them the ax. The ADEA does not apply to employees under the age of 40, even if they are expressly terminated because of age. Did a teacher blow the whistle on an unsavory practice at school, related to their job? Well, under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), that teacher may not have any First Amendment protection for that speech. And gay, lesbian and transgender teachers have no federal protection from discrimination unless and until our Congress passes ENDA. Until then, such discrimination is perfectly legal in many states.

Pamela Michaels	6	0	One very good reason for tenure - aside from monetary benefits - IS for the children. In a chaotic world, getting more chaotic all the time, children need continuity and structure to focus on learning and some sense of security that the people who care about them will be there. Schools......aren't.......businesses........at least, they shouldn't be. If a school were run the way all the deformers would have it, there would be a revolving door of teachers in and out every 2 - 3 years, based on who is getting the polished apples or not. Schools communities would be even less cohesive than they are now as colleagues will be less and less inspired to model cooperation among the staff.	12020196	Fri Jun 13 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Katherine Cagle	11	0	No, don't abolish tenure, just make it more effective by giving tenure only after 4 or 5 years. Teach principals how to deal with ineffective teachers -- how to document, step up observations and evaluations, how to dismiss teachers who are not effective. The problem is that most principals don't know the difference between good and bad teachers. In my 36 years working in schools I observed that the principal usually praised the teachers who most often agreed with and flattered them. Yes, teachers usually do stay in the same job, maybe not in the same location, and it's a good thing if they do. I worked in 5 different schools over my career and the most effective schools had a good mixture of experienced and new teachers. The experienced teachers helped new teachers with discipline and techniques they had learned over the years. The new teachers added new ideas and new theories of education.

Peter Schaeffer	6	0	The focus on tenure is just another simplistic approach to changing our educational system. The judge also overlooked that tenure can help attract teachers. Living in West Virginia, a state with many small and isolated communities, why would any teacher without personal ties to our state come here, if she can fired at will? I know that I and my wife would not.	12015970	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Paz	2	0	What makes teachers so special that they need tenure? There are too many stories of bad teachers being simply transferred or being put on leave before being transferred. If they are lousy, then fire them. There are plenty of people who would take those jobs and crazy benefits (12 months of pay for 9 months of work plus every holiday under the sun). They can't get these jobs because the unions are all about who you know, whether it's teaching in a nice town, or trying to get a job at the docks. The whole notion of seniority over skills is nonsense as well. If you're good at your job, you get to keep it.	12014398	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Jeff Kology	10	0	Tenure was never intended to protect incompetent teachers. Tenure was intended to be the necessary protection for teachers who give their professional (or political) opinion. In states where teacher tenure is abolished, it is replaced with the policy that a principal or superintendent may dismiss a teacher at the end of a school year without having to give a reason or any justification whatsoever. This system creates yes-men and women -- zombies who do exactly as told and live in fear of giving an honest, professional opinion on what may be considered by some to be the curriculum or program that administrators tout as being the ultimate answer to education reform. Who would take that risk?	12014246	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Eric	5	0	Yeah, about what I expected from Petrilli. An attempt to seem reasonable by minimizing the problems with his position and overstating the benefits. Yes, an arbitrarily fired teacher without tenure can sue, and might possibly collect... IF he or she can afford a lawyer, and IF he or she can make it through years of litigation without a job. Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so. It's stupidly simple: tenure is basically a law that says teachers, after several years of service, need to be informed of the reason they're being fired and given a chance to respond to those accusations. Despite a lot of really misleading claims, that's really all it is. And since that system protects good teachers and allows the firing of bad ones, nobody who understands it (and wants the best for kids) will oppose it.	12013181	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Young teachers, especially in the most challenging urban districts need support and mentoring. The high turnover rate will only get higher if this new ruling prevails.

flydoc	17	0	In order to attract and retain people to teaching, they need to have some positive benefit in the profession. When the top 25 hedge fund managers make more money than all the nation's kindergarten teachers combined, you know teachers aren't well paid. The only thing they have is the assurance that they can't be fired on a whim. There is a trade-off between salary and security, and taking one away without increasing the other is going to bleed the profession still further.	12013086	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Chester	1	0	"""K-12 teachers with tenure do not have a job for life. What ""tenure"" means, for them, is due-process procedures for dismissals with cause, instead of capricious or at-will dismissal from their duties."" If that were the case, then I don't think the union busters like Welch would have such an easy time finding popular support. Most thoughtful people would support tenure if it did simply mean due process. But it is so hard to dismiss bad teachers and children's educations suffer. Dismissing all protections isn't fair, but the teacher's unions brought this upon themselves by refusing to entertain any flexibility with regard to evaluations and dismissals."	12011066	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Charles	4	0	Tenure does not mean a teacher cannot lose their job. It requires due process before termination. Before tenure is achieved, a teacher can be fired without due process.

Without tenure and due process, teachers risked being fired if they didn't follow instructions.	12019731	Fri Jun 13 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Casual Observer	2	0	Making teachers more vulnerable to termination is bound to cause them to begin to actually try to teach. Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.	12017115	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

Eric	12	0	Everytime Hanushek mentions research, watch out. The research he manages to find always seems to reinforce his preferred narrative, no matter how little it resembles reality. Back in reality, tenure is basically a rule that allows the firing of bad teachers while prohibiting the firing of good ones. Like any rule implemented by human beings, it can be derailed by incompetent supervisors, but the rule itself doesn't protect bad teachers. It protects good ones. Ending tenure doesn't make it any easier for a competent administrator to fire a bad teacher, but it DOES make it easier for an incompetent administrator to fire a GOOD teacher. Hanushek is rarely on the right side of issues, and he doesn't surprise here.	12013230	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

I was in 4 different schools and in all that time I had only 1 supervisor whom I would think understood what I was doing. They did not know that I still have a file of letters from parents and student teachers thanking me for all I did for the children. But I returned to 1 school, and the principal was delighted. But he made the mistake of not informing the ass't principal. From the 1st day of school she harassed me in many ways.I am not talented in rebuffels and the prin. said it was not in his jurisdiction to interfere.she kept it up. She won. I retired. The teachers had the 1st end of year party in 8 yrs. just to honor me. I think that in the 1st 3 yrs of teaching bad teachers can be identified and dismissed before tenure; good teacher should be protected from bad supevisors and sheer personal pettiness.	12009673	Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Tenure Protect Bad Teachers or Good Schools?

There is a lot of tax-payer money which is trying to counter this, but the money, which is on account of the governments are just peanuts. The german industry is steamrolling the rest of europe, and for this devastation everyone has to pay, first of all the german tax-payers. Just look at france, their demise is now on the lever. Where should this end ? A few countries with a workforce of 50 Mio is liable for producing the need of 350 Mio citizen ? But the main problem are political and social issues. This is a conundrum, the moral hazard - unlike the US every country is liable for their own efficiency.

This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000.

Dan Stackhouse	15	0	"Here's the deal with home birth as opposed to hospital birth. From this essay, ""Life-threatening emergencies that are not predictable are extremely rare - although they do occur both at home and in the hospital at roughly equal rates."" So when a life-threatening emergency occurs at a hospital, the mother and baby have a pretty good chance of surviving it, or as good as possible anyway. When such occurs at home, the odds are good that the mother and/or baby will die. So home births are less safe. They're usually safe, sure, because these emergencies are rare. But they're less safe than hospitals and always will be."	14227993	Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is Home Birth Ever a Safe Choice?

Unneeded interventions and drugs, artificially induced labours, humiliating practices like shaving pubic hair, twilight sleep, episiotomies, Caesareans scheduled for the convenience of the doctor and his golf game, women with previous Caesareans not allowed to attempt a VBAC, babies and mothers separated at birth. If you're wondering why some women would want a home birth, take a look at yourselves and your practices.	14229844	Tue Sep 15 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Home Birth Ever a Safe Choice?

Cynthia Kegel	2	0	How large is the (significant) difference between outcomes for a baby born at home and one born in the hospital? And, is it due to the inclusion in this data of incompetent midwives? I have known several women who gave birth at home, and wished to do so myself, but couldn't because of complications. My experience of birthing in a hospital with a male resident was quite unpleasant. He touched me and examined me without asking my permission. He said my membranes had not broken and I was urinating. Every woman who has experienced membranes breaking knows the difference. A woman/midwife wouldn't have done/said these things this. Childbirth is difficult enough without unempathic male doctors.	14229819	Tue Sep 15 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Home Birth Ever a Safe Choice?

cls	2	0	"It's really tiresome to hear all these male obstetricians (not that the female ones are much better in this regard) make remarks like ""oh yes, we should be doing a better job"" of making hospital birth safer, with fewer C-sections and better outcomes -- and less trauma -- for mothers and babies, etc. If they really cared about ""doing a better job"" they would have been working towards changing the hospital environment and protocols already, and they're not. Very little has changed for the better and in fact c-section rates continue to rise. (And increasingly obstetricians have *less* training now in techniques such as vaginal breech delivery, forceps delivery, VBAC . . .) I'm really not seeing this urge to do ""a better job"" that they keep talking about. They are patronizing and dismissive towards trained and knowledgeable midwives and towards women with real concerns. Also, the attempt by these commentators to equate advocates of homebirth with ""anti-vaxxers"" and ""junk science"" is rather scurrilous. The circumstances and practices involved, and the quality of argument and evidence in each case, are not equivalent."	14227618	Tue Sep 15 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Home Birth Ever a Safe Choice?

Tony Stone	2	0	This is a pretty offensive and inaccurate view. To compare home birthers to vaccine deniers is absurd. Hospitals have an increasing rate of cesarian births, which pose an increase risk to the mother, with 3 times the mortality rate of a vaginal birth. Transfer rates of home births are about 2-3%, meaning there is about a 97-98% chance of a vaginal birth for a baby born at home, a far safer option for the mother. Here are a couple facts to balance out these doctors inaccurate and out of date views: From the CDC: Number of vaginal deliveries: 2,642,892 Number of Cesarean deliveries: 1,284,339 Percent of all deliveries by Cesarean: 32.7% From Wikipedia: In those who are low risk the risk of death for Caesarian sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world. The UK National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth	14225361	Tue Sep 15 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Is Home Birth Ever a Safe Choice?

Amanda	21	0	This is a wonderful article. I have had 3 births, the first 2 were in the hospital, and my 3rd was at home. I had awful experiences in the hospital with feeling like my freedom was taken away. I felt like I was shackled to the bed from the moment I walked in. My home birth was by far the best decision I have ever made. The experience is almost indescribable. Don't get me wrong, my first 2 births are special to me only because it was the moment my beautiful children came into this world. I just wish I knew then what I know now. With my home birth, I had an absolutely wonderful midwife who monitored me, but also aloud me to have control and let my body do what it was meant to do: give birth. Pregnancy is not a sickness, and I refuse to allow it to be treated as such.	14230144	Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is Home Birth Ever a Safe Choice?

Northstar5	13	0	The solution to the risks posed by hospitals is not to move procedures into the home, but to aggressively work on reducing the risks and improving hospital settings. No one would have a triple bypass in their living room just because they are more likely to get an infection in the hospital. The risk of infection is being addressed: a major campaign in many hospitals has successfully reduced the risk, and that is the right direction. Move forward, not backward.	14230061	Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is Home Birth Ever a Safe Choice?

Jonathan Katz	8	0	This opinion made sense in the days before Semmelweis, when hospitals were unsanitary and mothers contracted fatal infections there. But that was over 150 years ago.

Dee	10	0	"Another male obstetrician with scare tactics designed to intimidate women from having their baby at home. Women with high-risk pregnancies know they need to deliver in a hospital and may need surgical intervention. Many women do not. Saying ""We can do a better job of bringing the comforts of home into a controlled birth setting"" shows he just doesn't get it. It's not about painting the walls of the delivery room a pretty color or having rocking chairs in the room. It's about informed and healthy women in control of their birth choices. Let us be clear, this guy's lifestyle is based on insisting that women deliver in hospital attended by a surgeon.

Fatih gul	7	0	Kurds are very reliable ally of United States in the Middle East. They do not have any connection with any extremist Islamic group and they are the only group that have been fighting against Isis consistently. In other hand Turkey not only allow many cihadists to use their border to join Isis but also support extremist group in Syria in order to remove the Essad from the power. Turkey never committed to fight against Isis. It allowed US to use its air base last year against Isis but they decided to use that opportunity to bomb Kurdish territories both in Syria and Iraq. How Us can relay on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is using his power to get rid of democratic society. There are many journalists in jail, 1028 academicians were charged because they signed a petition to invite Turkish government to have a peace in southeast Turkey.

Alex	4	0	I see a trend here. A series of Turkish supporters of the islamofascist AKP party of Turkey who are paid by the Sultan (Erdogan) to discredit the Kurds and harness support for the now Islamic Republic of Turkey (the Sunni version of Iran). This is of course not a big deal in the Middle East and I wouldn't expect anything else from the major media outlets based in that region. However, little did I know that NYT would allow for these AKP trolls to be published on the platform of such a respected site. Whatever these trolls say, and whatever the mainstream media wants to spam people with, the truth will remain the same: 1. Turkey has left their 50 year old history of secularism and gone back to their 1000 year history of radical islam to re-establish the Ottoman Empire. 2. The Kurds are one of the few people in this region who are Western-oriented and wish to establish a democratic pluralistic society. For this, Western powers should step away from the status quo that has brought nothing but civil war and what seems to be a perpetual low-grade conflict and instead support an independent Kurdistan.	17686396	Thu Feb 25 00:00:00 CET 2016	Are Kurds Allies or Obstacles in Syria?

Mark Thomason	6	0	This author is the head of the Turkish government's lobby in DC. It is about as independent as AIPAC, and structured much the same. This sees Kurds as the problem, and blames them for the absurd. That is the Turkish position, defeating Kurds first, last, and always the priority. Some of this is total nonsense. The Kurds are not aligned with any of the rebels fighting Assad. They made a deal with Assad a long time ago for autonomy in return for keeping the rebels out of the areas Assad agreed were theirs. That is what the Turks hate in this -- Kurdistan. Any yes, they cooperate with the Russians, because they are defined by their deal with Assad. Yes, they will fight ISIS with the US, because ISIS threatens to take from them parts of their intended Kurdistan. That is one thing ISIS does which Turkey supports, reducing Kurdistan. This author's venom must be understood in this light.	17693794	Thu Feb 25 00:00:00 CET 2016	Are Kurds Allies or Obstacles in Syria?

Mulgarat	3	0	Of course the YPG have been coordinating with the Russians, so has the United States! Moderate rebels? Seriously? Just because the Rebels opposing the Syrian Democratic Forces are backed by Turkey does that make them moderate? The Kurdish led coalition with Arabs and Syriac-Assyrians want to create a secular democracy within the borders of an autonomous region in a land otherwise ruled by terror. Is that such a bad thing? The whole point of war is to seize territory from those that are trying to kill you. Always has been all ways will. Two years ago the Kurds were almost pushed outside the borders of Syria and faced genocide, they will not let that happen again.

Karekin	12	0	Mr. Lister is clearly exhibiting his biases and obfuscating facts. Firstly, the so-called 'Syrian' opposition is and has been all along, largely made up of non-Syrians, imported into Syria for the sole purpose of regime change. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, most of the opposition is made up of ultra-religious jihadi groups, affiliated with al-Qaeda and others. It defies comprehension that anyone in the Western intelligentsia or media would advocate any of these groups over Assad or the government of Syria, or the Kurds who are opposed to all of these groups. What is the game plan here? Is it ISIS and/or jihadi control of Syria, governed b the invisible hand of Saudi Arabia, which is not known for its democratic tendencies? If so, you should go live with the 'opposition' and see how long you last.	17679477	Wed Feb 24 00:00:00 CET 2016	Are Kurds Allies or Obstacles in Syria?

We have all witnessed historically what happened during prohibition when the government deemed alcohol evil and a family wrecker.

Dee	4	0	Hollow argument. I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few. The answer is to limit the number of alcoholic beverages per person during happy hour. It would be a good idea at sporting events too, but the team owners and concessionaires would never allow that.	15344547	Sat Jun 27 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Should Happy Hour Be Banned?

They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while. If you have time, make day trips.	6537714	Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Family Vacations Worth It?	Should parents soldier forth and try to create those irreplaceable family memories?

vibise	7	0	When our kids were little, we made the obligatory trip to Disneyworld, but we coupled that with a trip to the Kennedy Space Center to watch a shuttle launch. We also took them on a driving tour of New England to see things like Mystic Seaport, Plimouth Plantation and Salem. When they got older we took them to the Grand Canyon, Europe and Japan, but they helped plan our vacations and so we made side trips to Meteor Crater and Legoland in Windsor. The kids are now grown and living in different states, but they still ask to take family vacations with us. These trips a good way to reconnect, but it is also clear they have given our kids first hand knowledge and real appreciation of the wider world.	6537087	Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Family Vacations Worth It?

Demetroula	2	0	Parents can start by disconnecting from their own social networking addictions and not diving into their cell phones every 3 minutes. Leave work and the world behind! Parents need to genuinely interact with their children, otherwise what's the point of taking the family somewhere new if everyone is simply bringing along their own 'entertainment bubble'? Take children to where they can really interact with real people or nature, not the plasticised, calorific worlds of ghastly theme parks and the like. For city kids especially, how about a farm vacation, where they can see how food is raised?	6536277	Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Family Vacations Worth It?

SES	3	0	"In 1959 or so our family took an epic car trip around New York State and Connecticut. My brother, sister, and I still talk about that trip - good memories. My wife and I always took our kids on vacations. We all had a great time and I hope that their memories of these trips is as fond as ours are. Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family.

marian	4	0	I have very very happy memories of family vacations with the kids- and would not change those for the world. Perhaps the difference is the kids were well behaved? From looking at these posts, it seems alot of parents are extremely anxious to get away from their children. I think getting away for a romantic weekend sans children is great- but for big 2 week summer vacations, I would find it unthinkable to go without the children and to have them miss this experience. I would think this sends a message to the kids that you really don't like them very much- perhaps theyre right.	6539424	Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Family Vacations Worth It?

oldgreymare	3	0	When a couple decides to have children, the children become an integral part of the family and should not be excluded from family adventures unless a child has so severe a disability that he or she cannot go. We rarely took vacations, but when we did it was as a family. Now that our children are grown and all moved away, we seldom see them, so those together times have become even more precious. Children grow up so fast--enjoy them as much as you can. Carve out time for yourselves by enforcing an early bedtime for the offspring.	6538888	Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Family Vacations Worth It?

ErinA	19	0	I agree with the poster who said there's no one-size approach to this question. My ideal solution would be to take a vacation without the kids ~and~ the husband. Of course, you don't know my family. You think that's heartless and selfish until I explain that I live with the exasperating reality of a husband with mental illness and five step-kids two of whom also have mental illness, who spend the majority of their time with a mom who has very low standards for her own behavior let alone theirs. Yeah, I know- it's my bed, I'll lie in it. But a couple nights to lie in it alone would be nice.	6538107	Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Are Family Vacations Worth It?

stuart	5	0	In Europe, France and Britain have nuclear weapons. The industrial and financial driver of the continent, Germany, does not. That might not bode well for future stability. There is always the possiblity of nationalist revanchism. While the USSR is gone, Russia's strategic interest in a relatively disarmed Germany is most likely not. Having the US pull out of NATO at this point--where all appears stable for the time being at least--without having a final resolution of the armaments issue, seems less than fully prudent.	8842255	Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Has NATO Outlived Its Usefulness?

achilles13	1	0	For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems	8841900	Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Has NATO Outlived Its Usefulness?

Vincent Amato	8	0	I would assume that the only group opposed to our leaving NATO are those element of the military industrial complex that profit financially from our continued participation. Beyond the savings in dollars, there are two significant advantages in doing so. First, it would trend against the reality of empires falling as a result of overextending themselves militarily, and second, it would go a long way toward bringing Russia back into the community of European nations, ending a major source of Russian paranoia. Unfortunately, this move makes so much sense that it is unlikely the present congress would entertain it.	8840022	Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Has NATO Outlived Its Usefulness?

Babeouf	2	0	NATO's decline is irreversible. It serves no European defence needs at all. From time to time it may involve itself in some US Imperial adventure. Or provide cover for some latter day petty European Imperial foray into Africa. There is no Russian threat at all. And no prospect of using NATO as a backstop in the US pivot to confront the inexorable rise of China. Indeed for Europe there is no Chinese threat unless Russia joins a Chinese axis. And in this case NATO is unlikely to be an adequate tool for the brave new world. such an alliance would portend. NATO serves the interests of the US regime and consequently they must bear the financial costs. If the US government doesn't want to pay the bill let it leave. What keeps the US paying is not some positive commitment to democracy,human rights or the American way it is (and quite obviously) fear. The fear of being on your own with only the Israeli government to act as your friend in need.	8838057	Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Has NATO Outlived Its Usefulness?

Anon	2	0	Amen. Entangling alliances may be necessary when there is an existential threat to national survival (Hitler & friends, expansionist Warsaw Pact), but there is no such threat now. It is not our job to police the world, resolve conflict in the Middle East, or protect Europe -- which can look after itself just fine in a way that it could not immediately post WWII. Attempting to enforce some sort of Pax Americana is not our responsibility, nor is it our right, and we reap more resentment than peace when we act as if it is.	8838287	Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Has NATO Outlived Its Usefulness?

Dave	3	0	Gaps in European military spending for what threat? Terrorism, by and large, is a law enforcement and intelligence agency problem. It's been used by those who didn't know what to focus on after the end of the cold war as an excuse to continue to play the same old games they were familiar with from the cold war. The USA can no longer afford to p,at the role of world policeman, and Europe - which faces no credible threat of military invasion-can and should provide for its own military needs. The cold war mentality got the USA into too many problems it should never have gotten into - Korea, Vietnam, desert storm, and the two Bush wars. We should disband NATO and while we are at it ask ourselves why are we defending south Korea and Japan? Like Europe these are two rich nations that could defend themselves. Besides the endless waste of money, would anyone reading this think the lives of their son or daughter is worth defending south Korea? It's not 1950 anymore.

S.L.	3	0	It is impossible to get a good sampling from polls. Poll takers are like telemarketers; they invade the privacy of our homes, especially when we are busiest. If I answer the phone at all, I am apt to be less than polite to the person who is bothering me. I have strong political opinions but the poll takers will never hear them because I don't want to answer a stranger's probing questions. What kinds of people are being sampled? I am not alone in my feelings about intrusive phone calls, so it is none of us. Although I have had a few illegal calls on my cell phone, those without landlines are not included in most samples. The skewed sampling is giving greater weight to the candidate whose fans are willing to be bothered by a poll. What does that say about his qualifications for the job of president? Nothing.	16807537	Tue Dec 01 00:00:00 CET 2015	Does Polling Undermine Democracy?	Have public opinion surveys been given too great a role in American politics?

Entropic	11	0	I would tend to agree: Poll results (no matter how ill formed the poll questions) create a public narrative that exists outside of any rigorous definition of reality. This is very much like the artificial Red State / Blue State divide, when in fact most states are clearly purple. But polls tell us Texas is full of tea party nuts, and Massachusetts the lair of well meaning but totally impractical socialists and Harvard pontificators. And ne'er the twain shall meet. This is, of course, a dangerous way to conduct public dialogue, and I lay a lot of the blame on the press, which refuses to call the idiocy of some of these polls out. The fourth estate needs to step back and find some voices of reason.	16803626	Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2015	Does Polling Undermine Democracy?

Dave	1	0	"I agree with this, and I would add that I think they can even change the results with their questions. Undoubtedly some policers either have polled or will poll the question, ""Do you think Bernie Sanders can win the election?"" A lot of people are more interested in this kind of question than questions of real policy, because it gives them a chance to feel like an expert on the subject of politics. The obvious correct answer is no, so most people will say no. But that question is biassed by existing poll numbers. Nobody knows who can win, but everyone wants to think they know because they like predictability. Asking the question and publicizing the results plants in the people's minds the idea that a voter's judgement about whether a candidate can win or not is an important factor in voting. It isn't. It is a factor that should not even be considered by most voters. They should vote for the person they want to win, period."	16800238	Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2015	Does Polling Undermine Democracy?

Urizen	2	0	This is sad: basically, the argument presented here is that public opinion polls help our representatives understand how we feel on a particular issue. The truth is, politicians use poll results to craft their campaign rhetoric - and once elected, ignore the polls and focus on the needs of the powerful which they obtain at dinner parties, on the golf course and through lobbyists. Just look at the numerous polls showing broad public support for policies which the rich veto: a national health plan, increased Social Security benefits, increased taxation of wealth, ending austerity etc.	16804124	Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2015	Does Polling Undermine Democracy?

child of babe	2	0	This response reflects my views as well. Polls are a political tool for politicians, not a democratic vehicle where people can voice their opinions and know that it will matter. It is much easier for a pollster to get a higher rate of return with simple questions that require yes/no answers. Thus, should an interviewer encounter someone with a more nuanced view or deeper understanding, those responses are far less likely to be included, let alone even documented. Interviewers generally get paid by the number of completed surveys. Thus polls would tend to reflect the attitude of the least educated and least critical thinkers among us. Sorry if that sounds condescending. By then reflecting - after the usually poorly worded and biases questions are asked - those opinions, the polls then contribute to the dumbing down of America.	16800018	Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2015	Does Polling Undermine Democracy?

Andrew	1	0	I believe too much emphasis is being place on voter turnout, and not enough emphasis is being placed on education. Is a low unemployment rate a good thing? Yes. Is a high rate of education a good thing? Yes. Is a high voter turnout a good thing? Well, quite frankly that depends. Why is it high? Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus. If we succeed in better educating the American people, voter turnout should naturally go up, providing a good indicator of how well we are doing.	14454659	Thu Mar 19 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

peterb	1	0	I found Professor Brennan's view elitist and arrogant. He has been fortunate enough to have had an education and now sits in judgement on those whom he perceives as to stupid to vote, and as he politely intimates would spoil his nice little educated democracy. Mandatory voting does not mean you actually have to vote, it just means you have to attend the polling booth on election day. As Eric Walk (17) mentioned many citizens have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that you have that privilege, is it too much to ask that those enjoying the benefits of that sacrifice show their respect on election day by participating in what is and has been fought and died for, regardless of your level of formal education. Would Professor Brennan suggest that those in the armed services are also of a similar level of intelligence? Or is it alright that those who belong to the lowest socioeconomic group in the US continue to do the lion's share of the fighting and dying for his right to vote as has been the case since the Vietnam War.	4864494	Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

Jarstfer	1	0	The fact Bush got elected twice and Perry several times in Texas proves the point that people don't vote using informed decisions. But that said, democracy requires the active participation of the people. Just making everyone informed is not the answer as information itself can be controlled. It is also hard to swallow that voters need to be informed. Heck, the right wing politicians these days are not informed. Maybe start there.

Mike R	1	0	"Contrary to popular belief, there is no mandatory voting in Australia. Adults are required to attend a polling station, to produce identification, and to have their name crossed off the electoral roll. They are then handed voting slips but there is no requirement to fill them out or submit them, or to submit a valid vote. This system ensures that no-one is forced to vote if they do not wish to, but also ensures that the barriers to participation are removed. It embodies the Australian ethos of ""a fair go for all"". Sadly I don't think the system used here in the USA is worthy of its citizens."	4845710	Wed Nov 09 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

Mike	5	0	Mandatory voting is the dream of the well financed campaign. Voters who don't care and aren't going to bother learning anything about the issues are going to be the ideal targets for campaign ads designed not to inform, but to simply build a meaningless yet favorable association between the voter and the candidate. Promoting voter turnout is only of benefit to society if those voters are educated voters.	4842752	Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

LEAFican	1	0	Mandatory voting would make matters worse. Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue. It is one that goes to core values of all Americans.	4842409	Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

rohit	4	0	I would be in favor of the following. At least one of the two chambers (presumably the Senate) should ONLY have voters who have graduated from college. Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish. Of course Democrats have their own banks of ignorant voters, the sin is shared by the parties.	4839122	Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

KURT WASSERMAN	3	0	Sad but true, some people think that abstaining from casting their ballots is a meaningful sign of disatisfaction with the political class, or with both or one of the parties, or with the set of candidates that have been selected to run for office. What is true of abstention is that it means giving up the one right we all have, that if it's exercised by all or a substantial percentage of our qualified voters will make all the difference in attaining comitments to goals that are more compatible with the wishes as well as the needs of the majority. Therefore, I think that compulsory voting legislation is worth a national debate.	4837239	Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

BG Graham	1	0	Wrong, America does not have serious voter turnout problems. Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote. That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win! And finally, this is one of the stupidest, most over-reaching, totalitarian ideas since Obamacare mandating that people who do not want to pay for insurance should be forced to get it anyway. American Democrats look worse and worse with every one of these obviously manipulative ploys for power they throw out there.	14464733	Fri Mar 20 00:00:00 CET 2015	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

Alph Williams	2	0	As an expat living in Australia I am fortunate enough to have dual citizenship. I have often wrestled with the idea of mandatory voting. I finally came to the realisation that it was the right thing. Some believe mandatory voting is an infringement on their rights. But voting is more than a right. It is a civic duty, like paying taxes. Voting is the least we can do to take part in the democratic process. Along with mandatory voting we should also insure that anyone can run for office without having to sell their soul to big money to finance a campaign.

Mr. Brennans position makes more sense. People who have at least some knowledge of the candidates and / or the issues at hand are much more likely to cast votes which result in decisions reflect the thinking of the electorate. Voters who don't think, don't know, and don't care, can't help and only further confuse thing.	4840901	Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Voting Be Mandatory?

Some of the messes I witnessed as both a Mental Health counselor and an Addictions counselor: A client going through a $26,000 dollar inheritance in one weekend. An untold number of families whose only paycheck was blown the same day its owner was paid. An infant left in a car in July for hours by his mother while she played video poker, oblivious to the passing of time. The infant died. Two enterprising young men crowing about the $7,000 jackpot they won after putting twice that much in the machine. (The crack addict, at least has something material in his hand, momentarily anyway, when he blows his wad.). The question isn't about individual liberty.

Brando	6	0	While I understand the desire to protect those addicted to gambling, the simple truth is that gambling addicts are already gambling online, without any oversight or regulation. The illegality of it isn't stopping that. Legalization would bring a huge underground industry into the open. Furthermore, the negative opinions make it sound like every computer in America will be wired into an online casino. School and workplace computers will certainly not be able to do that without detection by supervisors, and parents can keep their kids away by making sure they don't have access to credit cards. The simple fact is that millions of Americans enjoy gambling and do so responsibly. If we're going to keep it illegal because a small minority can't control themselves, then I guess we better get busy outlawing alcohol, tobacco, and fast food too.	2323452	Fri Jul 30 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Should Internet Gambling Be Legalized?

Dave McCombs	25	0	It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.	9306087	Mon Jun 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	false	false	Not to tip

Right now, tips put some of the power in the hands of the service person.

Sarah	9	0	It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage. (I think studies prove we'd be far better off putting an end to tipping altogether, but that's another story.)	9304522	Mon Jun 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	false	false	Not to tip

It has worked quite well -- I rather enjoy tipping generously for good service -- that sort of work, after all, is a livelihood for many and should be more widely regarded as a profession.

ACS	3	0	I will go to Sushi Yasuda now just because they have this policy. Tipping is an annoying and outdated American custom. Frankly, I'm surprised servers are so up in arms about it. Particularly in a recession state, having a predictable salary would be more of an ideal state, rather than relying on the generosity of its patrons. As restaurants continue to increase the price of food and drinks, tipping will indeed suffer. Either lower the cost of meals, and leave tipping in place - or - keep prices as is and offer salary. I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done. Not because you simply take my order and bring food. You have to exceed expectations / work for my money. Don't like the industry you are in or unsatisfied with the low wage, then you should do something about it and don't expect me and other patrons to reward you.	9309738	Mon Jun 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	true	false	Not to tip

black mantle	1	0	every once in awhile, there will be a newspaper article about restaurants and tipping. the people who never once worked in a restaurant scream for business owners to pay us a living wage. so in theory that would be adding let's say...18% to all the items on the menu to compensate for the waitstaff''s wages. so honestly.....you're going to be paying 18% more. either way. why would you not want to be in control of your 18%? you would all be screaming if you received horrible service from a waiter who had no incentive to do a proper job taking care of you, and no recourse as your tip could not reflect your disappointment. i know everyone's answer will be complaining to mgt. but you'll still be minus that 18%	9307323	Mon Jun 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	false	false	To tip
Kevin Brock	9	0	"Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, ""employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it."" I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's ""capitalist"" system, where ""the man"" controls how much servers get paid."	9307034	Mon Jun 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	false	false	To tip
Bob H	6	0	I think Steven A. Shaw may be on to something here. One of the things I have noticed while traveling and living abroad is how much better the service is in countries where there is no tipping (China) or where the tip is automatically added to the check (much of Europe). As counter-intuitive as it seems, I have come to the conclusion that tipping is actually a disincentive to good service but could never develop any notions as to why that might be.	9304062	Mon Jun 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	false	false	Not to tip

Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?"" The same reason all professionals do their job despite not getting tipped; fear of being fired, desire to impress the manager in order to get a raise/promotion. The idea that waiters are such lazy idiots that the only thing keeping them doing a good job is the immediate gratification of cash in their hand at the end of service is kind of insulting. They are people just like your accountants, IT staff, etc. They can see the benefit of working hard and at the end of the week getting a predictable paycheck and maybe even -gasp!- health insurance. Yes, eliminating tipping would only work if the structure of restaurant staff and compensation was rethought. Employers would have to be willing to treat their waitstaff like actual human beings, with appropriate wages, and their own incentive structure like present in all other businesses."	9360400	Mon Jul 01 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	false	false	Not to tip

This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers.	9312464	Tue Jun 25 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	false	false	Not to tip
Michael O'Neill	1	0	Actually Len is both right and wrong. Right in that tipping creates the environment we enjoy when we go out, but wrong in why it does. The people who seek and do well at jobs paid mainly via tips live in that world and it is a world they are competent and appreciated in. To so drastically change that world by eliminating the immediacy of the action and the reward would appeal to a completely different type of person. I know that I could never have been successful in that world. Because I never would have found pleasure in it. But I respect those that do and enjoy both the experience of being served well and the pleasure of tipping graciously.	9311766	Tue Jun 25 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	false	false	To tip

Surely newspaper readers are the best arbiters of how much he should be paid based on our perceived satisfaction/lack of distraction/momentary sense of generosity. Why on earth would he want to be paid an agreed-upon amount by his employer instead of gratefully receiving whatever tips or small pieces of bounty we choose to throw his way? And in all serious: does anyone actually tip based on the quality of service, unless it's been truly beyond wretched (i.e. a situation in which we would have complained to the manager anyway)? I can't imagine not tipping 18-20% -- because I owe it to the servers, who I know can't even make minimum wage without it. That's my *standard* tip. The only thing notable about it is that it's a pain to calculate, and it makes me feel uncomfortable with the waitstaff every time because it's an awkward and demeaning situation, no matter how used to it we get or how much we try to ignore it.	9304568	Mon Jun 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	To Tip or Not to Tip	Should restaurants do away with tipping?	/roomfordebate/2013/06/23/to-tip-or-not-to-tip	Not to tip	To tip	true	false	Not to tip

Every place you go up to a counter, place an order, pick it up yourself, clear your own table--has a tip jar. Should we have tip jars for librarians? Grocery checkers? Shoe sales people? The whole thing is insane. People should work for wages, and employers should pay them. If that means the product costs more, we have a choice about consuming/buying it. PS I had my days as a waitress. So has my daughter. I understand that if you're paid no wages, you depend on tips--and I tip in restaurants.

Greedy shop operators take their cut off the top. Drivers need to be paid for the use of their vehicles but often do not get enough from the owners to defray those costs. Often, too, the delivery people get compensated at the same paltry rates as inside wait staff - with the implicit inclusion of a certain gratuity amount to even meet the minimum wage.. An educated consumer will ask: ""Does the delivery charge include your gratuity and the costs you incurred using your vehicle to get here?""

I still contend that giving someone a tip when I'm done eating does not guarantee me good service. Many simply expect the tip. Some get bent if what you give isn't what they expected even if the tip reflected the service they provided. Business should pay a fair wage, disallow tips and charge accordingly.

The answer is because in Europe, restaurant staff are treated like professionals and they respond accordingly. They receive decent wages and benefits, are properly trained and take pride in doing a good job. American wait staff tend to be young people, filling time until something better comes along. Their obsequious desire to please doesn't make up for being overworked and improperly trained.

That the former Rocky Flats is now, after cursory cleanup, rechristened a wildlife refuge, is a bad joke; during the recent Colorado floods, the old settling ponds spilled over, but no press organization has made any more than a terse mention of that. Many of our Superfund sites were nuclear facilities--badly run, often by influence- peddling contractors; careless about safety; top-notch only at classifying and concealing corner-cutting, errors, and injuries. What has changed that anyone thinks we will do better now? Is there anything in the way government works now that would encourage anyone to think that a renewed nuclear building program would fare any better than the long-ago Washington State Public Power Authority, which never opened a single plant?	10526193	Fri Nov 15 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Nuclear Power the Answer?

James Robert Deal	2	0	Baby sitting deadly radioactive waste for 100,000 years makes nuclear power a bad bargain and using an accrual system of accounting renders power companies and the government actuarily bankrupt. Also, the supply of uranium is limited. We are mining lower and lower grade ore. Also, nuclear reactors belch out radioactive gasses, including tritium, on a daily basis. Nothing is said about this because there is no way to capture tritium.	10527961	Fri Nov 15 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Nuclear Power the Answer?

Pyramider	1	0	Nuclear energy can be a safe and clean source of power if we replace the current light-water and heavy-water reactor designs with thorium-cycle reactors. But that will only happen with a groundswell of political opposition to the standard designs and awareness of the differences between types of nuclear reactors. The light-water and heavy-water reactor designs have become entrenched in our utility and government institutions since they were chosen in the 1940's and 1950's. That choice was made not on the basis of efficiency or safety, but because these designs could be rapidly built and because they create large quantities of uranium and plutonium waste for use in making nuclear weapons. We hold on to these older designs out of sheer regulatory inertia, and we will continue to do so to our great environmental and proliferative detriment until voters demand that the NRC and its international counterparts create frameworks that encourage the development of commercial thorium-cycle power plants.	10527395	Fri Nov 15 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Nuclear Power the Answer?

Marcus Vitone	1	0	I totally agree with this premise. As a younger person I was against Nuclear power (I was in college during 3 mile island) but now it seems that nuclear should be in the mix. Fission technology is better, and will continue to get better if we actively promote its development. The prospect of fusion energy also needs to be explored. If it's good enough for the sun and the stars, it's good enough for me.	10524673	Fri Nov 15 00:00:00 CET 2013	Is Nuclear Power the Answer?

fast&furious	12	0	I was a teaching assistant while in grad school at the University of California nearly 30 years ago and was amazed how many foreign students were in my classes. Some of them had no idea - or desire - how to do the work & whined & confronted me when they got their less than stellar grades. Rich, entitled jerks. Two very wealthy spoiled guys from Saudi Arabia (who hated being taught by a woman) were openly contemptuous of me and one tried to get me fired because I gave him a C. (which was generous of me). I used to wonder why UC was filling so many spaces with these people when it seemed nearly every 18 year old in the state of California was trying to get admitted to UC. I imagine most of them were more deserving than the spoiled foreign students I met. One exception: the students from Iran. I probably taught several dozen of them. Really smart & hardworking. Good attitudes. Thought that was worth saying.	18177065	Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Public Universities Neglecting In-State Students?

Wcdessert Girl	1	0	This has been going on for some time now, and is one of the reasons I find Bernie Sanders promising free public college tuition so misleading. How is the federal government going force state governments, many of which are constantly on the verge of insolvency and outright bankruptcy in the some cases, to give free tuition to all students? They are rejecting in-state students just to get the higher tuition rate of out of state students to shore up budget gaps. The irony that higher out of state tuition was put in place to deter those potential students from taking too many spots away from residents.	18248730	Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Public Universities Neglecting In-State Students?

Margo	3	0	The costs of running a university have been increasing alarmingly. Having foreign and out of state students paying full tuition seems like a good response, but it becomes a chicken and egg situation: which caused the other? What has caused the administration outnumber or nearly outnumber teaching staff? I especially am unhappy with large increases in foreign students because they can use the state-side degree to help short-cut visa rules: foreign students are effectively paying tuition as a penalty or fee to get access visa ahead of less wealthy applicants. The admissions office can hold a lot of power over foreign students with little clear oversight.	18178558	Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Public Universities Neglecting In-State Students?

Ivan K. Mattson	4	0	California's in-state/out-of-state tuition policies are a boon for Utah. Some of the smartest students I've met at Utah State University found that out-of-state tuition at USU is tens of thousands of dollars less than in-state tuition in California. So they came here instead. Perhaps public universities in Utah and California are playing the same game, trying to attract out-of-state residents who will pay more tuition at the expense of admitting qualified in-state applicants. When two states play this game, the state with a lower cost of living wins. As California seeks to attract overseas and out-of-state talent, it should seriously consider where outside its borders it is driving its own in-state talent to go.	18178237	Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Public Universities Neglecting In-State Students?

Stu	10	0	So the solution is to throw yet more money at low income students, who's parents have likely not contributed to the tax base very much, keep bringing in foreign students who pay full price or more and for heavens sake keep paying the administrators millions. Who ends up getting the shaft? White middle class kids. Their parents are paying the rent for the state, they won't get any extra consideration for being a minority or being poor, and are going to have to shoulder more of the burden themselves. But they'll pay, because they're smart enough to know it's worth the sacrifice just as the schools are banking on.	18177805	Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Public Universities Neglecting In-State Students?

Danielle	29	0	My daughter was rejected by four UC schools, and yet, was accepted to NYU, Boston University, North Eastern, George Washington, and University of Maryland. She had a 3.9 GPA, multiple AP courses and 2200 on her SAT. It would have been nice to have the option to pay in-state college tuition, which is a fraction of the cost of sending her to a private out of state University. She is thriving at NYU and she is fortunate that I could afford to send her there. I have been taxes for decades as a resident of California and was denied access to one of the best University systems in the US.

I would never have believed how actively they recruited those students had it not been for a vacation several years ago in New York City. While perusing the Sunday Times over morning coffee, I saw a full page ad encouraging New Yorkers to consider Indiana University for their education. I'm sure other state schools do the same. I know there are funding issues as the state legislatures pull back their money, but it's sad to see out of staters so actively enticed solely because of their checkbooks paying that out of state tuition.	18177006	Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Public Universities Neglecting In-State Students?

ZAW	3	0	It seems to me that two things could happen, to make it easier for in-state students to attend public universities. . First, the universities could go from a two tiered; to a three tiered tuition model. Instead of in-state and out-of-state, it could be in-state, out-of-state and foreign. The foreign tuition could be almost as high as that of private universities, and it could allow public universities to benefit more from fewer foreign students. . The other thing they could do, is team up with Community Colleges to formalize what a lot of poorer students are already doing: which is to go to community college for two years and then transfer into a state school. They could pre-approve credit transfers; establish a separate approval process for students applying from the community colleges (to benefit poorer students), and even share lower level classes with the community colleges (allow community college students to take 100 level courses for example, for credit).	18176737	Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Public Universities Neglecting In-State Students?

Yes, getting international students is nice, promotes American values, brings money into the country, etc. etc., but let's ask a nasty question: if an applicant is coming from abroad and will pay full freight for whatever tuition bill the university hands him, what incentive does any school (state, private, whatever) have to create financially livable conditions for students and provide financial help to American kids to avoid a debt-filled future?

Timohuatl	18	0	The UC system was envisioned in the 1960's to admit 13% of California high school students. Today, in practice, approximately 9% are admitted. Some of the reduction in admittance rates results from the fact that a larger number of students from out of state are admitted in order to capture more revenue. Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year. The impact is serious--they attend lesser in-state schools, go to out-of-state public universities, or they attend private schools. The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy. The State of California ends up with a large number of students who are less educated, have higher debt rates, or leave the state permanently.	18177142	Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Are Public Universities Neglecting In-State Students?

Mr. Cotti gives at least passing notice to the former, but shows no awareness of the latter. How many good, permanent jobs with career ladders could be created by investing in, say, a medical complex, a nursing home, a high-tech construction firm, or a solar panel manufacturing plant?

To build casino's that simply transfer money from one person to a establishment is not creating anything. It is simply taking advantage of the frailties of the human condition to rob people. A caution however... everything has consequences, to build more Casinos is to invite more debt in the terms of social payments to the newly poor who have dumped their life savings into these black holes. The misery caused is also a real effect but our government seems to to be oblivious to misery caused.

tom mcmahon	13	0	it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas.

steve	11	0	Of course, immigrants take jobs away from younger less educated american citizens. Immigrants work for lower wages, and rely on government assistance to pay their bills. A majority of immigrant families rely on gov assistance. 75& go hispanic immigrant families receive gov assistance. the immigrant families can't make ends meet without gov assistance. Their wages are just their secondary source of income. The young american citizens can't live on the lower wages, so they stop applying for the low wage jobs. Heres an example, sheet rock work in home construction, which used to be done by black contractors and laborers, is now done exclusively by spanish speakers in my town. Those jobs paid well in the past, but real wages have dropped, lately	13771149	Thu Jan 08 00:00:00 CET 2015	Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?

Justacomment	4	0	I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed. Nobody is going to give them help or any other thing already granted by the tax payers, therefore, they not going to flood unemployment, food stamps, healthcare, financial aid, etc.	13765555	Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 CET 2015	Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?

Furthermore, even if you were to issue the more accurate statement that ""immigrants have seen a net gain in employment compared to 2007, while native-born Americans have seen a net loss,"" you would still be intentionally misleading your readers, and here's why: By omission, you are implying that the gains of immigrants and the losses of native-born Americans are directly intertwined. In some ways, perhaps they are. However, you are ignoring the fact that the economy shed 8.7 MILLION jobs in the ""Great Recession,"" having to do primarily with the recklessness of our financial services industry and almost nothing to do with immigrants. A struggling recovery may have favored immigrants in certain sectors, but that doesn't mean that they, as a group, are to blame for America's labor market woes.

I have worked in 5 different banks and this comment is not an exaggeration. In fact, in the fifteen years that I have been in this industry I have seen only a handful of recent American university graduates employed.

Koyote	3	0	The commenters claiming that low-wage immigrants drive down wage rates all have one thing in common: they cite no evidence. What Mr. Camarota and those commenters fail to mention is that, George Borjas' widely-criticized study notwithstanding, many studies indicate that low-wage immigration actually RAISES wage rates for native-born U.S. workers -- especially if we are considering real wage rates, which are enhanced by the lower costs we all pay for the services done by immigrants such as child care, construction, food service, etc. I know that conclusion seems counter-intuitive, but that is often the case in economics.	13762079	Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 CET 2015	Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?

So why is this group, which contrary to actual principles of research and study has already drawn its conclusions, invited to give comment on a perfectly legitimate question? I am a liberal but I've known people who can no longer fine regular employment in the construction industry because those jobs now go to immigrants who are paid lower wages and offered no benefits such as workman's comp. Many readers on the right and the left understand the many social benefits of immigration but have a reasonable worry of wages being driven further down in an economy in which the rewards seem to go almost exclusively to the top.

You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers. This kind of argument commits the fixed pie fallacy. It assumes that there's some fixed amount of low-skilled jobs that will exist anyway, and every job an immigrant takes is one a non-immigrant low-skilled worker loses.

Common Sense	14	0	The reason many Americas feel low-paid immigration takes jobs from our own citizens is the decline of moderate living-wage jobs. Now, citizens who would typically have worked in factories and other unskilled roles have no choice but to move downstream into food service and lawn care. Twenty years ago when we still had a healthy job market, Mexicans were blowing leaves off lawns, skimming pools, and bussing tables for sub-minimum wage pay.

Historian	1	0	Many commentators confuse the results of Reagan's union busting on American labor with the results of undocumented immigration. It was the former that often accelerated the latter, not least in meat and poultry processing. (Globalization also comes into play, but which party pushes hardest on free trade, and who fights minimum wage increases?) So where do the most vulnerable American workers, for whom Republican trolls have been shedding crocodile tears, come down on the issue? According to a March 2013 Pew poll, more than eight-in-ten non-Hispanic blacks (82%) favor letting illegal immigrants stay if they meet certain requirements; about half of blacks (52%) say illegal immigrants should be able to apply for citizenship. Just following the Democratic party line? Well, if the other party is spewing racial and ethnic hatred, do you have much choice? Asian-Americans were more polarized against the Republicans than even Hispanics in 2012.	13758977	Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 CET 2015	Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?

CityBumpkin	2	0	"""Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?"" seems to imply those jobs belong to native-born workers by right. That's an interesting perspective, particularly given how America advertises itself as a meritocracy, where the jobs go to the hardest working and most skilled. Mr. Camarota is re-treading the same arguments raised by 19th century Know-Nothings. America has not imploded from immigration since then. Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now? Perhaps the more significant cause of the decline in employment opportunities is because jobs are being shipped to countries like China or Sri Lanka? Or perhaps it's because there is a lack in upwards social mobility through failing public education and rising costs of higher education?"	13758409	Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 CET 2015	Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?

Daddio7	5	0	No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights.	13780885	Thu Jan 08 00:00:00 CET 2015	Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?

Yeti	1	0	There is a false perception that the highly qualified foreign workers are cheaper than the American ones. The workers on visa are required to have a salary at least as high as the American ones, and they also get pension and stock options. Moreover, they can only be hired if no American worker is willing to take that particular job that should be advertised in mass-media of large circulation. The process itself is expensive because if requires the services of a law firm. Additionally, if fired, the company should pay the plane ticket back home. During recession years, no foreign worker can be hired as long the company fires Americans. If caught hiring illegals, a company may get into big trouble. The laws are made against hiring foreign workers and most companies prefer American workers. If there are so many foreign workers in high tech companies is because so many Americans with college degrees are not good enough for those jobs.	13761254	Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 CET 2015	Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?

Tired of Hypocrisy	5	0	The English language can be very precise when the correct words are being used. After reading this work of David Dyssegaard Kallick I am confused over the repeated use of the word immigrant. Does he mean a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence of which the US government allows over one million per year or is he referring to those who have entered or remained in the US in violation of law? By the very unlawful nature of their entry or stay we can have no precise number of how many are already here. Unemployment in the US amongst its citizens and lawful immigrants, especially those working in the trades or service industries, is high, too high. An influx of uncounted numbers of unskilled foreign workers illegally here cannot help reduce that number.	13771563	Thu Jan 08 00:00:00 CET 2015	Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers?

AcuVox	3	0	Convenience is opposed to quality. We have been a downward spiral of quality of experience from live music. The artificialities of recording and broadcast media get in the way, and the rush to the bottom in recorded quality to eliminate dynamic range proves that being able to hear any music on demand has reduced it to background, serving only to cover up the increasing noise of the world and paint over the isolation of the Information Age. I find it ironic that our computers are now fast enough to handle High Def but the information content of recording has been decreasing and the bit rate of radio is now below standard streaming, even on Classical stations like WQXR. There is no substitute for being in a room with musicians and others who share the feeling, and the easier it is to get low quality music, the less we want music of any caliber.	13293903	Mon Nov 10 00:00:00 CET 2014	Is Streaming Good for Musicians?

Our sailors were captured prior to sanctions being lifted, and were not returned until the sanctions were almost lifted, and a 1.7 billion dollar jizya, Islamic tax, was paid for our hostages. Again. Thee was no ""speedy diplomacy,"" or really any kind of rapprochement. The Iranian regime, unlike the Arab Spring, has not moved an iota since 1979.

allentown	6	0	In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran.	17293787	Thu Jan 21 00:00:00 CET 2016	Does Iran Remain a Threat?

We live in a time where the individual's rights under the law are ignored with indifference by those who feel empowered by public office or the ability to influence those in public office. There is much corruption in government, these days, because it is so hard for citizens to be fully informed about what their governments are doing and why.

George Mendelson	5	0	"Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call ""corruption"" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a ""you wash my back and I'll wash yours"" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best.

Uziel Nogueira	4	0	Brazil has a long tradition with klepto politicians dating back to colonial times. The same experience is shared by neighboring Spanish speaking countries in Latin America. Impunity from prosecution, among other privileges, was the registered mark of Portuguese and Spanish colonial ruling elite The tradition was carried out by the political class after independence in the first half of 19th century. Corruption among Brazilian politicians comes from all social groups, led by the ones coming from traditional wealthy families. Paulo Salim Maluf, scion of a traditional wealthy family in Sao Paulo, is the most infamous politician in the country today. Maluf continues to hold public office despite his name posted in INTERPOL's international capture list. Popular imagination even created the verb malufar = to steal in honor of the decrepit paulista politician. Brazil case study shows corruption is widespread among politicians coming from wealthy and poor backgrounds alike. The problem is not money and social background. The problem with corruption in Brazil is a political-legal system that guarantees impunity and/or lenient sentences for public office holders. In other words, send Maluf et all to stiff jail term and the problem of corruption will be under control.	8686382	Thu Apr 04 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Are Rich Politicians Less Corruptible?

Certainly there are prejudices among certain Christians against gays, but none have them rise, for instance, to government imposing the death penalty for homosexual acts, as is the case in many Muslim countries.

The United States is primarily christian based civilization where gay marriage is accepted as legal and any number of laws have been enacted that protect gays. Laws written by the democratically elected members of the society. That is legislators who in the majority are elected by mostly Christians. In this free society a non-christian, an avowed Islamist takes his non-Christian, muslim beliefs to the extreme and it is the christians that are to blame? No doubt it can be pointed out that there are other countries that are even more liberal but most if not all of those countries also have a Christian basis.

I asked a relative why she was so judgemental of people she thought were sinning (gays, divorcees) even though only god is supposed to judge. She said she knows what the bible says and so she can judge. Complete hatred from (evangelical fundamentalist) christians toward gays is mainly what I know. I have no doubt several of my relatives were wondering why more gays weren't killed in Orlando as I've heard those comments before. They're not keen on non-christian's either.

The ancient Israelites inherited a law that homosexual acts (particularly outside of a straight marriage) were sinful, but the rest of the Bible is silent on gay and lesbian people in committed relationships, or possibly it even hints at approval in the story of David and Jonathan. Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value. If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity.

Theodore Bale	9	0	The Christian church of my childhood was hostile to gays, and when I became an adult I made a point of visiting many different Christian churches and asking directly if I was welcome as a homosexual. It didn't go very well. At some point, and if you respect yourself, you just get tired of having so much hostility directed at you. Instead, I learned to meditate, found some compassionate teachers, and formally became a Buddhist in 1998. The Buddhists have only ever showed me unconditional love.

It was savage. And it was not about just having your own beliefs- it was about identifying people on the basis of their biology and denying them housing or being able to fire someone. Dobson was off studying gay pornography in DC to prove what he was saving people from- it was a surreal circus and earned Focus a black eye for a very long time for its divisive and ugly attitude towards total strangers.

Tony Perkins, of Focus on the Family has said the United States is doomed if marriage equality ever becomes the law of the land. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robinson have said the most vile and hateful things about the LGBT Community for decades. Focus on the Family along with many other fundamentalist sects have long hidden their hatred under the mantra, ""Hate the sin, love the sinner."" They have enlisted every political strategy, collected hundreds of millions of dollars and enlisted the help of the rich and powerful to oppose every single advance in civil rights for the LGBT Community.

Unfortunately their disease can be contagious, but usually infects very few. Like leprosy. Sometimes it infects nations as in WW II. The fact is that those waving the bloody rainbows are martyrs of their own making, torturing themselves with hatred and poison. They are addicted to being twisted and gaining pleasure by hurting others. But they damage themselves more than others, feeding on their addiction. The are empty. Hollow. Hopeless. And alone.

But the trope of reversing the intolerance argument is absurd, and I wish the right would stop using it. It reduces to ""you are being intolerant of our intolerance!"" You cannot preach freedom, and the freedom to limit the freedom of others in the same breath. The Christian Right wishes to take away the freedom of gays to marry. This is not a private belief on their part, but an actual infringement of others' liberty. The right may counter, that I preach freedom, but wish to deprive people the right to legally own automatic weapons.

conesnail	2	0	So often organized religion is morally bankrupt, trailing the enlightenment of the secular. When it was slavery, all the major protestant denominations split at the Mason Dixon line, with half embracing the cause of slavery. After the civil war they all embraced Jim Crow segregation. They finally come around long after everyone with a real conscience has. History now repeats itself on the LGBT issue. Gays and lesbians finally decided they had had enough and courageously proclaimed their right to be who they were, and most of the rest of us, when confronted with this obvious moral imperative, have recognized this societal wrong for what it was, equivalent to racism. Whose left? conservative religions (Islam included). They claim the higher moral ground but are always the last to see their own sin. I have no doubt that in the next twenty years or so, when it will no longer be possible to claim any moral standing or viability, they will, finally, also come around, The last, trailing indicator of a moral evolution, like always.

The idea that Christians hate Gays is an example of those adding fuel to the fire. Most of my intelligent and gifted Gay friends agree with me that the Gays has created more of the problem than they are willing to accept or change. Gays want those of all religions and different persuasions of faith to feel, act, accept and welcome them when they in turn are not willing to act, accept and welcome those who do not agree with their life style. I believe a Gay person can be a good Catholic, as does the Pope. I believe a Gay can be a Christian, as do most of my friends in the faith, but I can ask a Gay to accept me as a sinner, imperfect and less than God wants me to be. I do not understand why a Gay has to deny that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is a sin.

To use an example liberals could get behind, it's similar to getting attacked by Al Queda terrorists from Afghanistan and then invading Iraq.	18868046	Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Christians Created a Harmful Atmosphere for Gays?

Jack Belicic	15	0	Those who ascribe to a mythology-based belief system are well-known through history for the demonizing and murder of everyone else not like them. Christians have 2000 years of experience in the killing of Jews and others, and LGBT folks are only a more recent target because they have been harder to recognize in years past. Organized religions are gigantic hypocrisy machines, pointing to ancient texts to explain how kind they are while running pogroms and burning heretics at the stake most of the time. Our society should step away from the taxpayer-funded support of those whose sacred texts read like comic books with fairies, supermen and flying horses.

onlein	4	0	Christian churches long ago strayed from the gospel message of love and mercy and focused on certain sexual acts. Pope Francis recently called the Catholic church on its obsession with abortion, same-sex marriage and birth control. Such obsessions are narrow and negative and tend to miss Christ's main message: to treat persons as persons, not use them as objects. IMHO this means we should be more concerned about one person using or abusing another than about what two consenting adults do to express their love for each other.	18865471	Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Christians Created a Harmful Atmosphere for Gays?

Obviously then, gay people have been around a long time, and apparently in every culture of humans on the planet. So, how is it that everyone doesn't see this as part of our human nature and just move on, like we do with people with blue eyes or brown hair. It is part of being human. And, if science is correct and we are actually MILLIONS of years old, gays may have been around for even longer. What is it about religions that tend to deny everything that they don;t like?

John Raymonda	8	0	"Quoting Dreher: ""We also believe that a society that loses that vision of sex and marriage courts disaster, and that the advance of L.G.B.T. rights means a corresponding loss of religious liberty -- hence our activism and our voting."" Religious liberty does not mean having the right to impose one's own religious beliefs on others, which is what denying LGBT people civil rights amounts to. For example, allowing same-sex marriage by those who want it presents no danger to those who oppose it and in no way infringes on your right not to engage in same-sex marriage, either individually or as a group. Being LGBT is not a disease, either physical or emotional and it is not contagious; it is a matter of one's biological make-up.

Web	13	0	"Christians appropriated the ""Old Testament"" aka the Jewish Scriptures as a prefiguration of the Greek ""New Testament."" So anything in the OT that they found handy, like God raining down destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, they tout incessantly. If Jesus said something contrary to that, like love thy neighbor, well, Jesus obviously meant ""except those you find reasons in the OT to hate on."" The basis of this illegitimate reading of the Jewish Scriptures is the Gospel attributed to John, the latest of the Gospels and the one most evangelicals love above all other books. John's Gospel says Jesus was In the Beginning, so He must have meant to condemn S & G just like his angry Father. For Dreher to say, as another commenter pointed out, that Christians have a right to base national policy and law on their own religious beliefs, is to assert the primacy of their personal beliefs over the beliefs and rights of others. That's the model of theocracy. Ironically, the same people who loudly protest against ""Sharia law"" would gladly impose ""Christian law"" on the nation.

Jeremy Mott	16	0	"Conservative Christians and evangelicals have not historically condemned divorce the way that the Bible does, but they certainly have condemned homosexuality, the way the Bible doesn't. I might respect conservative Christians for their consistency if they refused to do business with divorced people, the way they want to refuse gay patrons. But conservative Christians -- like Wheaton College -- employ divorced people, serve divorced people, and welcome divorced people into communion without blinking. Their constant refrain is that they ""hate the sin, but love the sinner."" Now I'm not proposing we abolish divorce, but I do wish evangelicals would just NOTICE that sin, if they're so determined to purify our society. But, in fact, they treat divorced people very differently from gay people, and they're not even aware of their hypocrisy. If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry. And then non-Christians might begin to realize that they can't use the Christian faith (or any other faith) to justify intolerance.

Her partner at the time (spouse in God's eyes) was prevented from being at her side in the hospital by Christians who condemned their relationship. Is this what Jesus would have done?

Carl Mahler	7	0	"It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of ""marriage"" has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah ""marry"" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife. Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one ""jot or tittle"" of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples."	18865357	Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Christians Created a Harmful Atmosphere for Gays?

Brad	6	0	The issue is not about all Christians. It is not about all conservative Christians. It is not about all orthodox Christians. It is about a segment of radical Christian fundamentalists that are vigorous in promoting a worldview that is based on a literal reading of some sentences in the Old Testament and are resistant to accepting cultural change and living in a secular society. I am understanding of their dismay and anger - after all, America has become a society where individualism, commercialism, materialism and transnational capitalism have triumphed over community, charity, spirituality and democratic socialism. They feel that they are under attack, just as men did when women received the vote and as whites did in the 1960s who had to live with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights act, which empowered minorities. Radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Muslim population, just a radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Christian population. Change is inevitable in America, and members of those radical fundamentalist groups are angry and afraid.

Hate is hate, and any hateful message, however polite and sugar coated it may be, still telegraphs prmission to commit acts of violence to those inclined to do so. It's hard for Dreher to see this as a white, heterosexual, cis-gendered male, who is afforded every possible privilege by society.

Michael Hogan	32	0	The day before the massacre I received a cartoon by e-mail from a conservative friend - yes, I lean liberal, but I have many good friends who are quite conservative - that very explicitly managed simultaneously to smear Muslims - ALL Muslims - as being anti-gay while at the same time smearing liberals - ALL liberals - as treating Christian conservatives differently from Muslims when it comes to being anti-gay and implying that we do so out of some misguided sense of political correctness. You, sir, are deeply in denial about both the depth of conservative animus toward people with different values to yours, and about the way in which the conservative community uses that animus to demonize and dehumanize those who disagree with you. Either than, or you just don't care and are willing to say anything to justify continuing down the same path you've been pursuing, which while it is not entirely to blame for what happened in Orlando (and elsewhere) UNQUESTIONABLY contributed to it. You're on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of the moral divide on this - indeed, you're on the wrong side of Christ's teachings, if you really care.	18862964	Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Christians Created a Harmful Atmosphere for Gays?

Beth G	21	0	Mr. Dreher, as someone who grew up with only a passing familiarity with the Bible, I would like to understand the belief of religious folk that the Bible prescribes marriage as between one man and one woman. It seems quite a number of men in the Bible have many wives. In fact it seems polygamy is the norm. Can you please reconcile that contradiction? Also, how does giving equal rights to gay folks impact your religious liberty? That one is head scratcher to me and many others, we simply do not understand the connection. Lastly, how do you reconcile the foundational separation of church and state in this country with Christian political activism against gays? Do you want to create a Christian version of Sharia law here?

Paul G	44	0	"The author write, ""In the past, many Christians treated gays cruelly."" The problem is that quite a few Christians continue to do so in the present. The typical response is a shake of the head, a trie disapproval of their actions, and some meaningless comment to the effect that 'those poeple' don't represent the attitude of the majority. More is required. If an organization... or a religion.. is to claim the moral high ground, it must police its members, kicking them out if necessary. This can be a bit of trick for some Christians, stuck as they are with a holy book that approves of the behaviors they now claim to condemn, combined with the attitude that anyone can be 'saved'... provided that they follow some of the instructions in that book."	18862412	Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Have Christians Created a Harmful Atmosphere for Gays?

B Dawson, the Furry Herbalist	6	0	A succinct and to the point article. Reading some of the other opinions in this Room for Debate series shows just how resistant many are to supporting agriculture in the US. So many see no problem with processed foods with an - dare I use the word? - un-natural shelf life. I have watched over the decades as farmers' children wanted other careers. The farms eventually get sold to a developer and the people who buy into the 4-houses-per-acre plat soon start to complain about living next door to a working farm. The zoning changes that result from the complaints further suppress any hope of continuing a family farm. Americans are so unaware of what it takes to bring food to the store modern day, being more concerned about how much food costs or how convenient it is to prepare than the consequences of how it's grown, slaughtered or preserved.	13302258	Tue Nov 11 00:00:00 CET 2014	What Makes 'Natural' Natural?

Consumer protest works, but not when it is a solo effort. A bit much self-promotion here. 2. This debate is about one word, ""natural."" Language is too complex for the debate to be about one word. The issue is can claiming in the name that something is not present. It defies logic to state in a product name that lemon is in the product when in fact there is no lemon at all. That is simply misleading (bold face lying). ""Lemon"" in common nomenclature is something that comes from the lemon plant, not it's laboratory produced analog. Isn't truth in advertising the issue? 3. My food slogan is ""I'm very careful about what I put in my mouth.""

Former Victim of Sexual Abuse	21	0	I learned cursive in grade school back in the 80's and I haven't stopped using it since. It's a skill I am grateful I have. As kids, we took pride in our handwriting...today...I don't think kids know what a pen is. That's sad. I look at some handwriting from pretty high level professionals and it's atrocious. People don't even write whole words anymore. To me, this speaks to standards, which I believe were effectively lowered forever when spellcheck was invented. Soon the question will be asked...do children need to write at all...can't they just text the answers to their teachers?

I'm more appalled to read here that SPELLING is not required in the Common Core standards! Are you serious? I'd noticed a lack of focus on spelling as my kids have gone through school, but I didn't realize that we nationally did not consider it an important skill. Spell-check isn't a good substitute, people! It is frequently wrong. And my kids seem to believe that if spell-check says something might be wrong, that it IS wrong - causing them to make more errors than they would have. (Besides, if spell-check is the reason spelling isn't crucial anymore, then why didn't we skip teaching spelling once dictionaries were invented?)

Eric Herot	5	0	I'm amazed that so many of the comments on this piece seem to be comparing the usefulness of cursive to other forms of handwriting. I think this ignores the larger point, which is that hand-written print is largely dead outside of school. Any significant time spent learning or practicing handwriting instead of, say, critical thinking skills or grammatical structure is wasted in my opinion. Today's students are not going to write on the job. They're going to use a computer. And if anything we should be spending *more* time teaching them to use said computer instead of learning how to write things long hand--a skill which they will never use.	8891582	Wed May 01 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is Cursive Dead?

JaaaaayCeeeee	7	0	I once got a summer job near the House of Seven Gables, in Salem, in the hall of records, deciphering and keying in old deed books, from the 1700's. At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life. Those who have gone through these steps learn better how to summarize, as they take notes, even if eventually on only keyboards. A side benefit is that they can appreciate cursive, and the history it sometimes cradles.	8889573	Wed May 01 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is Cursive Dead?

Writing in print is impossible. It is so slow as to be like using a early (not even late) generation dial-up modem. And for me at least, writing does stimulate thinking in a way that nothing else does. I took all my college and law school exams in writing, even though we were allowed to type them. For me at least, not being able to write really really fast would greatly lessen my capabilities.

AC	1	0	No practical government ratings system could accurately measure learning while controlling for complex multiple aspects of rigor in all fields and for the differing preparation and potential of students at each institution and in each program. Among the many unintended consequences would be an increased need for mid-level administrators, decreased academic rigor, and weakening of policies that lead to some student failures -- rigor and policies (like required attendance, participation, and timely work) on which the value of degrees to employers and graduate institutions is based. My specialized private non-profit college has many non-traditional students who come for artistic and technical training and don't plan to complete a degree (often because they already have one in a different field); they leave when they've learned the rare, highly marketable skills they came for and find work, but they depress the graduation rate despite their satisfaction and success. The value and effectiveness of colleges is not so easy to measure, and the unintended consequences of measuring them crudely could be devastating to many excellent, effective, but atypical institutions, or programs within institutions.	11891553	Wed May 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the Government Grade Colleges?

Stafford Smith	6	0	It's good to see that the educational bureaucracy is falling into line behind this proposal. Laggards and doubters can surely be brought around by the prospect of generous federal grants to develop ratings systems models and protocols and test them on various institutional cohorts. The primary goal of education is, of course, is to produce uniform and interchangeable cogs for the economic machine, so that it will hum smoothly and predictably. A college ratings system will extend the infallible testing paradigm into whole new realms, taking our country to heretofore unimaginable new heights of sameness. The wise sages at the Business Roundtable and the Gates Foundation will love it. The great successes of the primary and secondary school testing models can now be applied to the entire educational system. Victory is almost in our grasp.	11892627	Wed May 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the Government Grade Colleges?

Liza	1	0	We need objective information about different Universities/Colleges but I think the type of information the Obama Admin wants wont be that useful. Most reputable charities provide information on the percentage of their funds are spent on administration and what percentage is spent on charitable activities. I think the most useful rating system that could be enacted is one that provides information on what percentage of tuition is spent on administrative salaries and non-instructional costs and what is spent on instruction. Instruction would include: libraries, technology in classrooms, faculty salaries, advising etc. Administrative salaries, fancy food courts, fancy health clubs and the endless numbers of Vice Presidents would be excluded from Instructional Costs. I am a faculty member at public university and I have not had a raise in almost 8 years. I can tell you that most of the tuition money is not going to people like me who work with students every single day. If Universities had to state clearly how much money is spent on non-instructinal activities perhaps things would start to change for the better.	11900472	Thu May 29 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the Government Grade Colleges?

Shana	2	0	The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing.	11900079	Thu May 29 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the Government Grade Colleges?

Many reviews are conducted in many areas by the feds but the politics, ability of staff whom review, understanding of what they are reviewing, implementation, initial results and then white washing the results leaves much to be desired.

Beware of the man who promises more than anyone can possibly deliver: ""Ideally, the rating and performance-based funding system would drive states, institutions and students toward the transformative change needed to tame student loan debt and jump-start social mobility."" Yeah, right. As if. We have an increasingly unequal society. Parents and students are afraid they won't learn what they need for success. Educational ranking, in that environment of fear, pushes schools into offering quicker graduation, streamlined curricula, and narrower and more uniform education, in order to prove they can hit their numbers. Student learning cannot easily be measured. So it will be neglected in favor of what can be measured. What this guy is advocating is harmful to students and harmful to education.

Tom Williford	5	0	A ratings system that leads to accountability seems to be the Obama administration's backdoor attempt to control the for-profits, who are, by and large, giving out junk degrees while raking in the federal loans. The easiest solution is to refuse to lend Federal money to students who attend for-profits; however, the for-profit lobby is too powerful in Congress to make this happen. So Obama is proposing a compromise--rate all of the universities and decide on federal loans from there. Like the health insurance compromise that resulted in Obamacare, setting up a ratings system is a messy solution, but better than doing nothing. The growing student debt problem may very well be our next financial crisis, and if a ratings system can prevent it, so be it.	11894913	Wed May 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the Government Grade Colleges?

Eric Key	1	0	What is needed is information, not digested information or information processed through someone's personal view of what is going on. Why not give us the data and let us decide? As an example, Tell us graduate rates vs ACT scores, the whole table, not the correlation coefficient. Loan debt versus time to graduation, high school GPA versus timely progression to degree. Athletic budget versus library budget. Full time faculty vs other instructors. I can think of many things which would help families decide if the school was legitimate and a good fit for their child than just some grade or two. As a university mathematics professor I am too well aware of how little information a grade conveys about a student's progress.

Mark Pine	3	0	Ranking, per se, is unnecessary, and it would force colleges and induce students to focus on a single score rather than education. But more information is needed about the value of the educational experience each college provides. The government would do well to develop indexes of various kinds of student achievement. Perhaps five or ten indexes, uniformly scaled 0 to 10 or 0 100, would each measure an important aspect of a college's student body's performance. It would not be necessary to rank-order colleges, because each of the 5 or 10 scores would use the same standardized scale.	11893475	Wed May 28 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Should the Government Grade Colleges?

Those who chose the three year program are ready for work right after graduating from CEGEP.

Too many of the students vote for what they think sounds cool. They don't think about or care about the consequences. It's easy to vote for a new tax or bond when you aren't the ones paying for it. It's just so cool to vote for a city or county politician who advocates for free everything -- more subsidized housing and shelters for the homeless and drug treatment centers and...on and on -- when every summer you return to your mom and dad's comfortable home in a leafy suburb far, far away. Voting should be tied to one's legal address, period. And for dependent children, that legal address should be where mom and/or dad, or legal guardians, live.	17972248	Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CET 2016	Do College Students' Votes Really Matter in an Election?

frustrated with smartphones	2	0	I am a 20-year-old female college student who does not own a smart phone and does not wish to own one. I feel as though I am one of the few left of my age (and in general) who have not been sucked into the smartphone (mostly iphone) world. It can be very frustrating for me when my friends are constantly glued to their devices. I often find myself in social situations where everyone in the room are on their phones and I am left sitting, waiting for someone to come back into the real world in order to have a conversation or to decide on something to do other than stare at a screen. In this sense I agree that smartphones/facebook can be potentially damaging to relationships or at least to proper social conduct.	8062872	Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CET 2013	Has Facebook Ruined Love?

Something Chaplin would satirize with brilliance. its a way of blocking out the real world. the screen becomes 'real' and 'life'. I wonder sometimes what happens to the mind when it is focussed on a li'l screen much of the day. what happens to the mind when all communication is broken into 140 word screeds. what happens when we become unaccustomed to each other.

Michael	4	0	I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology.	7968605	Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CET 2013	Has Facebook Ruined Love?

No - the 3 females were busy checking each other's photos and text messages on all 3 of their iPhones, giggling, sharing, not interacting with the guys at all.

Frank C	2	0	I suppose that it is unnecessary. Perhaps, one should also acknowledge one's luck when the ball barely touches the line. However, anything that prevents, limits, boorish behavior in sports should be supported. After all, in soccer when a player gets hurt, the opposite players stop the play by kicking the ball out of bonds as not to enjoy an advantage. And this is from players that routinely will step on the other's foot or slide with such force that if a direct contact were made, it would break an opponent's leg.	12649273	Tue Aug 26 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Is Tennis Strung Too Tight?

The concentration and intensity required to play tournament tennis just can't tolerate it. As for Mr. Dizikes' comments, I couldn't agree more. The game is immensely improved by the absence of the antics of the likes of Nastase, Connors, and McEnroe. All credit to the gentlemen of the game. Fashion?

j	5	0	The real gateway drugs are prescribed by doctors. Those are dangerous and we are seeing the fallout from increased heroin addiction and overdose death. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be used too frequently, or used at times when we need to be sober, like during work or before operating a vehicle. And children most definitely should not partake. Alcohol can be just as dangerous as any drug. Even though the majority of citizens do not abuse alcohol, there are some among us who simply cannot drink responsibly. There will be some who cannot use marijuana responsibly either, but I don't think policy should be written for those who abuse a substance. That is not effective policy.	18336292	Tue Apr 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?

etkindh1	12	0	Perhaps we should look to the legal drugs that proceed marijuana use, like tobacco, nicotine and alcohol? And perhaps we should looks to where the current new opiate addicts get their starts with opiates? That would be your friendly local physician and pain clinics. The role of pot as a gateway drug has little statistical evidence, and the criminalization of marijuana has had terrible social effects on youth and minority populations. Perhaps we should research the social effects of marijuana being illegal and that sentencing guidelines are based on marijuana.

Dale Adcock	2	0	The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups.	18361233	Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?

Stephen J Johnston	11	0	At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal. There is no chance of lethal seizures on cold turkey cessation of use. MJ is not addictive, and it has never killed anyone by overdose. Opiates kill about 16-20 K people a year. Deaths from over the counter NSAIDS like aspirin are about as high, but again no one has ever bled out from MJ. Why would a reasonable person even make the comparison between MJ and opiates, when there is no equivalency? Alcohol is the most addictive and lethal intoxicant of all narcotics or benzos or even crack. When a football player is suspended for MJ detected in his body, I know I'm in a world full of crazy people. There is no rime or reason!	18341957	Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?

Daphne	1	0	If you'd like to call marijuana a gateway drug, then you'll have to include tobacco and alcohol, too.... also indicators. Why don't lets focus our attention on solving real problems. This country doesn't have a marijuana problem, and just because there's a correlation between people addicted to harder drugs like alcohol and painkillers who also smoke pot doesn't make it pot cause. If we have time and energy and resources, let's work on the drugs we know are dangerous and lets work on general education about addiction. Diverting our attention and energies from epidemic-level heroin use, for example, or from teaching about addiction generally to instead focus on marijuana specifically is worse than pointless, it will cost lives.	18339215	Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?

Jude Richvale	5	0	Cannabis was used in the middle east during the time of the Hebrew prophets. A Phoenician shipwreck dating from 1400 BC was found in the eastern Mediterranean with a cargo of Olive Oil and cannabis Amphoras. The Phoenicians traded with their close neighbors the Hebrews as it says in the bible - King Hiram Of Tyre traded with King Solomon for Cedars for the temple in Jerusalem. If the Phoenicians had it the Hebrews had it. It is not far fetched to assume that some of the prophets may have used cannabis to gain their insights and to help them 'connect' with God. Following that logic if you are good Christian You should consume cannabis and thus become closer to God.	18336376	Tue Apr 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?

Ian MacFarlane	13	0	I have smoked Martijuana all of my adult life and never had the desire to try another drug. I have a drink now and then, but do not smoke cigarettes. None of the people I know, not one of them, who smoke joint have any inclination toward using harder drugs. I've never tried pot brownies but perhaps I'd like them better than smoking which cannot be good for my lungs. My sense is people who use hard drugs are predisposed to their use and not pushed along by toking on a pipe of mary jane.

mj	5	0	Mr. DuPont focuses on the wrong gateway. Accessing marijuana through the black market provides a gateway to other illegal drugs through that same market. Washington state has legal marijuana stores, but, just like the stores here that sell alcohol, you will not find heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine next to it on the shelf. Also, marijuana use was pervasive in Washington state well before it was legalized and arrest, incarceration and criminal records destroyed the lives and futures of far more people, especially young black and hispanic men, than smoking a bit of weed. The reason that marijuana was legalized is because it was simply impossible and impractical to continue ineffective and expensive prohibition. It is a practical solution aimed at harm reduction and closing the gateway to other illegal drugs.	18336918	Tue Apr 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?

Short answer to a complex question: Randolph Hearst owned timber he wanted to sell for newspaper pulp, his main competitor? Hemp, or marijuana, so he funded and campaign for its end as a legal product in the US. We see how the drug war has ended. Your reasoning could be applied to breast milk, most people had some, and some of them became addicts. In my view addiction is simply in a person's chemistry and some are susceptible, most people are not.

Steve	8	0	The increase in heroin use has nothing to do with marijuana. It is irresponsible to even suggest that. The increase in use was caused by the prescription drug oxycodone. If took the dirty drug heroin and made it into a clean pill. The perfect storm for a young population already in love with pills. Oxycodone on the black market was going for 20 to 60 dollars depending on strength. This lead the cash strapped youth to seek out methods such as smoking it to make it go further. Eventually they figure out smoking oxycodone and smoking heroin are identical and heroin is a lot cheaper. From there they may go on to shooting it up assuming they survive the smoking stage. I guess the fact that the MDs and pharmaceutical industry is to blame might be hard for another doctor to accept so just blame marijuana it always worked in the past.	18332086	Tue Apr 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?

Ben	59	0	The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny. This man has an M.D. and should know better than spreading this disinformation.	18330854	Tue Apr 26 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Marijuana a Gateway Drug?

tf	2	0	It's not like people are driving up to a gas station and standing around waiting for the car to charge. They will charge while parked (say when they are at work and won't drive again until the end of the day) or overnight if they have a charging station at their house or on the street outside their house. So I think the impatience argument is wrong because you are comparing it to current refueling methods. Once the infrastructure is there, this shouldn't be an issue. I agree the government should be investing in R&D of new technology, as well as ensure the electric generators of the future are using cleaner technology. Nuclear is costly, but is well suited for electric cars, since the demand would theoretically increase in off peak hours.	2653803	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

Mike Smitka	5	0	Agreed! -- the subsidies are egregious, and even on the R&D side the technologies involved are specific to the auto industry rather than general-purpose. If we want quick gains, go for diesel. Even that faces issues in the US: refinery capacity, a tax system that paradoxically leaves gasoline cheaper. Diesel engines are more expensive than gasoline engines, but it wouldn't take much of a subsidy to encourage users to switch -- just look at Europe, where in some countries diesel is the norm and gasoline the exception.	2652168	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

Evitzee	1	0	I suspect the real world performance of these batteries will be less than advertised. How will the Leaf do on a 95 degree summer afternoon in Houston with the a/c going full tilt and you are stuck in a freeway traffic jam for 90 minutes which frequently happens in all large cities? How will the Leaf do on -35 degree winter morning in Minneapolis and your commute is 25 miles each way and your place of work has only outdoor parking where the battery will remain well below zero and there is no recharging facility? Battery technology for the most part is stuck and until a breakthrough occurs in this area EV cars are a tiny niche.	2657258	Mon Oct 11 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

Betsy	2	0	While clearly the Volt is not perfect, I recall a lot of these same issues being brought up when the first hybrids were announced. Too expensive, not worth it, only die-hard environmentalists will buy them and lose money, etc. Yet today look at all the hybrids on the road. And the cost has come down. Is the Volt the answer to our car problems? Of course not. But maybe by starting to realize that gasoline isn't the only way to power a car, it'll lead to hydrogen-powered cars or fuel cells or who knows maybe a technology that doesn't even exist yet. More options are always better!	2655810	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

I guess it does since the last statement is rather limited, ""Thus, the electric car is not a cost effective answer to all our problems and would not exist without government tax subsidies."" It is not cost effective now. Our crazy-low gas prices are the result of decades of subsidies, not to mention a few wars and environmental costs. Was the light bulb cost effective the first month out? How about the personal computer? Remember the early ones with 250MB hard drives and those gigantic floppies?

aj	6	0	Mr. van Doren utterly disregards the ancillary improvements that will come when electric vehicles become a huge market, and automobile improvements begin to come from the realm of electronics and materials. He assumes, in effect, that the automobile industry will carry over its techological stagnation into a new propulsive means. But this is not true. In the first years of hybrids, many hackers have already gotten Priuses to run as plugins, increased their range, etc. I expect that battery technology will improve, incrementally, at a faster rate than any improvements in gasoline engines, and this disregards breakthroughs. The fact that there is significant commercial interest in electric vehicles at a point where they are marginally competitive is a vigorous and optimistic corner of a struggling economy.	2653827	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

leptoquark	10	0	Even if an ev gets the equivalent of 38 mpg, the electricity is sourced domestically, rather than from overseas, or Canadian tar sands, both of which has huge collateral costs. And, as electric generation migrates to sustainable baseload, ie geothermal, or large-area wind and solar with large scale storage, the CO2 emissions drop. No one will have to pay $33,000 for a Leaf, either, due to the tax incentives, which are a very wise and efficient use of tax dollars.	2652166	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

I would much prefer a car powered with natural gas. Drove a natual gas car all around Argentina. It had power, got me to where I needed to go, the natural gas was much cheaper than gas. Electric cars in the USA will be 65% powered by coal. What sense does that make? The wind and solar argument is only rational if we are willing to be irrational and spend hundreds of billions in government grants (yes outright grants) to make the industry viable. So I guess if you live in a place like NY City and drive very little such a car makes might make sense. Then I guess you just have to agree with coal powered elecrtric plants!

Some misconceptions are that batteries don't last that long (they do and are easily recyclable), biodiesel is a viable fuel source of trans fuel for the planet (will not hardly make a dent in demand), fuel cells technology is possible soon (long way off), environmentalists are responsible for keeping diesel cars out of the USA (VW is selling them and the EPA is responsible for clean air.) Electric costs will go up. (A larger percentage of charging will be in off-peak hours making power companies more efficient since they have to power up and down every night and incentives to build more efficient and alternative generation.) Or for no other reason, it's just plain stupid to make an electric car. (Don't buy one then.)	2656425	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

Bill	5	0	I drove the Leaf last week. It's a super little car that will be launch electric travel for the masses. For those who claim it will run up electric prices by burning more oil, they just don't realize that coal burning electric plants never shut down. One can't save electricity. You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense. Secondly, if you have solar in your home, you're already providing the grid with additional clean power. I hope that green technology will go hand-in-hand with the Leaf and other electric vehicles. And lastly, the average person drives less than one hundred miles a day. This giant fear of getting stuck is just that -- fear. It's amazing how fear stops progress. Be bold people.

They ARE available in the U.S. But the reason that the electric car is not likely to go anywhere in the next decade or two in this country will be the same reason that Americans do not have 50% of their cars using clean diesel. The SMART car has been in Canada for sometime, but in Canada it runs on a 3 cylinder diesel and gets over twice the mileage I get. But why isn't the diesel version of the Smart car in the U.S.? The clean diesel Smart cars of Canada and my VW Jetta both meet California emission standards. When the U.S. government can explain to the American public why we are so far behind Europe technologically, then perhaps we will move to fuel efficient vehicles. Electric cars in the U.S.A. will have the same fate as 8 track tapes and Sony Beta. Go figure..	2655502	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

curt	6	0	I'm getting a Leaf. 100 miles is plenty of range and I have no range anxiety concerns. Since I keep a car on average 20 years the Leaf will easily pay for itself (even with a battery pack replacement) over the years. The Leaf goes 38 miles on $1, a Prius only does 18 miles. The Leaf takes 1/3 the energy of an ICE to go the same mile. Being an engineer I like that efficiency. When I did a test drive, the solid ride and silence of the car was beyond anything I have experienced with a gas car. Toyota step aside, Nissan just leaped frogged you, and GM your VOLT will be a maintenance nightmare with its complexity.	2654977	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

Phil NH	3	0	I have two serious issues with plug-in cars, local and national. Locally, NH has the highest electric rates in the country (thanks, Seabrook). Nationally, plugging in is a huge waste of energy. To get a gallon of gas worth of electricity out of a wall socket, we need to put at least three gallons into the generator. Every time energy changes state, there is a loss: fuel to heat, heat to steam, steam to mechanical energy, mechanical to electrical, and in the car, electrical to battery, battery to mechanical, mechanical to tires, tires to motion. Add that to transmission losses, and you end up with a lot of waste instead of savings. Plug-in cars will add to the problem, not solve it.	2654246	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

Leo Frank, India	6	0	Well beyond doubt, the Electric Car technology is an environment friendly technology and a welcome one. But when it comes to business, it is not only the future savings, but also the affordability factor that needs to be kept in mind. As usual, only a select few will go for it initially. Later the masses will follow the suit, as and when the products get more and more affordable.	2653111	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

Mike Williams	2	0	I like the concept but I have yet to see a reasonable explanation for the added cost of an electric automotive drive train or the multi thousand dollar cost of battery replacement.. Deduct the piston engine, transmission, catalytic converter, liquid fuel system and more from the manufacturing cost. -- Add a 25Hp electric motor, battery charge/engine controller and battery pack to the same body shell. Labor content is about the same as all these components are mostly machine made. Compare with the Golf Cart / ATV industry -- whether gas or electric, the pricing is very similar.... but electric rules.	2653041	Fri Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

Wes Fowler	1	0	I agree with Mr. DeLorenzo, range anxiety is a huge issue with EV's. The current technology does not provide an affordable energy storage system. I am aware that Tesla has an EV capable of 300 miles per charge but the current model starts at $101,500, however they have another model scheduled to debut in 2012 for $49,000 (including a $7,500 tax credit). Which is out of the price range of the majority of the country. I believe EV's are a great alternative to ICE for some people, especially people who live in urban areas. I just cant see them ever being more than a niche market, until an affordable car comes around with a range similar to comparable ICE vehicles. With an infrastructure that will be able to support them, including charging stations and an improved electrical grid	2676507	Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Will Electric Cars Finally Succeed?

George	4	0	"Gandhi said (more or accurately) ""I am willing to die for India's independence, but there is no cause I would kill for.""

Gary Miller	14	0	"America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why ""they"" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the ""Arab Spring"" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that ""you reap what you sow"". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens.

4c	5	0	Drones are a weapon of the weak willed. Relying on them gives those unfamiliar with successful counter-insurgency tactics and strategies a sense of security when in fact the opposite is happening. If you do not 'drain the swamp' or wipe out the entire support systems that enable the insurgent/terrorist to survive, they multiply like vermin. Therefore we see the spread of the scourge throughout Africa and the Middle East. Also, the mood of these countries, especially Egypt, is increasingly anti-American. Had we wiped out the terrorists with our ground troops in and around Afghanistan (including the uncontrolled areas in Pakistan), with the correct number of troops needed, we would not be facing this problem today of increasing terrorism in Afghanistan and our troops under attack from the very Afghan military and police. Our policy is corrupt, ineffective and weak -- and it is the policy of the present Administration -- dragging our nation ever more into an abyss.	7228797	Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Do Drone Attacks Do More Harm Than Good?

Ken Belcher	14	0	Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague.	7228428	Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CEST 2012	Do Drone Attacks Do More Harm Than Good?

andre	3	0	In the early 80's and well into the 1990's, I frequently traveled from Paris to New York and back. French friends often supplied me with a list of specific American items 'they absolutely needed' and friends in the U.S. would do the same - asking for their favorite French things...Now, with the internet and globalization in full swing, this practice has completely stopped. Today, most of us *living almost anywhere* can simply order most anything 'foreign' on the web...and, more than likely, can actually find that very same item in a store close to where we live... The streets of Paris and New York are looking very much the same today (very boring)...and we're definitely inching closer to the dreaded one world concept.

But I've noticed that all the young couchsurfers who visit me (from all over the world) that their clothing all reflects the same trends we see in NYC as well. It's sort of like how many countries are slowly but surely losing their cultural distinctions as well, as people from other countries move in, store chains take up residence, McDonalds, etc. (NYC of course would be the sole exception to this, as that's what NYC is supposed to be all about...one huge melting pot.) But when I go to Paris for e.g., I want to see French people. I want to hear French being spoken. When I go to Rome, I don't want to eat Chinese food. If I go to some small village in Ghana, I don't want to see men walking around in Abercrombie or Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. I want to see people in their traditional clothing. But I guess there's no going back in this respect.	4389032	Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Has Globalization Ruined Street Style?

Biggs	9	0	Employees should be free to move or sell their talents to the highest bidder. A time restricted none compete that's enforced through compensation by the former employer who wishes to restrict the employee seems like reasonable protection for both sides. The employee can't work for a year or two in their most lucrative field but the employer who wishes to restrict them pays them a portion of their lost wages for the period of enforcement. A free market for goods and services includes labor. A none compete does more than protect intellectual property it suppresses wages and creates a sense that the employee is property of the employer if they wish to stay in the field were they have the most experience and potential value.	12004909	Wed Jun 11 00:00:00 CEST 2014	When Companies Close Doors to the Future	Should businesses be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals, agreeing to not to work for competitors?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/10/should-companies-be-allowed-to-make-workers-sign-noncompete-agreements	Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	false	false	Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals

Deus02	6	0	How ironic in which for decades now companies have been moving their manufacturing to low wage off shore locations to boost their profits yet they feel it necessary to attempt to legally inhibit an employee from moving on to a a better opportunity with another organization? Quite laughable when you think China, in particular, has paid little attention to patent rights and intellectual property, let alone their ongoing attempted hacking of American corporate secrets, yet, these companies remain there. If a company insisted on me signing such a questionable agreement, it is time to look elsewhere. The hypocrisy here is beyond the pale.	12004552	Wed Jun 11 00:00:00 CEST 2014	When Companies Close Doors to the Future	Should businesses be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals, agreeing to not to work for competitors?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/10/should-companies-be-allowed-to-make-workers-sign-noncompete-agreements	Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	false	false	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals
frw	12	0	It is absolutely venal and unsupportable for companies to think they have the right to suppress employees' future career options. Don't want sales employees to 'poach' clients? Keep the employees happy through good treatment and keep clients happy through relationships that go beyond the single sales person. I'd be willing to bet that every manager now trying to institute non-competes got to their current position by competing effectively up the ladder. Isn't honest competition the American way? Why should labor markets be allowed to dodge what all other markets are required to promote- competition? Just do your corporate job right, that's how you earn corporate success, not by limiting the career paths of employees after they leave you. The only legitimate use of these limitations would be in the area of trade secrets.	12002102	Wed Jun 11 00:00:00 CEST 2014	When Companies Close Doors to the Future	Should businesses be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals, agreeing to not to work for competitors?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/10/should-companies-be-allowed-to-make-workers-sign-noncompete-agreements	Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	false	false	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals
Jeff	6	0	Non-compete clauses are not about protecting proprietary information. That can be done with non-disclosure agreements. What they're really about is inhibiting the free market for labor. Employers use non-compete clauses to discourage employees from leaving. That saves the employer the cost and trouble of training a new worker, and it keeps wages down by restricting the employee's ability to leave if he or she does not get a raise. Non-compete clauses should be banned as a simple matter of fairness, and because competition for labor makes companies better.	12005807	Wed Jun 11 00:00:00 CEST 2014	When Companies Close Doors to the Future	Should businesses be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals, agreeing to not to work for competitors?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/10/should-companies-be-allowed-to-make-workers-sign-noncompete-agreements	Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	false	false	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals

I currently work for a sub 100 person company and we tried to hire someone who had been let go from a competitor 9 months earlier. The competitors was a large global company based in MA. We received a threatening letter from them about the non-compete. Because they are big and have more in annual profit than we have in annual revenue, we knew we could not challenge them in court and so we had to rescind the offer to the currently unemployed individual. This is how I have seen non-competes used.	12005115	Wed Jun 11 00:00:00 CEST 2014	When Companies Close Doors to the Future	Should businesses be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals, agreeing to not to work for competitors?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/10/should-companies-be-allowed-to-make-workers-sign-noncompete-agreements	Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	false	false	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals

BJ	12	0	I know of no small business whose life blood consisted of one or two products developed at high cost wherein those products were not protected by patents or copyrights. Ninety-nine percent of the small business non-competes I have seen try to prevent good salesmen from calling on their customers from the their former employer. The other one percent involved senior executives, were very explicit about the competitive competing firms, and were of sort duration. In most of these cases the employment contract of the hiring company called for the hiring company to defend the executive against legal action by his former employer under the non-compete. So, to come full circle, small business non-competes are almost always aimed at keeping good salesmen in chains.	12004103	Wed Jun 11 00:00:00 CEST 2014	When Companies Close Doors to the Future	Should businesses be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals, agreeing to not to work for competitors?	/roomfordebate/2014/06/10/should-companies-be-allowed-to-make-workers-sign-noncompete-agreements	Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals	false	false	Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals

bruce	4	0	First of all, the Palestinians live under occupation because Jordan, the original occupier left the territory to Israel after the 1967 war. What about the 20 years of Jordanian occupation from 1947-1967? Israel took over the care of the refugees of the 1948 War of Independence from Jordan. Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. For 20 years, the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers held the West Bank and Gaza refugees in camps, in poverty and riled up. It is the mindset of these Arab leaders who do not want to have a Jewish State side by side with Arab Muslims who have caused the misery of the Arab refugees for the past 66 years.	11653691	Sun Apr 27 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Hamas-Fatah Unity Lead to Mideast Peace?

Palestinians would remain second class citizens by virtue of the Israelis having developed both a wealthy economy and having developed and controlled both the modern infrastructure, businesses, and public institutions. The Palestinians would have to be given much of what is in Israeli hands and help them to learn how to manage it and money to support the transition from taxes upon the more well to do (Israelis) to achieve equality in a single state.

Scotty	2	0	Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.	11650685	Sat Apr 26 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Can Hamas-Fatah Unity Lead to Mideast Peace?

Millions have been poured into the Palestinian cause by its fellow Arabs unfortunately most of it has been for arms and continued war very little for economic development. If Saudi Arabia had given the money it has paid out to terrorists to stay out of their country to the Palestinians for economic development and provided real guidance in those areas there is no reason they would not be competing with Israel on the economic stage but that would not serve anyone but the Palestinians. The US is not the failure here. Those who say they love the Palestinians only seem to love them when they are fighting and dying. Hamas won't help change the course of this debate or this tragedy unless it has changed its stripes, something I very much doubt.

WJH	1	0	I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.	9830395	Tue Aug 27 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is an Attack on Syria Justified?

jy444ng	3	0	I have seen no convincing argument that a strike on Syria by the US & allies would accomplish anything positive. Regime change is not the goal. We might be able to slap Assad's hand, but will that change anything, including his behavior with respect to chemical weapons? It would be no more than a gesture, a futile attempt at face saving. The potential negative consequences are legion. Sorry to sound simplistic, but two wrongs don't make a right. Our strike will kill many people, likely more than the gas attacks. What makes us so high and mighty that we grant ourselves the right to kill a bunch of additional people to make a point? A point that will be either ignored or misinterpreted by most of those involved in the conflict? Justifying such an act requires us to assume that we own the moral high ground, but we do not. It will be an act of self-deluded narcissism of the highest order. And we will be a big step closer to a major war engagement likely including Iran.

In Syria's case, not responding to these atrocities will embolden the Assad regime and will encourage future chemical attacks.

Beethy	2	0	We cannot sit idly by and accept the Syrian government' actions, if there is clear evidence of the alleged atrocities. Sure, we were misled into Iraq and the non-existent WMD. We have to forget THAT mind-set. How clear and solid is the evidence of chemical weapons used against the Syrian people by the Assad regime? I don't buy the Russian claims. But we have to be very certain before we take any unilateral steps this time in that region. IF the allegations are true, no civilized country can watch it without doing something.

Ignorance of NYT readers is astounding; why don't you read other media for a change, and get out of the information bubble that is shaped by the state department. This foreign policy has been around for the last 2 decades and getting rid of Assad is one of critical components. Crushing of Syria will cut the supply chain to Hezbollah and secure peace for israel. There are other interests as well. Saudis would like to pipe gas to Europe and undermine the monopoly of Russian Gazprom. Europeans would like that too. Foreign policy had an article recently that when Saddam was gassing Iranians in the 80's, he was getting logistical support from USA.	9844415	Thu Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is an Attack on Syria Justified?

No good will come out of bombing Syria, but much worse may come out for not bombing Syria. Intervening in Syria must have a real purpose. The Administration hasn't given a purpose other than punishing Assad for using chemical weapons. That will not stop Assad. In fact it may even embolden him to use it indiscriminately. Then what? Topple Assad? Who will control Syria afterwards?

Orwell was right about almost everything, including his idea about perpetual war. Ever since Vietnam the United States Congress doesn't vote on a war. The chief executive and commander-in-chief decides to start flying the bombs, and they start flying, and people start dying. Will a war in Syria let some pressure out of the pressure cooker, or will it explode into World War III? The military-industrial corporations and cable TV stations will rake in the big dough (again!) when the bombs start flying. The lies and cover-ups are catching up with us. The truth about the saying what goes around comes around is true. America the beautiful... The foundation and working apparatus for an electronic-military police state are here.

Casual Observer	2	0	Forget the cruise missiles and air strikes without any real full scale attacks which threaten the target country's ability to conduct the egregious acts. All those do is destroy some buildings and kill more bystanders than malefactors. If we participate in any intervention it must be as a part of a significant and broad coalition. So far the U.N. inspectors have not been allowed to inspect. This must be made into a big issue both for Assad's people and for any others who are impeding the inspectors. It is important for the world to know who is doing who to who, here. We must remember that Assad is the leader of a dominant minority, not just some singular tyrant, and bringing him down means exposing that minority to the kinds of sectarian reprisals we saw in Iraq after Saddam was crushed, and that it absorbed our strategic land forces for over five years. That is not the way to go.	9833027	Tue Aug 27 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Is an Attack on Syria Justified?

Lookt at Libya -- we started out with R2P just to save those Jihadist in Benghazi from Qaddafi. Well it quickly morpher into regime change in violation of the UN SC resolution. So we acted outside the law. We didn't care we are the US - we are not bound by any LAW not even one passed in Congress. And regime change in Libya led to the muder of a US Ambassador -- does anyone think that what is about to happen will end any differently. The President will lie to us as we were lied to about NSA and lied to about US intentions in Libya. In another month we will be bleeding and dying in Syria to remove Assad and install Al Nusra in power -- the so called FSA will either defect to Al Nusra or be buthchered by them.

CAMeyer	9	0	An unfortunate example of agenda setting by the Times. No one argues that less experience would be a plus for a lawyer, a physician, a nurse, a journalist, a policeman, an accountant, or, for that matter, a fry cook. Yet the private education industry's rationale for hiring and retention policies that are clearly driven by minimization of labor costs and maximization of profits is somehow worthy of serious consideration. Similarly, we are asked to believe that talent, expertise, and wisdom in the realm of education is offered by wealthy philanthropists, corporate executives, consultants, and government officials, but not by those who actually teach students. Unfortunately, there's just too much potential profit to made to allow public education in its present form to remain. Teachers will in fact eventually be replaced by semiskilled educational associates who will facilitate delivery of uniform content centrally developed by corporations. Platform standardization will allow content development to be offshored. With any luck, my kids will be finished with school before that day comes.	9853817	Fri Aug 30 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Do Teachers Need to Have Experience?

Charter schools do not offer competitive salaries. In addition, charter school teachers have more duties and longer hours in school, so, after factoring in daily lesson planning on top of their extended hours, they work much longer, in poorer conditions (the shiny buildings don't mean good work conditions) with much lower salaries.

Charles	2	0	I was a public school teacher for 25 years. The large majority of teachers I observed were hacks on sinecure waiting for their pensions, resenting the students, the parents, the administration and the education professors (the last two mostly justly). There were exceptions, but not many. Enthusiasm is lost by the sixth or seventh year. One enthusiastic, dedicated young teacher is worth more to a child than many of these plodders, whose influence actually may be more negative than positive.	9846734	Thu Aug 29 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Do Teachers Need to Have Experience?

Jim R.	12	0	I agree with Princeton's move as a useful first (but small) step in addressing America's woeful inabilities to communicate around the world. But Betty is absolutely correct--the right and best place to teach foreign languages is as early as possible and over many years, while the mind is most plastic and language can be taught in the same manner we learn English--naturally, and without the mind numbing exercises that teach the infrastructure of a language--not how to actually use it.	20926552	Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should Foreign Language Classes Be Mandatory in College?

John Galt 48	39	0	I have a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. According to other comments on this article, I have no use for a foreign language - yet I'm fluent in two and can get by in two more. It's enabled me to work easily with multinational contractors, to better understand supply chains and logistics in Europe because I had to LISTEN more closely when it wasn't presented in English, to be perceived as a good representative of the US - not as someone who insists on English only and someone who pretends that speaking English LOUDER suddenly makes it comprehensible to non-English speakers. Even if a person never achieves fluency, the ability to try to reach across the language gap is invauable as a life skill.

VHZ	5	0	As an academic for more than 50 years, I say, especially around grading time, that every university should require two things: minimal competence in a (new) foreign language, and performance on a musical instrument. You can cheat or get around the requirements for all kinds of other academic subjects, but you either speak French in public, or you can't. You either play the Bach Invention, or you can't. Simple. You can't cram it, you can't cheat. Besides the obvious benefits of the learning processes in both of these activities, the study of each is a valuable exercise in integrity.

Jay Stone	1	0	It's a time-tested way of prompting students to consider other points of view. I'm a little stunned that Princeton would consider scrapping it. Estimates vary on what percentage of the world speaks or understands English - I've read between 12 and 25 percent - but even if you accept the higher of those numbers, that leaves three quarters of the world's population that does not. Jobs that require college degrees very often also require contact with people from other countries. To me it's clear that advanced education isn't complete without studying another language. Fluent in a second language? Take a third.	20937269	Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should Foreign Language Classes Be Mandatory in College?

comp	8	0	There are so many ancillary benefits to learning a language that it's hard to justify not making it mandatory. Learning a foreign language benefits brain heath by increasing one's 'cognitive reserve'. Languages differ from one another in the ideas they are able to express: French, for instance, has a more limited vocabulary than English but expresses many ideas much more precisely. Finally, for hundreds of years, if not since antiquity, knowing more than one language was de rigueur for an educated and civilized person. One was not even considered educated without familiarity with at least one classical language and at least two modern ones. It is only America hegemony and arrogance that has caused this intellectual tradition to be seen as superfluous.	20933238	Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should Foreign Language Classes Be Mandatory in College?

In retrospect Latin would have been the better way to go, since mastery of that makes learning the languages like French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish, very much easier to learn! I would recommend it, But it's 2016, and let's face it, if you lived in southern Brooklyn today, Russian, Ukrainian, Cantonese, Arabic, and Ghetto Yiddish is the way to go! However, if one lives in the United States as a whole, circa 2016, Mandarin, has got to be the way to go! Who knew?!!!

John Martin	3	0	Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary. Without this requirement colleges and universities will become increasingly untethered from a practice that has done as much as any other single practice to expand our sense that it is no mean feat to make sense of someone born in a land or in a time other than our own.	20930021	Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should Foreign Language Classes Be Mandatory in College?

Sierra	7	0	I have worked internationally for 15 years and knowing French, German, and Russian was a life saver. I learned French along with English in school, German came from my in-laws, and Russian was my first language and it came from my grandparents. When I was in college in the 1980s, everyone was required to take at least 1 year of a foreign language. Each major had its own language option(s). And yes, my major's options were French, Russian, and German. I took Russian so I could get better at reading and writing. Languages should start in elementary school, at least the very basics. In middle school, it would be great if students had options of French or German. Then in High School, options should include Mandrin, Korean, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, as well as French, German, Italian, and Russian. Our students are at a huge disadvantage in the global workforce by not having them speaking another language.

At lunch time, all the Engineers switch to their national language; and short of asking a question, you'll just be sitting there, silently eating your meal. In splendid isolation, as the saying goes. On occasion, the table may wander off into two or three languages. About 30% of EU professionals speak 3 or more languages.20% speak four or more. The same is true back in my office in Silicon Valley. Business is conducted in English, but if you want to go out for lunch with co-workers it can require knowing Telugu, Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, et al.

ACJ	4	0	The research on this issue is clear, which the Yale provost might read ---picking up a second language in college is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for adult learners ---that is not to say that there are students who do have a talent for second language acquisition, but most of us do not. Now having said that, the odds of learning a second language increase dramatically at the elementary level. We have a habit, when discussing educational matters, of aiming curricular reforms at high school and colleges, when, we should be focused on the age groups where learning a second language is optimum---so, instead of Yale, we should be looking at enlarging dual language programs at the K - 8 system.	20923226	Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should Foreign Language Classes Be Mandatory in College?

Linda	1	0	The NYT recently ran an article about how people lose the ability to make decisions as it gets later in the afternoon. The example given was that parole boards cease giving parole to prisoners whose cases come up in the afternoon, not because these inmated had worse cases but because , by afternoon, the human brain needs a break and decides not to decide. How does this new research fit into longer school days? Will late afternoon classes be useless? I know at work most people I know, including myself, run out of steam at about 3 p.m. If adults can't keep up to par all day, how are children expected to make decisions all day?	4592399	Tue Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the School Day Be Longer?

Linda	9	0	I was a straight A student. I was graduated with honors when I received my Master of Arts degree. I learned more outside of school than I ever learned inside, at least once I learned to read. School tends to be boring for both very intelligent students and not very smart kids. Textbooks are dull. The books in the library and the stores are interesting. Has anybody but me noticed that, although students in other countries score higher than Americans on standardized tests, innovation still comes out of America? Long schools days only take away from dreaming, creating, and inventing. Go ahead and make school days longer--if you want a bunch of robots for citizens.	4592423	Tue Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the School Day Be Longer?

Student	11	0	I'm in my Junior year in High School, and I take the hardest courses my school offers. I average 8 hours of homework every night with 6-7 hours of school in a day. I also work about 3 hours a day. I do not sleep. I spend most of my weekend sleeping, until Sunday where I do 12 hours of homework. I love school and I love learning, and I'd argue the school day needs to be extended. The teachers do not have enough time to teach us all we need to know, especially in AP courses. Thus, we have an incredible amount of homework, depriving us of sleep, and leading to the negative consequences Ms. Carskadon warns. So, as long as teachers have more time to teach while at the same time giving less homework, I'm all for extending the school day.	4592157	Tue Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the School Day Be Longer?

Tina	1	0	As a public school teacher, it is not my job to raise children. They have parents for that. Dumping more and more responsibilities into the schools' laps only enables the parents who are choosing to abdicate those responsibilities. While I recognize that there are many factors that make it challenging for some parents to fully meet their children's needs (physical, emotional, educational, economic, etc.), passing those off onto schools, as Canada advocates, is not the answer. I don't think we'll see any real change in this country until we address issues like poverty and working conditions (including the long hours that force parents to choose between seeing their children and feeding them). Incidentally, I am completely baffled and frustrated by Canada, whose success comes largely from the fact that his programs have taken huge steps to improve the living conditions of his students and their families--and then he turns around and credits that success to non-unionized teachers and extended school days. Really??	4594455	Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the School Day Be Longer?

Mr. Canada's suggestion might well be necessary for the schools he oversees. But most schools don't have the same problems, and for them a longer school day seems unnecessary. To bridge the achievement gap, we need to bring the bottom up. The top is for the most part where it ought to be.	4593567	Tue Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the School Day Be Longer?

Thinker	14	0	Both of my elementary age children are bored to tears at school everyday, from 8:30-3:00. In an effort to make everybody a winner, our schools have dumbed down the standards so much that our curriculum is now 2 grade levels below 20 years ago. Students have always had varying abilities, you cannot change nature. As it is school is just a place for my kids to socialize, as they learn practically next to nothing during Reading, Math, Social Studies. I wish school hours could be shortened to include only Recess, Library, Music, PE and Art so that I could have more time to teach my kids the real important stuff at home.	4592517	Tue Sep 27 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the School Day Be Longer?

Reviewing the citizenship of people already born here would result in endless paperwork and heavy expenses, and would force us to make difficult moral decisions, some of which we would undoubtedly get wrong. I don't think that a constitutional amendment is actually necessary to clarify that the meaning of the Constitution is not something that it clearly was not intended to be, though. Defining the meaning of ""under the jurisdiction of the United States"" to exclude those who entered the country illegally or are here on short term travel visas should only require a law saying as much. The courts could strike it down, I suppose, but it's far from clear that they should, and their decision would have to explain some interesting contradictions between their position and contradictory aspects of past immigration laws.

ETC	11	0	It may have made sense once upon a time but not anymore. I am liberal thinker and I don't mean to say that we need to deport people in mass or not have systems in place to care for newborns of any status who happen to be born here. But citizenship should be a priveledge that is applied for by families or legal representation in exceptional circumstances, and it should be earned thorugh a process by which it is clear the person (or family) is well invested in our culture and economy. I have two daughters born in Switzerland, neither of whom were offered Swiss citizenship at birth because the simple fact of their birth didn't make them Swiss. Under the current system it is simply too easy to take advantage of the current law and use automatic citizenship to take more than is earned. Again, I am not saying we shouldn't be a compassionate country, and how a new system is implemented would be a lengthy, difficult task, but it definitely should change.	15885882	Tue Aug 25 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Should 'Birthright Citizenship' Be Abolished?

As it is the Democrats not only excluded illegal squatters from the Affordable Care Act, they excluded their children, citizens of the United States from those benefits. Those children born in the United States, are citizens according to Democrat idealogy, and yet they intentionally exempted them from benefits because the parents are here illegally. How can these children be covered when there parents are exempted? A simple case in point, these children will never be able to be on their parents insurance until age 26, as well as other benfits, because their illegal parents are not required to have insurance under the ACA. Democrats failed the smell test. Leaving baby citizens with no insurance.

Judyw	44	0	Many countries who have had birthright citizenship have eliminated it. We are, I think, the only country left which has not made the intelligent decision to abandon birthright citizenship. In a time of high mobility it makes sense to end it. Look at the scam of birth tourism practiced by the wealthy of China or Pakistan. That is an abuse which should be ended tomorrow. Too many people today are taking advantage and misusing the law. Pregnant women cross the Rio Grande to give birth in the US, some US hospitals in Texas will accept a women from Mexico who is having a difficult birth to US hospitals to give birth ( we must make clear that this service does not give the child US citizenship or if it does we should end the service). Birthright citizenship is outdates and must be ended.	15878734	Mon Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Should 'Birthright Citizenship' Be Abolished?

In some cases they stay, and in others they leave with the American child. Those that leave will eventually reap the benefits of American citizenship without ever contributing to it. It's become status symbol for foreign nationals to have children with the blue and gold passport. This is reality; and I'm sure the founding fathers didn't have this in mind when the constitution was adopted.	15875797	Mon Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Should 'Birthright Citizenship' Be Abolished?

(2) No developed countries other than the US and Canada observe it and both countries are currently discussing eliminating it. (3) It incentivizes illegal immigration. (4) It incentivizes illegal immigrants having kids and the US taxpayer directly or indirectly pays for the maternity. (5) It allows children of illegal parents to qualify for the full array of US entitlements, that in most cases a legal immigrant family would not receive. (6) Over time, the Birthright Citizens, who only exist here because of the illegal entry and presence of their parents, become sufficiently numerous they can influence our politics and try to extort legalization for their parents.

The only exception to this broad principle might be war refugees. But people who come to the USA to deliver a child so that it can enjoy the fruits of citizenship , should not enjoy this privilege.

Paul Rosenberg	1	0	I'm a psychiatrist on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University, and although I now specialize in dementia I used to work heavily in addictions and chronic mental illness. Drugs of abuse and addiction tend to move in fads, fashions, and trends, and it is important for public health that doctors' training adjust to these constant changes. At this moment the trend is opioid addiction particularly prescription drugs. The trend is moving a bit back to heroin (because it's cheaper!) but prescription drug addiction is still a huge public health problem. We (doctors) created the problem (inadvertently) and we should help solve it. A brief web-based training is not too much to ask; for many doctors it will be redundant as is much of the ongoing training we are required to participate in; but it is important to spread the word widely in the medical community.	18435377	Thu May 05 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Opioid Training for Doctors Be Mandatory?

dave	2	0	The author assumes the conclusion about education on opioids- without providing evidence. Like Ioannidis said we have an epidemic of opinions in medicine today. Some studies have shown that education in opioids improves care. There is also studies showing education on pain care improves pain care. Education on opioids will miss the mark, in my opinion, if the goal is to improve pain care and prevent addiction to opioids. It is clear doctors do not wish to have education in either pain care or on opioids- as statements by the AMA and aafp and efforts by the MSSNY are indicative of. But being a doctor is not a god given right and society has the right to dictate to those who want to be doctors what education they need to obtain and maintain their license. So we should try to reeducate doctors in both using opioids and in pain care- its morally right and there is evidence that it can improve care.	18432416	Thu May 05 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Opioid Training for Doctors Be Mandatory?

Francis	2	0	Beyond any doubt, it should be. There are those who claim that such training occurs in medical school and at CME following graduation. Under whose auspices? Some Medical Schools have found it necessary to exclude Pharmaceutical Reps and others from access to their students and Residents on their premises. Many of these opioid manufacturers continue to fund various research and teaching projects at these hospitals and universities. It is a system full of conflicts, all of which do not favor the patient. Doctors and other providers continue to end up in court and jail because of intentional involvement in the cycle of drug abuse. Opioid training is an answer but may not be the only one. We may also need to clean up Faculties, test books and the way in which we choose those who enter medical school. Many doctors really feel that they do no wrong.	18468183	Mon May 09 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Opioid Training for Doctors Be Mandatory?

Glen	1	0	None of the five essays here discuss the importance of pain control at the end of life. A retired RN, with more than 7 years of a 3-decade career spent in hospice care, I have concerns about the future of opioid control of pain in that spectrum of medicine if draconian measures, as a result of inappropriate prescribing resulting in addiction and death, are implemented that restrict or make onerous the availability of drugs appropriate for the terminally ill. I absolutely agree that physicians should be trained, intensively, in the appropriate use of highly addictive analgesics, both for acute, chronic and, especially, diseases of the terminally ill. Please, whatever course you advocate, do not throw up roadblocks to terminal pain relief. (I intend, NYT Comments reviewers permitting, to copy and paste this comment to all five discussions.

It seems all the hysteria on the misuse of opioids has given rise to more government control in the doctor's office. The majority of patients who take these drugs take them responsibly. They do not take them for the high, they take them for just enough relief to help maintain normal function. Let's not make doctors afraid to take care of the suffering they encounter, let's help them learn to distinguish between the budding addict and the the poor soul who is legitimately suffering.	18432595	Thu May 05 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Opioid Training for Doctors Be Mandatory?

No doubt the overuse of opioids has stemmed from the moral laziness of doctors when it came to offer the right care for people in pain. Doctors and medicine is still remiss in developing and deploying good treatment for pain. And training based on the little that pain specialists know and do will be of too little help to people in pain.

h	10	0	Why are the trade names for these medications suddenly taboo in the news? Are the reporters for some reason not allowed to say Percocet, Vicodin, Hydrocodoe, suddenly, just like they were not allowed to say 'torture' . And of course, training is required. Doctors shoveled Hydrocodone at me after my back operation, 240 pills, and I needed exactly zero. It was weird. Not only that, an intelligent nurse took me off hydrocodone while I was in the hospital, saying it was not having a good effect on me, and that should have guided the exit prescriptions, also, instead of just getting the xerox copy from the already written doctors wrote orders. Doctors are not allowed to divorce their brains from their profession, despite the obvious example Ben Carson showed us of what type of skills make one a top surgeon.	18428098	Thu May 05 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Opioid Training for Doctors Be Mandatory?

Medication errors are not a problem just with one class like an opioid. To instruct students to use this for one problem and another for the next problem is inadequate training. They should be taught and know that every medication carries some baggage that can cause problems, even two aspirins	18436599	Fri May 06 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Opioid Training for Doctors Be Mandatory?

Justice Holmes	1	0	I see no reason why this has to be an either or situation. Doctors should be trained about the prescribing of opioids as it is apparent that they are either ignorant or negligent in their prescribing practices. Imagine a doctor having the ability to check to make sure a patient isn't getting more than one prescription for an opioid by going to a computer and looking it up but chooses not to....is that good medicine?

papabear	3	0	The right to vote is already protected in many ways. That said, it is also one of the greatest privileges offered to the American people, and the idea that a privilege should not require some effort to take advantage of has wrongly become embedded in too much commentary in this country. We have freedom of speech, legally protected, but with political correctness rampant in our universities and communities, and people (often from the same disadvantaged groups complaining about voting rights) demonstrating and shouting down any opinions but theirs, I have to say that protection of folks relative to laws is a meaningless protection at best. Indeed, if those folks worried about voting rights took as much time voting and making sure they can as they did demonstrating about it, there would not be a problem with peoples ability to vote at all. And don't even get me started on government overreach at being big brother that makes us afraid to say anything in public, out loud, or online. So much for free speech! Let's protect voting the same way????!!!!!	13241684	Tue Nov 04 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should Voting Be a Constitutional Right?

Kevin Brock	1	0	The right to vote is enumerated more than any other right. And while no right is absolute, this right is, or should be, easier to exercise than any other right. Barriers to vote such as those enacted here in North Carolina serve no purpose other than to disenfranchise citizens. These barriers exist in many forms, with the photo ID requirement being the tip of the disenfranchisement iceberg. These tactics abridge not only the right to vote, but violate the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, and create the very taxation without representation that the founders rebelled against.	13238401	Tue Nov 04 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should Voting Be a Constitutional Right?

Steve Austin	1	0	The liberals' contributions to this section are basically saying that two Articles and four Amendments will fix what two Articles and three Amendments haven't. Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not. They'll end up simply voting for the first name, and when that is a GOPer, we'll have to keep watch over the bridges in the big-city liberal-statist philosophical ghettos/campuses.	13244428	Wed Nov 05 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should Voting Be a Constitutional Right?

Robert Carabas	8	0	"It is voter ID that is ""a solution in search of a problem."" Where studies have been done into number voter fraud less than a hand full can be shown in any given state. But the solution to those 4 or 5 cases of fraud is to allow a political fraud preventing 600,000 from voting in states like Texas. Over 4% of the voters and a large margin to overcome in any election. And it worth noting that those who will be unable to vote are Democratic voters. Student ID card issued by the state university systems will not do as ID, student vote heavily Democratic. And of course the poor are targeted.

With rules like the ID has to have an expiration date on it or it is invalid or requiring several copies of documents then raising the cost of those copies ten fold or the need for bills in the person's name with the physical address so that renters and people with post office boxes and married women could be kept from getting the ID. We all know what is really going on, the only solution looking for a problem is voter fraud claims by republicans. It is just an excuse to let the worst people in the country skate unhindered into office by cheating and discriminating.

Kevin Brock	1	0	I believe that the right to vote is sufficiently enumerated without having to go through the amendment process. Instead of another amendment, we need elected officials who take seriously their obligation to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies - including those who would disenfranchise millions of American citizens. We need judges who clearly understand that a requirement to present one's driver's license at the polls violates the 24th amendment, as the driver's license fee is a tax. We need to rise up against efforts to disenfranchise college students through various technicalities in residency requirements as violations of the equal protection clause. Here in North Carolina, the NAACP, led by Rev. William Barber, rose up against the draconian voter suppression laws in the Moral Monday movement that swept our state. This movement needs to continue to grow, to rival the NRA is political power as the voice to protect our 15th/19th/24th/26th amendment rights.	13238515	Tue Nov 04 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should Voting Be a Constitutional Right?

LA Hamblen	2	0	The Constitution needs no amending. Very simply, if a person has no photo ID, which, in today's society, makes their alleged inability to vote the least of their problems. then the states should supply one free of charge and just for voting. I doubt the cost would be that substantial to the states as I doubt this is as large a group as the NYT would have us believe. Beyond that, when, in many elections, less than 20% of the registered voters bother to show up in the first place, it would seem that we as voters suppress ourselves far more effectively than any voter ID laws.	13249305	Wed Nov 05 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should Voting Be a Constitutional Right?

Its not 1865 and the vast majority of African Americans have photo IDs, otherwise they would not be able to do ordinary activities like buy beer or cash a check. Its also dubious to claim that same day registration and early voting impact one group more than another. It was not all that long ago when there was no early voting or absentee ballots, you had to show up on that day in November. Those are minor issues about convenience and reflect the soft nature of our modern society where people simply can't be inconvenienced by having to show up to vote on a certain day. I've used absentee ballots and appreciated the convenience, but its a minor thing and has nothing to do with race or ethnicity.	13240402	Tue Nov 04 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should Voting Be a Constitutional Right?

According to Federalist Paper 51, citizens are a part of the balance of power and are to exercise some leverage over all three branches of government. We currently have a Supreme Court that has prostituted our constitutional rights with its Greece NY decision allowing legislative bodies to prescribe sectarian prayers; the Hobby Lobby decision that gives non-living entities (corporations) the right to impose the religious beliefs of the owners over their employees First Amendment religious freedom rights, and the Boston decision that allows domestic terrorists to assault, harass and intimidate citizens who go to family planning clinics.

Colenso	1	0	'Nonprofit' is a misnomer mainly used in the USA. The rest of the English-speaking world typically talks about 'not-for-profits'. Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit', apparently interchangeably with 'nonprofit'. All nonprofits and not-for-profits need to aim to do better than break even, and create at least a small surplus, in a fiscal year in order to buffer them against a loss in the next. Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. The issue is clouded by the fact that most Americans and others evidently don't understand what a nonprofit or not-for-profit is.	13122967	Thu Oct 23 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Tax Break for Sports	Should pro sports leagues enjoy nonprofit status?	/roomfordebate/2014/09/03/should-pro-sport-leagues-get-tax-breaks	Sport leagues should enjoy nonprofit status	Sport leagues should not enjoy nonprofit status	false	false	Sport leagues should not enjoy nonprofit status

Janice	1	0	"The majority of gun-toting activists, like this one, like to act as if they want to arm us all out of great concern about rapists and predators, which is a heartless tactic to get more women on their side. Yet, the fact is more guns and gunowners result in more harm to women, most often in domestic violence, something a decent professor of law should know. And most college women would not realistically be at an advantage even if armed at the fraternity parties, where preying upon them often occurs. Perhaps he should try to replace some of those in the growing exodus of more thoughtful professors from UT, where he and his students could soon defend one another and even potentially have a good ole shootout with one another should tensions arise in Austin. The claim that ""armed citizens frequently save lives and prevent violent crimes, often without firing a shot"", is largely a myth and not backed up with any valid stats, though it is true that most law-abiding gunowners have a dream about saving others ironically from fellow gunowners at some point, and it may seem like a nice dream."	18717634	Thu Jun 02 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Guns Be Permitted on College Campuses?

L'Osservatore	7	0	Gun owners tend to much more careful with guns than, say, a liberal leaving drugs out where children can reach them. The salient thing about school teachers or college students HAVING the right to carry a gun is that there is simply no blanket reliance for the criminal intruder that everyone he sees will not be armed. This fact, hated by progressives, is the key. It never involves everyone with that right taking advantage of it.	18720058	Fri Jun 03 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Guns Be Permitted on College Campuses?

Doug Giebel	28	0	Some have questioned whether a gun-carrying woman with a gun pressed against her head would have prevailed had she drawn her weapon. We don't know, but it seems doubtful. Many college students love parties, binge drinking and the problems (including anger, fights and sexual abuse) created by those situations. College students also face emotional problems that do or can lead to suicide, and a gun is the easy exit choice -- as it was many years ago when a college freshman friend of mine took his life. Troubled high school and college students are frequently in the news for causing mayhem and carnage on campus. Generally those so inclinded use surprise as a strategy. We don't know the outcomes if other students and teachers packed weapons. Speculation is easy. What outcome if the law required every person over 17 to carry a loaded weapon? Do we really want to find out? At a controversial football game, would someone kill the umpire?

The growing acceptance of the idea that America is an intrinsically violent society is part of so many of our problems.

Bill	35	0	The day guns are allowed into my college classroom is the day I stop teaching, and that feeling is shared by the vast majority of my faculty colleagues. American higher education is the best in the world - but that would quickly change if guns were allowed on campuses. The idea that more guns are the solution to gun violence simply defies reason - and if you believe that, Ms. Collins, you apparently learned nothing in college. There are non-lethal alternatives for self-defense: mace, pepper spray, etc. If you could have drawn a pistol quickly enough to defend yourself (questionable, if you were taken by surprise), you certainly could have fired a can of pepper spray just as quickly. A society in which each person is responsible for his or her safety is not a civilized one - indeed that is the very definition of barbarism. No, police cannot prevent every crime, but placing our safety in their hands is vastly superior to the alternative.	18690126	Tue May 31 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Guns Be Permitted on College Campuses?

Are more student dying there as a result of shootings? The answer of course is NO in both cases. Did anyone really need to debate about this? Just the idea that someone can think about something like this is sick and a sign of a dangerous deterioration of the expectations we as a so called civilized society have about each another. The other question is: why are so many shootings happening in USA campuses?

This tells me everything I need to know about both this man and the state of our government run secondary education. In that, it is not so much education as it is indoctrination of young adults. Most of the adults that will be carrying a firearm will be 21, have gone through a background check on both the Federal and state level, and in many cases gone through some sort of required training. These are the most law abiding, mature, and responsible people in society.

OHCelt	5	0	After 35 years as a college professor, I see the introduction of firearms on to college campuses as a potential disaster. This is an environment in which young people, often for the first time in theri lives, are trying to navigate their way through the world at large. Examinations, personal relationships, and other factors create stresses, in some cases more than they can cope with. I would not like to face a student who feels aggrieved about a bad grade in the likelihood that they might have a firearm under their jacket. Nor should in classroom discussions, often heated at times, be conducted under such an environment. No, college is a place where children come to become adults, and minimizing threats of violence is one of the controls that we need to make to make this passage safer.	18701005	Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Guns Be Permitted on College Campuses?

Henry Bowman	6	0	Here's the bottom line. People with concealed carry permits have been background-checked and vetted by the state, for both character and competence. They carry on streets, in supermarkets, theatres, restaurants, public transportation, workplaces, and most other places you frequent every day. You may not be aware of it, but they are there. The question you have to ask yourself is, what is so magical about an imaginary line around a college campus that suddenly changes people who are not a public danger outside that line? Other states have been allowing legal weapon on campus for most of a decade, and have had zero incidents. This is nothing but phobia, pure and simple. If you think that universities are somehow naturally constitution-free zones, this says something about you that you may want to reconsider.	18693756	Tue May 31 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Guns Be Permitted on College Campuses?

Bill Mosby	3	0	I live about 2 blocks from the University of Utah campus, where concealed carry has been permitted for something like 5 years now, but only for people who meet the usual criteria for such which means only those 21 or over can legally carry. Utah is also a state which is getting used to open carry. I've seen examples of that practice maybe every third month or so. That is also permitted on campus here, but only for concealed carry permit holders. I take walks on that campus and I rarely think about guns being near me because they will be near me pretty much any where I go in Utah. When I go to the 24 hour fitness gym at Trolley Corners about 2 miles away I sometimes do remember the mass shooting that occurred at Trolley Square just across the street about 9 years ago. The gym is in a basement which would be a hard to escape shooting gallery if somebody wanted to shoot up the place. But even there it usually doesn't cross my mind most of the time. Maybe I'm getting a little bit too used to the concealed and open carry idea.	18694058	Tue May 31 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Guns Be Permitted on College Campuses?

Michael S	2	0	The police notoriously want a monopoly of firepower, if for nothing more to avoid career ruining mistakes such as shooting the good guy - we all know that some police are not that choosy about who they shoot. For me the thought of students helplessly slaughtered at Columbine and Virginia Tech while the police waited outside for the gunfire to stop is enough to prefer the possibility that an armed student or teacher could stop such a massacre. We are again carrying culture so he same people we carry firearms on campus presumably carry outside school and the students and teachers encounter these same people off campus. Not much increased risk, but with the possibility of avoiding a slaughter while the police sit on their hands. Never forget that legally the police have no duty to protect you, you have the duty to protect yourself - the nlaw says the police are only there to assist you.	18693452	Tue May 31 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Guns Be Permitted on College Campuses?

Bill Levy	1	0	First these students in low income poverty neighborhoods destroyed their public schools because of violence and refusing to learn and disruptive behavior. They thought that Charter Schools were the solution and like taking residents from these neighborhoods and relocating them at taxpayer expense to better neighborhoods (mostly white) they would change their behavior. It didn't work and it couldn't work and it will never work. Look at St. Louis, MO and their experiment with their dilapidated, violent housing projects when the Clinton administration gave them housing vouchers to move to white neighborhoods like Ferguson and see what happened. Good for the Charter Schools for expelling these trouble makers unless we're prepared to threaten the parent with loss of Food Stamps, Title 8 Housing, Medicaid and other entitlements nothing is going to ever change. 'It's not the schools. It's not the teachers. It's the parent whose responsible because they never had to be responsible before in their life.

Craig Millett	9	0	Discipline is the first thing that any school worth its salt needs to teach. It is most important to teach respect for others, particularly fellow students who are there to learn not to be disrupted and distracted by this sort of thing. Freedom has become a useless trope in our society because we attach no responsibility to it. Long ago when I was attending an excellent public school we students would not have tolerated a person like the one you describe and let me say we were a remarkably tolerant class.	13563182	Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CET 2014	Keeping Only the Best Behaved	Are charter schools, with their high rates of suspension and expulsion, cherry-picking students?	/roomfordebate/2014/12/10/are-charter-schools-cherry-picking-students	Charter schools are cherry-picking students	Charter schools are not cherry-picking students	false	false	Charter schools are cherry-picking students
Goose	20	0	As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student. While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student.

Ann	18	0	I am a NYC teacher who has taught in public, charter and now private school. My two children attend a gifted and talented public school and private school. I would never send my child to a charter school. Why? Because they will never learn how to be creative, independent and self reliant. Some of my best students have defied me in their writing, their words and their actions, albeit respectfully. In a Charter environment that is grounds for reprimand, suspension and expulsion. Any parent reading this should support local public schools and fight for more G&T programs and AP programs. Supporting Public School is the only way to ensure that we have a strong active middle class. If you do not believe me name any politician, middle management executive or faculty member whose children attend a Charter School.

At Success, the first round of the lottery uses a computer algorithm to choose kids; when those families decline or are found ineligible, Success doesn't have to blindly choose anymore - they can go into the 'wait list' pool and select the kids they think will have the fewest academic, behavioral, language, or special needs issues.	13557962	Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CET 2014	Keeping Only the Best Behaved	Are charter schools, with their high rates of suspension and expulsion, cherry-picking students?	/roomfordebate/2014/12/10/are-charter-schools-cherry-picking-students	Charter schools are cherry-picking students	Charter schools are not cherry-picking students	false	false	Charter schools are cherry-picking students
Betsy	3	0	This looks like a half solution. We need to start by acknowledging that students who want to learn need an environment where they can. Charter schools can do a good job of this. But the other half of the problem - what happens to the disruptive students also needs to be addressed adequately. Dumping the troubled students is not a solution for the dumpees. The reasons for disruptive behavior are wildly varied. We need to be willing to take the next step and work with them too, on their level(s) to bring them along. And yes, they probably will be more costly to educate than charter school students, as they are undoubtedly needier.	13563613	Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CET 2014	Keeping Only the Best Behaved	Are charter schools, with their high rates of suspension and expulsion, cherry-picking students?	/roomfordebate/2014/12/10/are-charter-schools-cherry-picking-students	Charter schools are cherry-picking students	Charter schools are not cherry-picking students	false	false	Charter schools are cherry-picking students

Brian Riley	1	0	I meant: equal treatment/equal protection. To elaborate, that is surely part of the rationale for the IDEA law in the first place, but we shouldn't then go on to debate the meaning of IDEA without contextualizing things according to the underlying issues. Some deaf children (actually, the vast majority of deaf children who are not hard of hearing) will need to be educated primarily through natural sign language. In the US this means American Sign Language--with English as a second language. This is the only way that a truly equal education can be provided, not be pretending that if we just try to maximize integration with hearing children that that will address the issue.	4266489	Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Do States Need Schools for the Deaf?

As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, ""People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry"" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which ""has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the ""Least Restrictive Environment"" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted ""inclusion is illusion,"" that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA."	4266102	Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Do States Need Schools for the Deaf?

So, advocates for closing these schools to cover a budgetary gap would seem to be saying ""hey, it's ok to deny rights to a segment of society if they're not large enough to protest"". Bad enough that our educational system is inadequate as it is, but to deny a whole class of people anything approaching an adequate education is ludicrous.

Just a thought	1	0	I encounter deaf people from time to time in my work. I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it. ASL was quite an advancement at its inception, but it is fast outliving its usefulness and becoming a burden rather than the liberator it was intended to be.	4268366	Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Do States Need Schools for the Deaf?

Laurie Saidiner	22	0	As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others.	4264489	Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Do States Need Schools for the Deaf?

Kevin Rica	1	0	"Dr Gallardo says: ""Not surprisingly, labor accounts for 46 percent of all variable costs for growers (based on Washington-grown Gala apples)."" Now let's ask what Dr. Gallardo has avoided telling us: ""What percentage of the FULL costs, including land does labor cost."" In most agriculture, land rents, the landowners' profits are the major chunk of full costs. If labor costs went up, even before prices went up, the price of land would go down, bearing the brunt of the increased cost of labor. There is no reason fore the land to disappear. There are not that many alternative uses. It's not like farmers, who claim to have built the land with their own two hands, will stop building land. Why do we insist on keeping many hundreds of thousands of people in deep poverty to keep fruit cheap and landowners rich? Why is that a fair policy?

JLK	1	0	When I read all the different opinions on this topic, I can boil it down to two statements. 1) The cost of farm labour is a small faction of the eventual cost of foods. 2) The current American agricultural system vitally depends on having a supply of unskilled labourers who are willing to work seasonal jobs with long, grueling hours, unsafe conditions, and little to no chance of advancement. A sufficient pool of people does not exist among legal American workers.	4373275	Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Real economists who have really looked at this have discovered that the actual cost at retail of not using illegal labor is very small, under 5%. The actual farm labor costs are swamped by capital costs, storage, transportation and distribution, spoilage and retail markup. In addition, there are visa programs for temporary seasonal workers that would allow farmers to get what they claim they need, but they would then have to provide less exploitative wages and conditions.	4371377	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Ruralist	4	0	I see one assumption here that creates a false hindrance to finding solutions. I would think that an apple grower with no harvest labor would very wiling to replant to mechanically harvestable trees. There is no value in having trees whose many apples never leave the orchard. The exception, and perhaps the reason for making the assumption, are those growers who are so stubborn that they would rather go out of business thinking themselves proven right.

Rick	1	0	Evidently the increase in agricultural workers salaries would eat into the growers profits. The opposition of the Farm lobby is indicative of that. Also, where would the replacement workers come from? Maybe some of the readers posting comments in favor of E verify would like to volunteer. And don't forget all the other sectors of the economy where immigrant labor is used. Yes, you can probably attract American workers with Google pay/benefit packages, but the Growers would go out of business due to the costs. And then, when the economy picked up, those workers would immediately move back to the city and we would be back to square one.	4371893	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Just when we are finally paying serious attention to getting people to eat more fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the costly obesity our society is suffering from, with all its attendant effects.

Omar W	25	0	The only way to attract Americans to work in the farms is to (1) pay the workers a decent wage; (2) make the job year-round, not just seasonal; (3) provide health insurance benefits; and (4) offer 401K opportunity. The prices of fruits and vegetable will go up. But as Professsor Philip Martin points out, the net cost to the consumers will be minimal.

Ho	5	0	Or farming of this type would just move to mechanization to keep costs down. In the late 70s/early 80s, the United Farm Workers did a lot to prevent academic research into mechanization of California farming, and wanted the state to impose taxes on mechanized fruit and vegetable harvesters. I think their efforts even included a terrorist attack on the Ag-engineering department at UC-Davis (although maybe that's just something I just heard?). But it's 2011, and I doubt they are strong enough to stop mechanization these days.	4366654	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Winthrop Staples	3	0	This nation is going to have to admit that its tradition of luring more than a million poor unskilled immigrants to this country a year, with the express purpose of exploiting them with below living wage wages (and then taxing our dwindling middle class to get social service subsidies needed to keep them alive), is complex comoflaged form of slavery that is no more moral than the formal black slavery that so oppressed and humiliated our nation. It must stop now. If we have to pay a bit more for food so be it. No one accepts former complaints that ending black slavery would raise the cost of cotton cloth, so why do we dare mention the cost of ending agricultural worker slavery. Mechanize these picking jobs and pay American workers a decent wage to do the work of several immigrant slaves as we have done in every other industry. Farmers and other businesses who can not make a profit without slave labor should go out of business or get into another business.	4371398	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Art	2	0	Justifying Illegal workers on the cheap products they produce is just another example of privatize the benefits but socialize the costs. The benefits come to mainly the business owners who can produce cheaper products and their by increase their profit margin. Plus the works are less likely to complain if they are mistreated. However the poor old taxpayer is left to pay for the schools, the health care, food stamps etc, etc for these people and yes the baby delivery costs as they all try to have that anchor baby. Massive illegal immigration has become a disaster for the US that will permanently change it forever. Maybe the US should just give up and cede the Southern States of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to Mexico.	4371131	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Farmer's Granddaughter	3	0	There would be very little difference in the price of fruits and vegetables if the farmers paid a reasonable wage. They'd need to do it together to not harm each other in the food market, that's what the unions and cooperatives are for. And we really need to license the labor contractors. So that they lose their licenses if they don't provide adequate water and toilets to workers in the fields. No farmer wants a dead worker featured in their harvest. It brings a farmer's competency into question among the community. Mostly, farmers who pay less than good wages are megafarms and cheaters. They like illegal aliens because they can unload the costs associated with hiring workers onto the neighboring communities. And because these workers are less likely to know and object when they are being exposed to pesticides or abuse.	4370444	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

What he said was usually true. When we needed extra help to pull up grape vineyards 10 car loads of guys [two to five guys per car] from the Ontario unemployment office came out at 6:00 a.m..

Julie Dahlman	3	0	One of the main premises that Americans are used to inexpensive fruits and vegetables? Where are fruits and vegetables inexpensive? Most American families here in the West cannot afford to purchase very many $.85 oranges, apples. Beans and zucchini $1.29 lb. Broccoli and cauliflower $.89 lb., tomatoes $1.29 - 2.29, corn $.50-.75 an ear. Fruits and vegetables take a big chunk out of your food budget.

Bruce Bender	7	0	Aren't these the same farmers that jump up and down screaming about illegal immigration when the kids want to go to school? The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.	4367932	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Michael D. Houst	4	0	There is a country-wide stigma against agricultural work. Part of that is due to hold overs from the slavery period. Part of that is due to a perception of minimum wage or less work. What we really need, and are seeing in some of these younger farmers, is a new class of people. People who are extremely intelligent, very hard working, who understand mesh networks, cellular and microbiology, organic chemistry, geology, hydrology, pest control, and synergistic relationships. And we need to get the word out that that's what this new age of farming is all about, and not using ignorant, illegal immigrants.	4367597	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Robert C. Leif	8	0	Only Karina Gallardo mentioned automation. The importation of farm laborers will increase our population and only temporarily provide farm laborers. Hopefully, the children of the farm laborers will be educated and find better jobs. The use of imported farm laborers should only be considered a temporary solution. An alternative needs to be sought. This means that a significant amount of money must be allocated to the development of robots to do the picking. Robots have significant advantages over human including their willingness to do unpleasant jobs. They also may have better ability to detect the ripeness and quality of crops plants. Robots have the advantage of being able to sense light outside of the visible range and to be equipped with ultrasonic and other sensors. One potential benefit of a decrease in defense spending is that some very qualified members of the defense industry could be motivated to work on farm automation. Some medical imaging companies probably have relevant technology.	4366428	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Luigi	4	0	I find it hard to believe that Dr. Roberts is a Southerner; if he were he might realize how many of the arguments used to justify the need for illegal labor are so eerily similar to those that were used to justify our own peculiar institution 150  years ago. This does not make American agricultural interests any more evil than antebellum white Southerns were; just shortsighted and maybe a little mule-headed, like Southerners were and often still are. My advice to the American agriculture industry is to look down the road at how you will be viewed decades from now and get on the right side of history while you can.	4371579	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Kurt	6	0	If we are that dependent upon the labor of immigrants (and I suspect we are), we should formalize the terms of our mutual interests by expanding the numbers of those allowed into the country to work legally while also enforcing the immigration laws to ensure those quotas are not exceeded. Perhaps we can set up some kind of regional clearing houses through which farmers can submit their anticipated labor needs for the season, which the government will assist in providing vetted immigrant labor from among those registering with it overseas as available for such placement. Again, though, we have no business exploiting foreign labor. If someone is good enough to build America, he is good enough to make his permanent home here and to become one of us.	4370460	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

Deborah	2	0	Mining is also an intolerable job, but people do it because they are paid much more than they could make at any other available job, I believe about $60K/year which is good money in the poor parts of the country.

Elaine Bennis	23	0	Ms. Bedolla's job is to lobby for illegal workers, and this fact makes all of her arguments subject to question. This is standard advocacy talk- the illegal's do the work American's won't do/can't do, and her Georgia example where former convicts, hardly a representative population, were cited as evidence is typical of the distortions practiced by these advoctes. If the farmers want legal workers, then they should pay them a living wage, and Americans should pay the higher resulting prices for the food that they consume .The implication that American's are not hard workers is not borne out by our history.	4368020	Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Could Farms Survive Without Illegal Labor?

The Philadelphia police superintendent, Charles Ramsey, who used to be in charge of Washington D.C. police, recently asked the Justice Department to review the Philly police and make recommendations. Ramsey saw that better procedures and training in D.C. ended up dramatically reducing firearms use by police and saving lives.

Listen	2	0	This is scapegoating at its best. How could it be murder if it wasn't premeditated? On top of that, this is yet another case where the person under arrest struggled with and attacked the police officer! What kind of person does that? An upstanding citizen? Obviously someone who has zero fear of authority or respect for the law. In a society where ordinary people do not fear the police or the law, you will have nothing but crime and chaos -- like in any of those 3rd world countries in Africa or Central America. The media's manipulation and exaggeration these incidents, turning each into yet another race victimhood incident rather than what it really is, another case of embolden criminal resisting arrest, will only further embolden more criminals while further tying the hands of the police. We will see more and more of these resisting arrest incidents, or more instances of police officers being attacked. The media has to stop being so one sided just because race is involved, and stop fanning the flame!

Perhaps the black lives matter will lead to a new civil rights movement that finally removes the cultural burden of our slavery and Jim Crow past.	14680951	Sat Apr 11 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Do Police Use Deadly Force Too Often?

Joe Cigliano	12	0	there is no room for debate. Police in the United Staes have shot and killed more people in the month of March, than police in Great Briton have shot and killed in the last 100 years. Don't bother trying to correct for demographics, there is no way to make this fact correct. It just can't be squared. Police in the U.S. Have been taught it is OK to kill someone in there own defense, it is not. It is always murder when you take a life, and should always be investigated as murder. If you want balance, then every one who shoots some one, police or not, should be charged with murder, and investigated from that perspective. There should be no special rules for police or not.	14673545	Fri Apr 10 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Do Police Use Deadly Force Too Often?

Markl1214	19	0	Police operate under stress. True. However, what is becoming more apparent is that officers for whatever reason are increasingly just too afraid of their job to be trusted with firearms. Rather than engaging a suspect with less than lethal force and running some risk of injury, police officers are becoming ever more reliant on deadly force to eliminate the risk. People are being shot in circumstances in which a cop of a generation ago never would have unholstered his weapon. Police are perpetually saying they feared for their life in circumstances where no such risk was apparent. In effect, they resort to killing people because they are not tough enough to handle the situation with less violence.

Mike	1	0	Of course all residents, regardless of background, are human beings and need to be treated like human beings. Identity cards help do that. But what would really do the most to uphold the humanity of everyone is to uphold the rule of law. You shouldn't be able to get a job without correct authorization to work. The reason is simple: unauthorized workers impact the labor market and drive down wages, especially for low skilled workers. Employers who hire unauthorized workers need to be punished so severely that they never do it again. Punishment for hiring unauthorized workers needs to be so frequent that behavior changes. Our millions of human beings living here who are unauthorized to work will either 1) become authorized or 2) return home to a place where they can improve their lives through work.	11179191	Mon Feb 17 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should All Immigrants Get ID Cards?

Joe	2	0	It's funny that liberals would endorse government ID programs, but times have changed. When I was young in the late '70s and early '80s, I was adamantly against any type of mandatory government issued ID. I was then and still am a liberal/progressive individual, and I have always been pro-privacy rights. But in today's world, where every entity we deal with in commerce has every speck of data on us, there's really nothing to fight about anymore. In fact, it would be much easier if we all had a government ID. The ID could take the form of a state driver's license or state ID. It must be free to obtain and universally available. It could have a marker on it to show if we are citizens, non-citizens here legally, or non-citizens here for only a period of time. If this were the case, we'd no longer have these debates about IDs and employment, voting, housing, serving on a jury, commerce and travel. The only reason to oppose a national ID is because you want to ensure that people here illegally can still participate in all functions that a citizen can, and that's not a good reason.	11165334	Fri Feb 14 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should All Immigrants Get ID Cards?

casual observer	1	0	The difference between documented and undocumented is clearly that the documented are identified by official documents while the undocumented are not. Providing ids means that the holders are identified by official documents. While those who applied before coming here are eligible for whatever their documents stipulate those who just showed up have whatever they have been able to take for themselves. De facto the undocumented become documented regardless of whether they followed the official rules or ignored them, and both are effectively officially entitled to act however they have been. Effectively the IDs would make people into legitimate residents and workers, making visas and work permits meaningless obstacles to anyone who wishes to live and to work here. It would be better to just provide all undocumented with legal status provided that they apply and complete the formal process. At least the brazen criminals might be identified and deported.	11165438	Fri Feb 14 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should All Immigrants Get ID Cards?

Ralph	3	0	Actually, it's a great idea, especially for law enforcement. Given that most illegal or undocumented people exists as electronic phantoms, with fake names or numbers, having a real set of ID, even if foreign derived, can be the loose thread needed to provide police with details on just who someone is. Police can then apply to the home country of a suspect to check for wants and warrants; if anything, it no longer allows the undocumented to hide in the shadow of anonymity as the government will now have access to a name, face, and fingerprint. It's an excellent idea.	11163402	Fri Feb 14 00:00:00 CET 2014	Should All Immigrants Get ID Cards?

BART had its opponents but is now an essential public service. Then there is Los Angeles: we tore up the Red Car service in belief that freeways were the ultimate solution. They weren't.. Then folks fought against new rail systems for 20-30 years before we were finally able to embark on new systems that now enjoy high ridership levels and public approval.

In agreement with you Peter, that not only will it create jobs and create a more sustainable mode of transportation, but in addition, create hubs of commerce that are attached to the rail system. Plans show well designed station centers that integrate commercial spaces and could also provide mobile business centers. If executed very well and with innovation, the future could hold a whole new way of doing business and working in general. It would also alleviate the pressured economics of centralized Bay Area.

rad28	8	0	A mass transportation system with 'last mile augmentation' is essential to 21st century travel. At some point along the cost curve, it has got to be cheaper to travel en-mass as opposed to individually. Zip cars or some equivalent are all that one needs to make it from the home to the station, and from the destination station to the final destination. If we could do that seamlessly, we could change the transportation paradigm and radically reduce both the cost and the 'time waste' of transportation in the US. High speed rail alone is not enough, but it's probably a necessary component.	5376549	Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Does California Need High-Speed Rail?

Russell Wylie	2	0	With regard to the assertion that larger airplanes carrying more people will accommodate higher passenger volumes as opposed to more flights (and runways) for conventional aircraft (737s, etc.), not so. An Airbus 380 or Boeing 787 cannot be economically operated between San Francisco and LA at prices and costs competitive with smaller passenger planes. Hence, without relieving SF-LA air traffic with high speed rail, our airspace will not be able to handle the traffic.

That's what I don't get about this high-speed rail proposal, it's obsession with a few big cities while the rest of the system languishes like it's been for decades. I'm perfectly fine with existing speeds, but there are far too many gaps in the existing system for convenience. Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus. If they want some faster routes, why not lay on some EXPRESS trains which do not stop at the smaller cities in between? Lastly the biggest problem in public acceptance is the sorry state of many stations.

cgopal	5	0	The only people who would benefit from this are the construction companies, their lobbyists, and the politicians they pay - all at taxpayer expense. The money should be spent (if any should be spent at all) on upgrading the local infrastructure, the freeways and local mass transit. Furthermore, there just isn't the voiume demand (except in the bloated projections of the supporters who will make money off this) to justify it economically. As one of the commentators so rightly put it - it would be a waste of money, for years to come.	5373430	Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Does California Need High-Speed Rail?

Ben Smith	15	0	I'm as big of an environmentalist as they come and support massive investments in public transportation projects. But I'm worried that the resources going into this project arent wise. I think I'd rather see that same amount of money spent on vastly improving local public transit projects around CA. Specifically, money should be spent to: - improve and expand CalTrain and BART service in the Bay Area. - develop bus rapid transit in the Bay Area, Sacto, LA and San Diego - improve and expand LA's commuter train service Local transit projects like these could probably take more cars off the road, and provide just as many construction jobs, as the high speed train.	5373079	Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Does California Need High-Speed Rail?

For those of us who favor high speed rail, it is time to acknowledge that there is no such thing as a perfect project and muster the will to proceed. While we bicker the years are passing, the planet is warming, the auto industry is flourishing, and rail transportation in America remains a joke. There is another adage which may be relevant to this debate: Sometimes perfect is the enemy of good.	5371440	Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Does California Need High-Speed Rail?

Carol	3	0	Governor Jerry Brown has made it clear in his State of the State message that he wants HSR. He ordered the new, more realistic study. legislators recently proposed merging CAHSR with Caltrans for better management; and starting at both ends rather than the central valley. This way they can improve existing infrastructure beginning this year with stimulus $$ already allocated. SF is already building the train station. LA needs trains. Much less effect of earthquakes the deeper you go underground. Peninsula cities need to stop the NIMBYism and plan for tunnels to mitigate the disruption of elevated Berms. replace dangerous-street-level-loud Caltrains with pedestrian/bicycle greenway over the tunnels. BART was impossibly expensive too, but the longer we waited the more the price grew. A new freeway is more expensive. $200/trip for 30 years doesn't sound so bad compared to all the jobs and development around train stations. We have to grow out of our difficulties is a worthy investment in public resources in my opinion.

AD	4	0	California's education system and existing infrastructure are collapsing because there's not enough revenue to sustain them, which is largely a legacy of Proposition 13 and other anti-tax measures, not high-speed rail. Also, in common with other people who say the HSR project should simply be scrapped, professor White names zero alternatives. How, I wonder, does he propose to deal with the huge population increases projected to take place in California in the coming decades? How does he plan to move those people between the cities? As another contributor has already shown, simply building more highways or more airports will cost just as much, if not more, than HSR, and they'll soon be congested as well. It's no secret that the project has been bungled, but when it comes to efficient use of energy and space and passenger convenience, nothing beats rail.	5374626	Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CET 2012	Does California Need High-Speed Rail?

Nicolas	11	0	"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San José is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

Greystone	2	0	As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one.	3590149	Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is It Harder to Be a Celebrity Now?

He is probably more popular now than before. Years ago, if behavior like that had become public, his fans would have shunned him, and his career would probably be over. My parents told me it took a long time for Elizabeth Taylor's fans to forgive her for being the other woman and stealing Eddie Fisher away from America's sweetheart, Debbie Reynolds. In Hollywood now, this is acceptable behavior. We've even come to expect it, as we have talk shows and books detailing all their affairs.	3587005	Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CET 2011	Is It Harder to Be a Celebrity Now?

B D Berry	4	0	See the dream as the journal of the soul. See prayer as the personality's half of the dialogue: the kind of prayer when we, sensing a decision that needs to be made, sort the possibilities and make the decision. Meaning it, building that habit. Then the prayer after the decision is made, is, how does my real self, the soul, see this situation? I had a teacher who taught me to dream this way, and I have, for years. And taught it, mostly to meditators. It is transformative. And yes, it leads to lucid dreams, which themselves are rich and helpful and further, make the soul real. And, I want to say of course, lead to lucid living, with a healthy flow of timely decisions, and the solace of a real dialogue with something timeless and universal but wholly inner.	2339888	Tue Aug 03 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Should We Manipulate Our Dreams?

anonymous in texas	2	0	I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too.	2340838	Tue Aug 03 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Should We Manipulate Our Dreams?

mjlisboa	2	0	Like Chet, I also learned to control my dreams when I was very young (about 5 years old). I used to have constant nightmares that would wake me up in the middle of the night. I remember trying very hard to wake up from them, one day it worked and from them on I was able to wake up whenever I wanted. I think that to make myself aware that I was having a nightmare was the first step to put an end to my nightmares, because only then I could then make myself wake up. Today, I can not only wake up when I want, but I can also manipulate my dreams (well, most of them at least) and, if one of my dreams is interrupted, I can sleep and go back to it.

I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life.

Lkf	9	0	Goofy beyond belief. Religious beliefs are just that...beliefs. To whatever degree a religious practice is benign, it should be allowed. When the practice impinges upon public health or safety, it must be curtailed for the benefit of the entire society. Our tradition is not to concern ourselves with how people worship their god (or choose not to worship at all.) All are free to practice their religion as they see fit. Accordingly, we should also be able to choose to be free of religion when it impinges upon public health or well being.

J&G	10	0	Knowledge and science should trump religion . Circumcision practices for boys and girls are primitive and backward rituals intended to establish a clear distinction between them and societies they don't recognize or despise. Circumcision for boys amongst the Jews and Muslims should be performed by physicians not rabbis or imams or whoever else performs them. I witnessed a circumcision, I find it barbaric and cruel to a baby. I am a Jew and will not circumcise any boy. The only time it is acceptable would be for health or hygiene. Circumcision for girls is intended to be punitive and damaging , It is an abomination. Religious freedom stops when it starts to affect and interfere with the greater good of society.

casual observer	3	0	As a society we believe that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness which means that parents may not deprive their children of these rights anymore than can the state. Legally, it's not so clear because our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion while our statutes and the common law set some limits upon how individuals can treat their children when the outcomes imperil their lives and welfare. As a result even if the parents opt out of health care insurance because they do not seek any health care, if they or their children need emergency care it will be provided unless they can legally refuse treatment -- meaning that the children will likely receive health care when the conditions are serious enough regardless of the parents wishes.	14382807	Wed Mar 11 00:00:00 CET 2015	Parents' Beliefs vs. Their Children's Health	Should parents' religious beliefs allow them to refuse medical care for their children or avoid standard medical practices?	/roomfordebate/2015/03/10/parents-beliefs-vs-their-childrens-health	Parents' religious beliefs should allow them to refuse medical care for their children	Parents' religious beliefs should not allow them to refuse medical care for their children	false	false	Parents' religious beliefs should not allow them to refuse medical care for their children

Diana	2	0	When I am confronted by religious practitioners passionately arguing for absolute religious freedom I have lately started to pose questions of them rather than argue. For example, how should we deal with a religious group that practices cannibalism? Among those societies that have practiced it, there has been a sacred and even reverential set of beliefs built around sharing in the admirable qualities of the person whose flesh is shared. Supposedly wine becomes blood and bread becomes flesh during Communion. I am met with incredulous stares when I mention this. It could never happen, I am told. When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them. These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them. We know intuitively what we as a society are willing to accept and harming children is not among them. What we do to ourselves as adults is one thing. Losing a child unnecessarily harms us all.	14388117	Thu Mar 12 00:00:00 CET 2015	Parents' Beliefs vs. Their Children's Health	Should parents' religious beliefs allow them to refuse medical care for their children or avoid standard medical practices?	/roomfordebate/2015/03/10/parents-beliefs-vs-their-childrens-health	Parents' religious beliefs should allow them to refuse medical care for their children	Parents' religious beliefs should not allow them to refuse medical care for their children	false	false	Parents' religious beliefs should not allow them to refuse medical care for their children

America is afraid to place restriction on the poor, mentally retarded, mentally ill, felons, or even youth to prevent them from having children or owning guns. To do so places a society at risk of sterilizing the innocent, or worse. I've watched so many members of my family seek religious solutions to medical issues because the medical answers aren't there. They become recluses in homeless shelters. They suffer and their children suffer. Society somehow imagines the answer is making them 'unborn' because real solutions are complex, expensive and require new technologies that aren't here yet. For me the question is, ""How do we help people who are suffering, so they make better choices?"" Good faith, means trusting others to behave altruistically; unless they don't. When they are hurting others the issue is no longer about their rights. Children are not the possession of a cult, community or individual.

Not only are Christian Scientists not forbidden from going to doctors, they are instructed to choose a quality physician if need be and confer with physicians if they have no idea what they are praying about. The dogma of ""no medicine ever"" is just that, and has done inestimable damage to their desire to promote spiritual healing. It's not surprising that most people think of Christian Science as empty or dangerous superstition given the anecdotal nature of most church testimonies of healing and the tragedies that have occurred when parents and others have refused medical attention in dire circumstances because they believed their teachings prevented them from going to doctors."	14385635	Thu Mar 12 00:00:00 CET 2015	Parents' Beliefs vs. Their Children's Health	Should parents' religious beliefs allow them to refuse medical care for their children or avoid standard medical practices?	/roomfordebate/2015/03/10/parents-beliefs-vs-their-childrens-health	Parents' religious beliefs should allow them to refuse medical care for their children	Parents' religious beliefs should not allow them to refuse medical care for their children	false	false	Parents' religious beliefs should not allow them to refuse medical care for their children

But this is just the kind of thinking -- with or without God -- expressed by parents of unvaccinated children, who put their entire neighborhood and beyond at risk because they _believe_ they are doing the right thing. There was just news, for example, that the measles outbreak has now spread into Canada tied to the first transmission in Disneyland. There should be no exemptions in the public sphere for parents who believe in magical thinking, no matter what their alleged divine source. And if we learn of a child at risk of serious injury or death because his/her parents _believe_ they are doing the right thing, I hope the state will step in like it would any other form of child abuse.

Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching.

I believe Russia's hidden motive in Syria, is to use the immigration crisis as a weapon to attack the west. Russia is using the west's own sense of compassion and valuation of human rights, as a weapon against us. By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere. I have long felt that Assad, and his father before him, were the only true impediment to peace in the middle east.

Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information.	8370267	Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CET 2013	Should Companies Tell Us When They Get Hacked?

Andrew Zuckerman	18	0	I'm an attorney and frequently appear in Family Court. The court has substituted audio recording for live reporters in most proceedings. The resultant recordings are then transcribed manually by someone listening to the audio record if transcript is ordered. The transcripts that are typed from the audio recording of the proceeding are invariably terrible. Parts of the transcript are virtually always missed and marked as 'inaudible.' Other parts are garbled. The transcripts are frequently worse than nothing at all. There is no real substitute for a transcript produced by a competent reporter and not having a reporter may sacrifice justice for the sake of saving a few dollars.	11520908	Tue Apr 08 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Are Court Stenographers Necessary?

Steven	3	0	With all due respect, Judge Kopf, digital recording technology cannot capture when somebody is not speaking loud enough, clear enough, or speaks with a thick accent. A court reporter is able to interrupt and clarify for an accurate record. And there is no technology that can replace a real time reporter, who can provide an instantaneous translation, which results in immediate resolution of an issue that might otherwise delay a proceeding and enables judges to speed up their dockets, and lawyers to move on to their next case, which will speed up the judicial system as a whole, therefore saving money, if that indeed is your ultimate goal.	11523833	Tue Apr 08 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Are Court Stenographers Necessary?

Mike	1	0	I fully agree with everything you've said and would like to add one further point which comes to mind after having recently observed a proceeding in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan. There was a court reporter at work on that case along with an audio system for the benefit of those in the courtroom. Their juxtaposition had me thinking about the need for both several times throughout the day, and I concluded that the audio system would do just fine on its own -- so long as the participants are reminded to speak clearly enough for recording. There were times when I was pretty sure that the judge was relying on the court reporter's good sense of hearing to make a complete transcript and may not herself have heard everything that was said. So, even if court reporters are someday replaced by recording devises, they may still be needed to act as recoding engineers of sorts to ensure a faithful transcription.	11521689	Tue Apr 08 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Are Court Stenographers Necessary?

There are not many of us who have the concentration level to type precisely what people say for hours and hours at a time.

The Professor	7	0	Is it any surprise that a right wing writer who I'm sure would have preferred to see Hoover continue as president has come out with another book that twists and ignores facts. Considering the Dust Bowl, the ability of American farmers to produce sufficient food was impossible. When that finally ended the land was so completely stripped of top soil that it took years to get it back to full production. It is amazing that people like Folsom are still looking back 80 years to try and find a way to blame FDR for everything that has happened since. If the solution was so easy and obvious why didn't the host of GOP presidents just fix it. Instead they found ways to drive the small farmers off the land and make room for the industrial farms owned by their rich supporters. My mother's family had small farms that couldn't compete with the giants and were all driven off their land that the family had farmed since the late 1800s. I wonder how much Folsom is paid to write books that will mostly be bought by the case by the rich supporters of his twisted, imagined viewpoint.	2879489	Tue Nov 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

Anthony Broadwell	14	0	"Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--""get big or get out""--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture."	2879291	Tue Nov 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

As much preserving the American domestic food market, it has to be balanced properly in response to the Federal deficit, in order to properly protect and fund America's farms.	2908002	Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

Will	4	0	For some reason farmers (and fisherman) view making a profit as a right. Why should the rest of us support them? Farms are no more required for national security than are supermarkets or restaurants. If those businesses can survive in a free market, so can farms. In a time when unemployment is so high and our infrastructure is crumbling, giving money to farmers is disgraceful. The fact that most subsidies actually go to large agro-business and wealthy farmers is even more galling.	2879338	Tue Nov 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

W.A. Spitzer	7	0	Let me begin by saying that I grew up in farm country (cash grain - corn/soybeans) and I own farm land and annually receive farm subsidy payments. I would make a few points. First, most of the people who expound about farmers and farming have no idea what they are talking about. Second, I have heard about giant farms who receive huge subsidies all my life, so I presume it must be true, but it simply doesn't exist in the corn/soybean area I am familiar with. Third, there have been dramatic boom/bust cycles in crop prices the past few years, but this has been driven by speculators in the commodities markets, and currency manipulation (China). Fourth, farm products such as corn and soybeans are one of the few items that this country still exports in large amounts, so you had better be careful what you do. Finally, having said that, there has not been a recession in farm country - the farmers are doing quite nicely, and there is no reason that crop payments for corn and soybeans should continue.	2878785	Mon Nov 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

Fred	4	0	Very one sided discussion: 1. All subsidies go to rich people because there purpose is to draw investment capital into those parts of the market. They have to go to people who have captial. 2. Decreases in farm subsidies will decrease farm production and increase food prices for everyone. 3. Increased farm prices will decrease exports and causing further decreases in production and increase in prices 4. Potential food shortages is a national security issue.	2877407	Mon Nov 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

ekeizer4	9	0	"Why exactly should the government be responsible for ""creat[ing] genuine opportunity for millions of rural people""? People who live in rural areas are entitled to the same welfare and food stamp benefits as people in cities. There are certainly areas of deep poverty in rural areas, but why single these areas out for special treatment? Furthermore, I wonder if ""genuine opportunity"" will ever exist in many sparsely populated areas. What sorts of opportunity would you recommend? Cities exist for a reason; they allow people to gather so that commerce can occur. Unless everyone in rural America intends to rely solely on farming, I fail to see much possibility for economic opportunities. The government should not subsidize a system that is fundamentally unworkable and that will always be dependent on such subsidies for survival."	2876624	Mon Nov 22 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

Kris	2	0	As the son of a farmer, I reluctantly agree with the author's conclusion. Farm subsidies grossly reward a small-percentage of large-scale corporate farms and businesses, which now operate on scales in vast disproportion to the revered Jeffersonian single-farmer business. Farm subsidies indirectly support major pharmaceutical companies through chemicals, oil industries (fertilizer), and diesel production/ports; a very nationalist enterprise in an era of which America is the self-proclaimed champion of global free markets and force tariff removals. There are only two kinds of farmers: those selling their land and millionaires...there is little in-between in this industry...which also can no longer survive in a free market...commcercial farming has, in the words of a famous person, become 'too big too be allowed to fail.'	2908114	Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

SPB	2	0	The farm subsidies actually hurt the type of farm that has traditionally been the backbone of America. I refer to the small to medium size family farm. Smaller farms can detail their crops and rotations to better conserve soil and water. They support a traditional farmer life style. Small farms support small towns, local banks, grocery stores, schools, equipment dealers and a wide farmer's work ethic. Larger farms destroy all of this. If we support farms in order to help America, let's support small farms that actually help it.	2880029	Tue Nov 23 00:00:00 CET 2010	Do Farm Subsidies Protect National Security?

woodyrd	10	0	The subsidy programs need to be reformed, not eliminated. Tighter income/subsidy caps are needed. Programs that encourage innovation instead of requiring farmers to maintain subsidized acreages and surplus production. If we use black-and-white thinking and eliminate the entire program, the largest corporate farms will benefit. The smaller farms cannot compete against the cost efficiencies that come with scale. The health of our farms is important. Our farmers are stewards of our agricultural soils, arguably our most valuable natural resource. Let's not play politics with our land.

Raymond	12	0	As an American Latino I do not at all like the separation between ' us ' and everyone else. We are one nation. Why are we so quick to say Latino families should be afforded higher education? How, in this age of political correctness, is that okay? Are we going to run around wearing Brown Pride shirts next? If white folk decided to have ' white only ' forums or ' white only ' college programs that would be labeled racist and exclusionary. We Latinos separate ourselves ENOUGH by insisting on very little to zero assimilation in our communities and on being Latin in everything we say, do, read and watch. We even teach our children to shun away from saying they are Americans like its a bad thing. College is NOT a right. As such, we shouldn't to get a free ride just because we happen to speak Spanish at home. It's an archaic way of thinking and not what the American Dream is supposed to be.

Sharon	2	0	"Herein lies the rub ...""Many require remedial courses to catch up to college-level work."" What are we doing wrong in K-12 to prepare students for the rigors of college? Heck, my daughter has well above a 4.0 and has scored high on PSAT, etc and I still worry about the rigors of college. We need to set up all students for success. If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine. I feel differently about it when taxpayers are funding it."	17285062	Thu Jan 21 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

David Illig	7	0	I'm neither a dogmatic liberal nor a pandering politician (I'm an unabashed leftist). Education is the most important investment the people can make with their tax dollars. It's a legitimate, working get-rich-quick scheme. Look at the post-WWII GI Bill as a model. Education in public institutions of higher learning should be absolutely free of cost for qualified students. The taxpayers who pay for it will be among the first to benefit.	17286558	Thu Jan 21 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

David Thomas	4	0	*There are many college graduates working at low-paying jobs for which their education is unrelated, and can't pay off their student loans. If a university contends that the content of what it teaches will enhance the earning power of the graduate sufficiently to pay off that cost, then let that university self-finance the student debt. Otherwise, accept that what is being taught has a cost that is not commensurate to improved ability to pay it.

Donald Green	7	0	There were a few times in our history when tuition was waved. After WWII there was the GI Bill. Another was the Russian successful launch of the Sputnik. Both opened university doors to millions of students. I was one of them. With that assistance I made my way into medicine. Others became engineers or researchers. What I know is the nation got a boost of talent, and brought progress to the nation. Mr. Petrilli describes the effect of poverty, and negates the possibility of many to advance themselves and this country. Education even if paid by tax payers does not address every short fall in society, but it does help many. It is time to reject fatalist opinion, and redirect our attention to doing what should be done to improve everyone's survival.	17282006	Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

casual observer	1	0	Indeed, one cannot actually buy a college education like one can buy a house or a private airplane but the basic presumption of Kelly is that it is exactly the same. Anyone can who pays the money will have the knowledge and skills injected into their minds, and thus benefit. So why should some be handed it while others pay for it? One must perform considerable work over a prolonged period of time and not everyone has the ability to do it in a reasonable time nor to be able to use it well. But the reason society creates and maintains colleges and universities is that they enable all to benefit from the knowledge and skills those able and willing to gain them do for themselves and everybody else. It's worth making it affordable to all who can manage to do the work because it greatly improves that kind of potential that our workforce can provide and be prepared for all opportunities that might arise.	17374751	Sat Jan 30 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

There still should be a level of responsibility by the student. I personally know a museum curator/archaeologist that works as a bank teller. This person will never be able to pay the college loan at the current level of employment and the chosen field of this person is quite dismal. Who is responsible for this person's choice? Me? Tax payers? I personally don't think it should be my responsibility as a tax payer to cover the cost of this education choice. Making a blanket statement that education should be free is irresponsible. Free is not free. Someone always pays.	17359492	Wed Jan 27 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

Ronald Williams	1	0	What I believe is that public college should be tuition free to the students, that is, it should be paid for with tax dollars. Today the only people who start their careers with $25k to $100k non-dischargeable debt are children of the middle and low income class. Children of the wealthy start out debt free. In addition, we charge these students 6% to 8% interest!!! Sometimes they have children entering college on credit before they get their student loans paid off. Ridiculous. The least we could do is make the debt interest free. The right thing to do is to finance college with tax dollars, not with crippling student debt.	17341485	Tue Jan 26 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

Ann	9	0	I would enthusiastically support free 4 year college for everyone with a 3.0 High School GPA and scores of 1900 on the SAT or 28 on the ACT and free 2 year community college for everyone with a 2.5 GPA and scores of 1590 on the SAT or 23 on the ACT. If someone attends community college and achieves a 3.0 GPA there, they should be able to transfer to a 4 year college and have the remainder of that paid for them. If a kid can't achieve the levels for free tuition at a university or community college, they can still pay to attend. Maybe they'll prove everyone wrong. It's vitally important to the country that all our smart and studious kids who want it, can choose higher education, no matter their means. Whatever we would spend on tuition for the 3.0 GPA students, we would gain back many times over. There will be increased productivity, increased tax revenues, better general health, less crime, inventions, cures, who knows what we'll get? History tells us that it will be a big win-win. It's a worthwhile investment.	17297586	Fri Jan 22 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

Nancy	5	0	Higher education is an investment in human resources for the future progress and well-being of the nation and its citizens. Public funding of tuition costs, the pre-Reagan practice in California, is as valid as public funding for other investments in capital and human resources for the nation: roads, bridges, defense capability, regulation of corporations, medical research, health care for all, community fire and policing capability, protection of the environment, etc....

Anne Russell	2	0	My great-uncle, Charles Woollen, was Comptroller of the University of North Carolina in the early 1900s. UNC was America's first public university, with free tuition for all NC residents, because NC wished to have an educated populace. Unfortunately, females and blacks were not admitted to UNC as were white males, though this has changed. And also unfortunately, UNC no longer offers free tuition, and tuition/fees have risen while admission has become much more difficult. I am a UNC graduate who also has been UNC faculty, and my father and daughters have been UNC graduates. Perhaps if UNC ceased paying top administrators and coaches outrageous salaries and perks, students could again earn degrees without having large debts to pay.	17285221	Thu Jan 21 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

That tuition cap limits college spending to whatever the public is willing to invest. But it does not change the cost of college, or what institutions actually spend per student."" Yes it does... you can't spend more than you have, just a simple fact. Public education would likely be cheaper on a per student basis than the private version. Classes would be larger, dorms less nice, with less landscaping on the lawns. I don't think that's necessarily bad. I think the current system is actually the worst of all worlds - a loan and financial aid system that effectively allows colleges to charge each student the absolute maximum of what they're able to pay, with public subsidies helping increase the price further."	17284633	Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

Mark Weber	1	0	'Free' does not project value. Offering free state university tuition sounds great. Does it solve society problems? Not necessarily! I have seen many students with full federal tuition support due poorly. The distractions and challenges, outside the classroom, still distract them. Plus it is not their money. They did not have to earn or borrow it. There is a tendency for them to withdraw from a class. Free public education impacts the ability of non-profit private colleges to exist. What happens when these institutions crumble? Do state schools have the capacity to pick-up non-profit private school students? Can we afford 'free' across all college students? 'Free' excites us.

Dr. Goodword	1	0	Community colleges tend to have standards much lower than 'regular' colleges and universities. They should be free, but we should lower our expectations to the level of the tuition. We cannot make regular colleges and universities free because of their very expensive athletic programs. US colleges and universities provide 'farm' teams for the big football and basketball leagues by adding the cost of these activities to the tuition of students who do no participate in sports. I do not have an figures for this, but if US colleges and universities provided ONLY education, far more graduates would graduate debt-free.	17283840	Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

James Ward	1	0	A college education used to be a great equalizer in our society. Now it has become a differentiator. States have consistently withdrawn funding while costs have increased. I have a friend who came from a working class background as I did. We both obtained Masters Degrees from good schools. He became a vice president with Citicorp and I am a successful consultant. Luckily, we attended school in the 1960s-'70s and it was quite affordable. Now both of us would have been relegated to working class jobs or accumulated so much debt (as so much pressure) that we could never dig ourselves out of that hole. The rich and powerful have us where they want us, and they've bought the politicians who keep their boots on our necks. Yes, higher education should be at least affordable to all and actively encouraged. We need an educated populace to compete in the world economy, obtain good jobs and ensure a functioning democracy. Just look at the politicians who are being supported by those with less than a college, or high school, education and you'll see demonstration of the kind of democracy we'll wind up with.	17283033	Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

jay65	1	0	What another liberal fad. Tuition is too high for many reasons, chiefly because colleges and universities for the most part compete to be all things to all people, so faculty and classroom space must constantly expand. Also, only the wealthy pay the 'rack rate' full tuition at the top institutions with decent endowments or state funding. Free tuition would increase two things: more marginally or unqualified applicants and proliferation of easy, feel good, study yourself courses and majors. The idea of substituting community service for standardized test scores and grades as a basis for admission will further dilute the seriousness of university scholarship. I would offer free tuition if at all to majors in English, foreign languages, science, math, music, engineering -- not social science, cultural 'studies', film, and pre-professional majors such as business, accounting, marketing and so forth (nufsuch).	17282881	Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

bip425	1	0	It seems obvious to us that free, basic health care and education are the two social services that should be available to everybody. Free education is, from an macro economical stand point, a much better investment than the US model because it increases the productivity of the population at large. Free health care lowers the general cost to the GDP from 16% to 7%, the average in Europe. If this was applied, the US would free up 9% of its GDP or $1.5 trillion, each year, for disposal income.	17282699	Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

PetroWriter	1	0	Coming from Canada, where tuition is subsidized to a greater extent than in the US, I can see the advantage to free education, but have also seen the disadvantages. It opens up opportunities for people that wouldn't be able to go otherwise, and gives a boost to the economy from new graduates not being saddled with huge student loans. Unfortunately, it also leads to people attending, who might not be ready and are doing it because it is free. And ties a schools hands if costs escalate more than government funding. A better way may be to reduce, but not eliminate tuition with have students loans that are partially forgiven upon successful completion of the program, and the remainder of the student loans be set at a manageable interest rate.	17282355	Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 CET 2016	Should College Be Free?

Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps.

In the NBA, one guy brings the ball up, everybody stands around for 15 of the allotted 24 seconds, then one guy (I'm looking at you, LeBron, or Kobe, or, especially you, Carmelo) either misses a 3-pointer or ""takes it to the rack"" for a dunk and/or a foul. At the college level, this year's ""March Madness"" was, until the final game, March Dullness. Too few players know how to play as a team, or even how to shoot. Scoring is down, even (especially) compared to the days before the shot clock. I dunno. Maybe they should LOWER the rim."	9051107	Wed May 22 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Raise the Rim?

Mike	3	0	"""It would be similar to pushing back the outfield fence in baseball, and nobody wants to see fewer home runs."" Right on one count, wrong on the other. Hey, I know, let's lower the rim so everyone can dunk. Then it'll be even better, right? The assumption that fans are too stupid to appreciate nuance is why modern basketball is a dunking contest, modern baseball is a home run derby, and I've lost my patience with both.

ktcass0	1	0	Keep the basket where it is but make a 1 point shot line close to the basket. A dunk requires no skill, it just requires the right genes.

Matt	14	0	The comments here are so odd ... not many fans of the game here. Dunks are difficult to achieve, especially with the defenses that are now common in the NBA. What LeBron does isn't 'easy' by any means. The standards of the game have risen since the 'good old days', and the dunk is one weapon (and not the primary weapon) in the overall arsenal of the NBA offense. Much of the lamenting here strikes me as bitter old people yearning for the past. The NBA is better today than it was 40 years ago.	9047310	Tue May 21 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Raise the Rim?

ROC	2	0	"The game I grew up with and today's game are very different. In 1957 there were 8 teams, 11 players on each team, a total of 88 players in the entire league. Basketball was more a team game then, Bill Russell started his unbelievable streak, 13 seasons, 12 trips to the finals, 11 championships. Dribbling was done with the palm down, if Michael Jordan were magically transported back to 1957, he would have been called for palming the first time he touched the ball. The reason players today are able to drive so quickly is guiding the ball with the palm up, pushing the ball forward. Watching the Knicks of Reed and Frazier was a concert of 5 men working together,, moving the ball to the open man, constantly moving. Today 4 guys stand and watch an Anthony or James drive past their defender in an isolation play. Returning to the point, watching a 6'3"" guard dunk cheapens the shot, raise the basket 1 foot and the shot will regain the importance when Wilt Chamberlain the down a monster dunk."	9044212	Tue May 21 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Raise the Rim?

dballantyne	3	0	Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball).	9043990	Tue May 21 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Raise the Rim?

John	1	0	There's little question that the 'dunk' has diminished the attraction of the NBA game.

Back to Basics Rob	1	0	Having loved the skill, energy and movement in the pro game since seeing Wilt in an exhibition at the Garden in 1959 (when I was seven), why not first try these easier remedies to make each player more accountable: move the three point line back; stop the carrying while dribbling; get rid of the zone; and start calling giving two shots and the ball for deliberately hard fouls and not just excessively hard fouls; except in the fourth quarter, when all fouls become shooting fouls. The game in the 1960's and 1970's was a better quality game than the junk basketball that now prevails during the regular season. Oh yes: make a winning record on the road during the regular season much more significant.	9051776	Wed May 22 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Raise the Rim?

Christopher Walker	2	0	The rim is fine where it is, but dunking should not be allowed-- technically it is cheating. The ball is not supposed to be touched while in the cylinder as that is offensive goaltending. Remove the dunk exception for offensive goaltending from the rules and you will have a more challenging game, even if you lose some highlight reel plays. Of course I say this as an old guy who can no longer dunk.	9048032	Tue May 21 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Raise the Rim?

Dave	2	0	The game of basketball has already made a slew of changes to adapt to the men who now play the game (not so much women, though they used to play a totally different game than they do today). My dad played in the 1930s and they had a jump ball after every basket. That would be boring today and would unduly favor a team that had a giant for center. The 10 foot rim may never change, even when men are so tall that they have to bend over to dunk. But it should change.	9046377	Tue May 21 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Raise the Rim?

dm	5	0	The writers do not get at the heart of the problem but the commenters do. The writers are interested in peripheral issues that are important to them. Gender bias may seem central, for example, but it isn't here: it's perhaps more important than this issue, but it's not the same as this issue. The problem the commenters see, rightly, is that students aren't qualified to evaluate teachers, and are biased by their narrow, anti-intellectual concerns.	17008856	Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

B.A.	19	0	RateMyTeacher.com, a corollary to RateMyProfessor.com, brings out the crazies and the malcontents. Over the past 12-15 years, the comments posted about me are often by disturbed students. Three times I've had to write the site to dispute a student's comments: One who said I knew nothing (I'd written a book on the subject), one who wrote because he was disgruntled about the way I tried to differentiate tests (mandated by the school), and another who commented that I was depressed (far from the truth) -- whom I doubt was even my student! I think the site is dangerous and invites trolling by students with severe misconceptions, those unhappy about grades, and those with gripes that would be better expressed in a face to face discussion. These posted comments affect a teacher's reputation and ability to find another job. I dread looking at the site to see what's there -- but on the other hand, I do look to see if there are comments that need to be removed because they are vicious or false.	16969415	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

Vanadias	34	0	This reads like parody. Rate My Professors is an organized venue...with a chili pepper icon to evaluate professors' hotness, a techno-bureaucratic set of sliding scales to place people on a scale of 1-5, and rarely a serious or self-reflective comment about content, pace, or intellectual challenge. Ge real. It's a place to vent. And that venting can go either direction, too: students will sing the praise of one teacher, and assail another. Their are very few middle reviews. And why is that? Because the forum is self-selecting, and--through its rationalist design--it encourages yes or no evaluation. Is that what we want? Students who are encouraged to judge everything as either black or white?	16967238	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

Emrys Westacott	32	0	The main problem with Rate My Professor as a reliable guide to the quality of the instructor is statistical: the proportion of students who post anything is tiny; and they are not necessarily representative. Those who post ratings are more likely to be those with strong views. They may even have a specific purpose in posting, such as boosting or trashing the instructor. Yet given the total number of students most professors teach (about 1000 over ten years), the responses of a few dozen are a poor guide to anything.	16966594	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

independent	6	0	"""Just as there are good and bad refrigerators, there are good and bad professors."" Really? Anonymous on-line evaluations have been shown to be spurious. This is supported by published research and personal experience. Student evaluations of courses are strongly correlated to grade. Glaringly obvious when most variables are removed; e.g., comparing physics course sections covering identical material, taught by the same professor, in the same semester, and with the same assessment measures. NB, physics has the advantage that grades are based on scores, not potentially subjective measures, hence it was not the case that students' grades were influenced by the instructor's impression of them. More accurate measures are evaluations by trained, paid, identified peers and students.

And the students who love your class often send a personal note rather than those motivated by a bad grade or a personal dislike to go online and punish you.

Jack	20	0	Students are not in a position to rate professors. Students are in the classroom to learn. I can't see how any professor who has a Ph.D. and knows his subject area cannot be a help to students whose work it is to learn. Yes, some profs are inspired teachers, great entertainers, dynamic lecturers. But some are boring, unimaginative, plodding. That's the way things are in the university and in life. A twenty-year-old who has a whole lot to learn about life should not be able to negatively affect the career of a prof. because he doesn't like that prof or the way he/she runs a class. Try giving out lots of Cs and see how you rate ( a grade, by the way that most students based on my experience deserve). If, as it happens, a particular prof is a terrible teacher, and a few are, word of mouth will determine the degree of success in his/her career. But the university should not invite criticism of its teachers by people who have only just learned to do their own laundry and fry an egg for themselves. Let the students work hard to learn what is being offered them.	16969915	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

ManhattanWilliam	21	0	I think the concept of rating professors online (like just about any other form of public ratings) is ludicrous. To think that students attending a college where they are to be judged by a professor and given a grade for a class should be taken as fair and impartial in rating that professor's performance makes ZERO sense. Even worse, of course, are people who go out to eat and suddenly find themselves qualified to write for Gourmet Magazine. I read these reviews occasionally but NEVER take them seriously. Still, complaining will do nothing to stop this from occurring. Such are the times we live in and nothing is going to turn back the clock HOWEVER I, for one, think the concept is pretty repulsive and anyone or any institution that takes these ratings seriously is, by my definition, a person not to be taken seriously.	16969541	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

Bob H	23	0	Rate my Professor is essentially an internet scam to generate site traffic. I am sorry to see it getting this kind of free publicity in a serious paper like the NYT. Rate my Professor is a for-profit site. You can even post a review of someone without ever having taken a class with that person or on a class that the professor never taught. Try it. Most universities have systems for the evaluation of faculty. (I would be surprised if any do not.) They ensure that only students who actually took the class participate in the evaluation process.	16969471	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

Rebecca L	6	0	A lot of these comments criticize the use of RMP because students who don't like to do work and want to be entertained tend to like the easier professors. This is too shallow a view of RMP. RMP has extremely valuable information because people actually type in information. When you read over and over that the teacher fails to adequately explain material so that everyone is confused at test time, that's important information for a student. When you read again and again that the teacher doesn't like taking questions and instead prefers to stick to her outline, that's important information. When you read numerous reviews saying the students came away from the class with a new love of the material, that's important information. It's also really easy to see which professors are well-liked for being easy--which is also important information for a student who either needs a filler class to round out an otherwise brutal semester, or needs stronger instruction in that subject, in which case he can avoid the easy teacher. It's not about who has five stars versus one, there's much more to it than that.	16968661	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

chuck	6	0	I've taught college for 30 years. I often (admittedly with some sarcasm) tell my teaching assistants that students who do well take credit for it, and students who do badly blame the instructor. That is not true across the board, but there is some element of truth in it. As for Rate My Professor, I am in favor of it, even with its many flaws (pointed out by other contributors to this debate). Like so many things in modern life (including elections), we have to go with the best of the flawed possibilities. Yes, some of the criteria are irrelevant and even ridiculous (the hot peppers). But if a consensus of ratings in criteria that actually matter are good, then a student is probably wise to take that class. If the consensus is bad, then take a different one. (By the way, I never check my ratings. I am way too busy! But I read the written evaluations my students submit very carefully. They are probably a better representation of the whole class.)	16968143	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

Cflapjack	3	0	Back in the day I recall getting my midterm and paper back while taking the final. The prof did not give me my paper during the exam because I had done poorly and he did not want me to lose my concentration. Nice guy. When I finally got the paper from him and he told me how bad it was I had to hold my tongue because he could still have failed me. Of course if I had known I was doing poorly in the class I would have gone to his office and asked him how I could improve. Ask what I was doing wrong. He had done nothing wrong and it was common for profs to do the minimum of work. I am so glad there is a forum now where people can be called out on their sloppy efforts.	16967643	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

ACEkin	6	0	"I write as professor emeritus from a well-known institute of higher education. For over 4 decades I taught marketing research which is inherently involved in measurement. I know from teaching this subject and conducting research, measurement is a very complex and unforgiving process and is as good ad the instrument and its administration. As much as I believe that good measurement of performance is very valuable to faculty members, I also believe that much of this measurement is done carelessly and unscientifically. Consequently, you are more likely to see extreme results and some that do not make the intended sense at all. One of the best compliments I received from a student was in the form of what he or she must have thought to be highly critical, and I quote: ""The worst teacher I have ever had. He did not teach me anything, I had to read the book myself.""

John	1	0	Student feedback, in my opinion is a good thing as long as there is mechanism to lift the veil of anonymity when libel is claimed. In some cases, students may seek the easiest path to a degree, while the university strive to maintain a reputation. One area reviews likely address is large differences in difficulty and approaches to the same class. I it as an injustice if two professors teaching the same material give very different grade for the students of similar competence and discipline. This is contrary to the AP system when many thousands of students take the same exam. Ratings may help eliminate this by create an obvious difference in demand when creating schedules.	16967564	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

Vanadias	37	0	I urge Mr. Stankiewicz to do his due diligence--required by any good journalism major--and perform some research. Two major studies in the last decade have shown that student evaluations are wholly flawed ways of evaluating learning. In fact, there is some evidence for a negative correlation between student reviews and learning. In other words, the more students dislike a professor, the better those students do in similar classes down the road. Why? Because those professors challenge students to push past their comfort zones and rigid patterns of thinking. Oh, and if you're going to use that erroneous consumer metaphor, then at least get it right: professors are not the product--the student mind is the product, and preparing it for engagement in civil society is the endpoint.	16967133	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

rbirds	5	0	This entire conversation gives me heartburn. I am a college teacher who, yes, has entries on Rate My Professor and who works for a college that overtly cites the website when lauding the success of its best teachers. So I pay attention to the public discussions of student evaluations. The heartburn comes not from fear that my rating index is too low but rather in the assumptions of both sides. The potential for abuse of these ratings is not based on students unqualified to evaluate their teachers (false, anyone can distinguish a poor product from a quality one) but rather on the methodology of Rate My Professor and other similar sites. As mentioned by at least one commenter, ratings suffer from selection bias and from a failure to use common terms. Those with strong opinions for or against are more likely to evaluate an instructor and what raters see as strict or smart or easy or dumb is so subjective that any two raters may have opposite definitions of the same word used in a rating. Not a good combination: an unrepresentative sample using uncommon terms to rate a product.	16966922	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

Zejee	5	0	I teach college students. I am rated. I don't mind at all. In fact, when I was going to grad school, I checked the ratings, and even added my own rating of especially good profs. Students actually do know who is a good teacher and who is not. It's not always who gives the easy A. Those teachers are often dismissed just as easily. The teachers who are valued are still -- even now -- the ones who actually teach and stretch the minds and abilities of students. These will alway be considered the best teachers. Always. Students are not as clueless as you may think.	16966773	Wed Dec 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Is It Fair to Rate Professors Online?

AG	33	0	We cannot depend on private industry to instantly know the best way to intervene in a disaster. There are problems that normal businesses simply don't prepare for - being cut off from supplies, having to work with only the employees that are able to show up, keeping track of things with no computers. This is what FEMA is FOR. They plan for this. They rehearse. They have experience with prior situations, and learn from each one what worked and what didn't. Why should communities re-invent the wheel? FEMA knows how to tap the local resources and guide them in how best to help. There HAS to be a centralized command structure so you don't end up with 25 truckloads of drinking water and no food. Do they always get everything right? Of course not. But I'll take my chances with an experienced crew over even the best intentions of someone trying to figure things out as they go.	7528299	Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Really Need FEMA?

Judyw	1	0	FEMA's job seems to be mostly supplying money. We don't need a large organization to hand out money. Local officials, at least in my area, handle ALL of the disaster need - shelters, snow plows, tree cutting etc. And neighbords help one another. But then I suspect we are a more homogeneous community than say Gaithersburg, MD. Homogeneous communities and local officials are better at self-help than multi-cultural ones where you may not even speka the language of your neighbor or even know who they are. Generally I think local communities do a better job than FEMA which is more like bull in a china shop But we don't need such a huge agencies with so many federal employees to hand out money - it could be cut in size and still work well.	7528221	Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CET 2012	Do We Really Need FEMA?

R A Pinkus	7	0	The student loan system is a crime. Why banks can default and get bailed out, and young people who are conned into signing big education loans are locked in with no recourse, says a lot about our current society. Most universities have very large endowment funds, many of which are used like a predatory financial instrument to make more money in contemporary Wall St. casino capitalism. Add in the $10s, possibly $100s of billions misplaced during the Iraq War, not to mention the expenditure we know about and it's really mind boggling. How did it come to this? We won't find out because every agency capable of looking into it is compromised by money and ideology.	5654207	Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should College Be for Everyone?

Sara	1	0	"When I observe that admission standards and courses in ""college"" leading to a BA have slipped to a level sometimes lower than a good suburban high school in the 1960's I shudder. 1. Our K12 education could contain a much higher level core curriculum and fostering of critical thinking and self learning BEFORE high school graduation. Of course, the students would have to be willing to actually perform and not all would get into the upper 10% of the graduating class, but the general level of graduates would return to something substantial. 2. Post secondary training and ""college"" need not be the same thing. In Europe there are post secondary opportunities to learn trades, many business skills, even things like working in the travel industry(think hotel management, package travel planning). 3. Diluting something like the standards of a university system to allow for more and more ""remedial cases"" is not doing anyone a favor. Offer post high school training at a multitude of levels. 4. Expect more from industry than just ""we want workers ready to start tomorrow"" - bring back the training programs and apprenticeship programs that build good and loyal workforces."	5696581	Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should College Be for Everyone?

Charley horse	7	0	Blue collar jobs: My plumber and electrician are both smart guys and seem to do well financially. My hairdresser has somehow amassed enough money to buy and sell large pieces of real estate. I know a young man who makes plenty in his window-washing business, and another friend, who works on computers with a technical-school education, has a house bigger than mine (I have a PhD). A couple of decades ago, we had an addition built on our house, and we used a highly recommended contractor. He told us that, when he graduated from high school, he took the money his father had saved for his college and started a business instead. He is still in business, probably has not had time for college. He has been successful and does good work. I would never minimize the importance of college for those who have a reason to go, but I can't agree with the one-size-fits-all philosophy. There are plenty of important jobs to be done that don't involve college; there are other kinds of skill and knowledge we all depend on.	5649121	Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CET 2012	Should College Be for Everyone?

casual observer	1	0	Weather forecasting is based upon analyzing well understood physical phenomena described by physics and chemistry and from better and better analyses of a vast amount of empirical evidence using advanced computer systems, and over the last half century has achieved a reliability of forecasting up to about a week ahead. Climate studies are used to predict long term trends without any expectation of precision as we expect of weather forecasting. When one looks at economics one does not have the grasp of the fundamental phenomena as I weather and thus the data cannot offer as must reliability in explaining what is going on or what can be expected as does weather forecasting, yet, people often try to rely upon economic forecasts going out decades into the future when most economic forecasts are rarely accurate further than a few weeks and sometimes even wrong about current activities based upon estimations in lieu of compiled data.	14085948	Mon Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Economists Overrated?

Demand start to slip, investment opportunities in the real economy dry up and the next thing you know you have Apple sitting on a mountain of cash because they have run out of consumers who can afford their products and they can make more money out of financial speculation than trying to create profitable products that are cheap enough for an impoverished proletariat.

fergus ferrier	1	0	After working in finance for long enough, I went back to school in an Economics Graduate program. Absolutely fascinated by the intricate mathematical modeling and discussions about the sign of the second derivative of some elaborate equation, indicating an unseen truth about the complexity of the world. Soon enough I realized that the discussion participants could not care less about that grand topic -- it was strictly an appeal to math wizardry. Amusing, but essentially worthless theory.	14084917	Mon Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Economists Overrated?

Richard Navas	1	0	The way Economics creates wealth is a lot like the weather forecaster creates wealth. First, notice that both professions use the term 'Forecast'. Second, both can be rather unreliable, however, on average the predictions are better than random chance. For example, knowing when when to plant crops and when NOT to plant makes agriculture vastly more effective. If you plant before the river floods or before the last hard frost you're in big trouble. Ancient peoples spent a good bit of money trying to get that right. It was money well spent, even though it wasn't particularly accurate. It was good enough.	14085350	Mon Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Economists Overrated?

Sam I Am	7	0	The problem is that economic expertise is primarily used by politicians in only convenient, self-serving ways. As someone who majored in economics as an undergraduate at a top liberal arts college, I have found that I can easily discern principled use of economic science from self-serving use. I can also say that over the last 20 years, the impact of macro-economic policy, both fiscal and monetary, has NEVER surprised me. It's also clear to me that many things in this world are primarily driven by things outside the realm of economics. It saddens me that so many professional economists are willing to rent out their professional reputation so cheaply, and to debase the profession so casually. I can't blame the public for dismissing economists generally, but I can lament that the ability to make the world a better place is so casually and needlessly wasted by political opportunists.	14082552	Mon Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Economists Overrated?

David N.	3	0	Next week the Times could sponsor a debate as to whether journalism is over-rated. And then we could debate whether law is based on pseudoscience. And maybe next a debate on democracy could provide a forum for yet another group made invidious by Nobel Prizes and statistical models providing a rational way forward. Commenters have hit new lows in identifying assumptions (straw horses) not made by their enemies, in somehow tying economic theory to tax-cuts-for-rich Republicans who don't know the first thing about markets, and in claiming that economists don't study institutions (never mind decades of thoughtful research on every institution connected to economics, from the family, to neighborhoods, to churches an non-profits, to labor unions, to institutions of government (isn't the Fed an institution?). And economists don't study complex patterns among hosts of variables? - give me a break. Perhaps the authors of this particular article should consider all the commenters' barbs that apply equally to sociology and any other social science. The Republican know-nothings have been joined by the anti-science pundits and commenters herein.	14087275	Tue Feb 10 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Economists Overrated?

Jeff	9	0	How can anyone lump all economists together? Of course economics is not a science like physics or biology. Neither is sociology or so-called political science. And it is difficult sometimes to identify the charlatans. But disciplined thinking about the economic aspects of our society is very useful in developing governmental policy. Mistakes are made, but more often than not they are made because ideology encourages cherry-picking the facts and gets in the way of careful analysis.	14082432	Mon Feb 09 00:00:00 CET 2015	Are Economists Overrated?

Jack Hartman	1	0	The only concrete definition of royalty I can think of is rule by decree as opposed to rule by consent. Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually. The idea that someone with ultimate power would have the right to make mistakes with no fear that the consequences could result in their removal is, well, beyond reason.	10716571	Thu Dec 12 00:00:00 CET 2013	Should Democracies Have Monarchs?

Nora	2	0	Thank you! I could not agree more. I was an avid reader as a child and have grown to be an avid reader as an adult, and I believe that being a good reader is like training for being a good listener and ultimately a good citizen of the world. Learning to enter into the worlds and personas of book characters and understand their motivations and desires is good practice for listening to the people you encounter in life and coming to understand their perspective and ideas, even if you do not agree with them or do not initially have much in common with them. Certainly, it is important for parents and teachers to have good tools that help them approach complex political topics with children. But there is no reason why it should result in giving children didactic, joyless fiction.	12252614	Thu Jul 10 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Green Eggs and Politics	Should children's books deal with issues like politics, race and sexual orientation, or just keep it light?	/roomfordebate/2014/07/09/should-books-for-childrens-be-political	Keep children's books light	Let children's books deal with issues like politics, race and sexual orientation	false	false	Keep children's books light
Andrew Terhune	3	0	What is the need for every college to have a French department? I'm a francophile, and took French in elementary school in south Florida. (Spanish would have been much more useful) Nonetheless, I have no problem with eliminating French language instruction at some colleges and universities. There will surely be many that will continue to offer French, and those who value it will seek them out.

Jim	9	0	"Anne, I believe this discussion is wrongly focused. A university that does not offer study in major languages,classics, or theater is in a sorry state. The value of offering study in the humanities should not need defending. The question, ""should the humanities be preserved?"", is absurd and offensive. A more proper question for the state of New York is ""should SUNY Albany be preserved?"". Seriously. SUNY suffers more than 60 campuses. The elimination of the humanities at one of the larger SUNY locations is a wake up call. It is time to consolidate the sprawling SUNY system so that the surviving campuses can operate competently. No one can foresee when a degree in the humanities will become ""hot"" again. SUNY Albany has chosen to ransom its future.

Gary	15	0	Making sense does not mean making cents. It makes sense to build sewers, roads, and bridges. But the private sector does not undertake these infrastructure projects because it doesn't make cents (even though these infrastructure projects were an essential foundation upon which private enterprise made its cents). The good sense of the public has funded these infrastructure projects through taxes, for cents on the dollar and for the benefit of the public and private enterprise. The humanities and the arts are the infrastructure of the mind that produces adults who make sense and make cents. I hope the good sense of the public will continue to fund the construction of these humanities programs.	2699104	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Frank Gado	1	0	No Europeancountry I am aware of requires the study of a foreignlanguage at the undergraduate level. That is taken care of, usually very well, at the high school level. At most American colleges and universities, the study of foreign languages is a ditributioin requirement. Thios preserves jobs for faculty, but in most cases, after a year of study, the student may or may not be able to hire an amburga abroad. In short, like so much else in our colleges, the study of foreign languages is a fraud. I wish all the passionate hearts here had been fighting for rigor at our colleges. The whole shebang is tumbling down--and for good reason.

Doesn't it help a businessperson to communicate with our competitors? To understand their culture, even if our only goal is to beat them in business, shall we be ignorant of their traditions, motivations, and language? Does ignorance help us compete? Seems to me that national security demands the study of foreign languages. Or shall we not bother gathering information on the Russians? How many nations in the world speak French? How many are in Asia and Africa, where business opportunities abound, as do the national security concerns Just travel to these nations to learn?

Ken Weiss	4	0	The humanities, especially at 'research' universities, can be more for the professors than the students. But cuts in the humanities and liberal arts will generate a society of one-dimensional engineers. Nothing wrong with engineers (some of my best friends are engineers!), but they then are unsophisticated societally, and become more vulnerable to demogoguery and other like-mindless politics.

C Wolfe	5	0	I'm dismayed at the number of comments that miss the point, which is that we need to preserve the integrity of our intellectual tradition. Piecemeal budget cuts are a bad thing. This is not a battle between science and the humanities; it's a battle FOR a flourishing intellectual ecosystem, which is so complex as evolved that, as with the natural ecosystem, we shouldn't be driving niches into extinction. There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes. So the argument isn't necessarily that French departments, or classics or Russian, are there to produce an army of majors. (Just enough to keep the discipline alive.) They are there to enrich everybody.	2700862	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

George	7	0	I am a physics professor at a liber I was tenured as a physics professor at a private liberal arts university about 30 years ago. Over the course of the last 15 years, new hires in physics ( and mathematics too) have been in applied, multidisciplinary fields. Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire. The loss of French departments and other humanities departments is just part of the reorganized modern university, which is an instrument of the modern nation state to attain greater wealth and power for some and a stultifying life for most. Where does this madness end?	2700855	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Tim B.	1	0	People who speak three languages are trilingual. People who speak two languages are bilingual. People who speak a single language are...for the most part...Americans. We need to ensure that the opportunity to acquire language competencies (and hopefully proficiencies) remain part of higher education. We need to encourage students of all ages and backgrounds to attain and maintain those proficiencies. Whether that can be accomplished on a large scale by distance learning using well-established tools (e.g. Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur, or other methods) needs to be explored.	2699822	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Kal	3	0	While many science and technology workers around the world speak English, certainly not all of them do. There are software companies and engineering firms all over the world where having Americans who speak these languages -- along with being able to communicate in the cultural context in which these languages exist -- is an advantage, or even a requirement to do business. Berlitz doesn't teach how to communicate engineering concepts in German, or how to sell email marketing in France, or how to gain competitive advantage in Hong Kong by knowing the language and culture. While some do feel that we should be turning out nothing but professional vocational degrees from colleges and universities, I would like to point out that my colleagues in science and technology are often terrible at communication -- language, context and culture (including American English) -- unless they study it.	2699780	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Scott Moore	4	0	Liberal arts only distract the mind from more important tasks at hand, like jobs and productivity. In past we required lofty distractions such as art and French. But after decades now of forced schooling where children have 16 years of practice doing standardized routine work on fixed schedules under authoritative disciplined systems, our workforce is now ready to dispense with these liberal niceties. The work force is now ready to just work. Sleep, wake, eat processed foods devoid of flavor, work, eat work, sleep....	2699773	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Kogan the Barbarian	1	0	BTW, I don't know about the West, but in Russia the sure way to be come a successful (sometimes great) writer seems to be to study Medicine or Engineering. Leo Tolstoy was an artillery officer and a fortification engineer, Anton Checkhov was a doctor, Michail Bulgakov was a doctor (and practiced for a while), and the lsit can be continued on and on. You see, it looks like it is relatively simple to learn French later in your life, if you so inclined, but it is much harder to become a successfull engineer or a doctor or a scientist. That's why I teach my kids - get a real job first, if you want to study Medieval English Literature, you can always do it as a hobby later on. My older kid (a high school senoir), accidentally, has had a straight A in French for the last 5 years... :)	2699711	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Claudia	5	0	As a recent MIT graduate, I feel I've seen firsthand what results when even the most brilliant college students don't sufficiently value humanities. I had to explain to a top computer scientist that as long as thousands of years ago, there were civilizations with human beings who knew how to read and write and were essentially as smart as us. Somehow, all his scientific knowledge about evolution still left him unconvinced that the Greeks and Romans may have had something to teach us. Only after I handed him a copy of Plato did he get the point. Furthermore, unless engineering-types are required to take humanities classes (at a college level, not just in high school), many of them won't. This is an injustice to society as much as to those individuals, who may never realize what they are missing.	2699604	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Bill R	7	0	These cuts could lead to an examination of the humanities in science and engineerings programs. As an engineering student I took anthropology, history, economics, and psychology courses. They were more useful than the electives in nuclear engineering. Economics was required for engineers, very reasonably, and the the psychology was required by the Navy ROTC, also with good reason. Humanities and context to science, and humanities and science together would improve the quality of many current issues, climate change is an obvious example.	2699528	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Michelle	5	0	As a French-speaking Canadian who obviously understands English, when I saw the title of the article I was looking forward to the debaters' comments. Yet no one answers the question: do colleges need French departments? Nobody mentions the unique perspective French culture, literature, philosophy and language can bring to students. Nor does any debater write about the worthlessness of French, should that be their opinion. Were there no debaters who knew something about French? And when I mention French, I refer to all countries that, through history and to this day, have lived and still live in French as well as those countries, such as the United States, that have pockets of citizens that live and think in French. If the debate was not about French departments then there is a subtle English code that I fail to decrypt.	2699328	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Margaret	4	0	It would be a shame for universities to give up the teaching of French; it is a language spoken throughout Europe. Even if we don't master the language,it is a wonderful help when traveling. The same people who will go on to financial success after college are the people who will spend vacation time touring France and Italy. Of course, the humblest waiter in France understands some English but an American appears uneducated if he/she can't even attempt speaking some French. We can't expect that all foreigners have studied English when we haven't studied some foreign language ourselves.	2699384	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Ryan O	13	0	As a recent college graduate with a degree in French, I have to say that I am disappointed that foreign language literatures are first on the chopping block. Not only does the study of literature prompt students to critically analyze texts and articulate arguments in writing, it provides students with a more well-rounded and global view of a discipline that all too often focuses on old dead white British and American men. As a student of French I have had an enormous exposure to the cultural and political issues that dominate North African, West African, and Carribean peoples. Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France. It would really be a shame to see this multifaceted and dynamic discipline disappear from some Universities because of uninformed notions that the study of French is nothing more than an American romanticization and fetishization of a European culture and language.	2699263	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

DWW	12	0	The U.S. desperately needs to strengthen its ties to the larger world. All of its failures stem from its traditional and on-going isolation. The Humanities, and in particular, the acquisition of a foreign language (culture, literature, history, alternative ways of living), are vital to broadening the professional lives of all young Americans. The study of French is the doorway to understanding our own background (some 40% of English derives from French), our history, our identity. Cutting such vital elements of education is in fact suicidal for U.S. society.	2698806	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Bruce	9	0	"This debate is misleadingly headlined ""Do Colleges Need French Departments?"". I say that because Nussbaum, and most of the others who have answered after her, are addressing the much bigger question of ""With humanities programs being cut at many universities, what do students stand to lose?"" I agree with most of what Nussbaum says, but my take on it is this: money is short, and we need to use it more wisely to ensure that all university students get a good education in humanities, be they future businesspeople, engineers or journalists. The existence of this or that four-year degree, or a given department, doesn't mean this will necessarily happen."	2698446	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Chatham H Forbes Sr	139	0	Professor Nussbaum speaks a vital truth. We have a constant push for more science and mathematics, more technology majors. The assumption is that we are losing the international sweepstakes if we don't excel other nations in these fields. We want to make the Faustian bargain, in which we choose to gain the whole world, technical ascendancy, by forfeiting our soul, the humanities. The error here, as Professor Nussbaum says, is in assuming that the two areas of study are unrelated and separable, which they are not. The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists. Today's political campaign, with its capture by extremist reactionaries of gullible voters undereducated for citizenship, demonstrates that we have an acute need for multi-dimensional education throughout our society. That ignorance extends to those who are leading the reactionaries. They also stand in great need of education in such skills as critical thinking, and in the narrative and conceptual history of their own nation.	2697634	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

D. Reid	2	0	I think we cloud the issue when we talk about learning another language. For people who will never spend more than a few weeks in a Spanish speaking or Francophone country, spending the time to learn to speak the language is of dubious worth. Learning to read and perhaps write the language is altogether another matter. If you can read Spanish, French, etc, you can read the untranslated material from each country. (Translations are always poor.) This would allow you to much better understand the world from their point of view. I no longer speak French very well, but can understand it and read it without too much difficulty. This is sufficient, and does not require a degree.	2700356	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Dee	2	0	I agree that not everyone needs French, and frankly not everyone desires to learn French. There should be a supply/demand system to which language classes to offer at a certain school. Growing up, the only choice we had was Spanish in all our public schools. Why? In a border state, it was the most useful. French is not a very useful language in the US, unless you plan on working abroad or in Canada. I don't condone removing languages entirely from education (learning any language is a useful skill), but in order to make the most of a person's time and his/her desire to learn a certain language, then offer what has the highest demand, probably these days Spanish and Mandarin, the two most spoken languages globally ahead of English. The supply/demand system should be duly noted when choosing whether a humanities degree is desirable. Is it really in demand in today's world? I don't think so.	2700000	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Ed	1	0	Having lived in Germany (Army bases) and traveled widely, I am well aware of that there are few Americans that can speak foreign languages. Most Americans cannot understand why someone would want to learn a foreign language. Having said that, my 5-6 years of French and limited German never proved of much use in those countries (many Germans speak English, and the French are less than helpful to foreigners trying to speak their language) or elsewhere. Later in life I took up Spanish, and this has proved to be very useful in travel and being able to practice it on a regular basis (Washington, DC area). I think that the colleges need to rethink their language curriculum. At an east coast boarding school I attended in the '60s, Latin classes were mandatory absent a waiver. The world has changed and French use in the world has changed dramatically. Colleges need to take this into account. It is a shame to have people spend years on these languages and then never using them in their adult life. BTW I have one niece taking college Arabic and another taking high school Spanish.	2699622	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

DBA	33	0	As a SUNY Albany graduate with a BA in foreign languages, I'm saddened by this news. Studying other languages and cultures broadens one's view of the world and it especially helps you understand your native English usage far better. I'm dismayed by how poorly people use our own language in this country, and I'm not just referring to kids today who text all the time but can't write well (although they make me crazy, too). I can't over-emphasize how much the ability to speak German and French has made a difference in my business life. With years of experience in promoting the technology industries in Europe I have a wonderful network of friends there with whom I have a far deeper personal relationship than I would have had as an English-only speaker. Fluency in other languages makes for far better outreach and involvement with people of other countries.

DG	1	0	"#12 elizabeth: Right on about the continued importance of French! French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business. So maybe - just maybe - it would be a good idea for our universities to keep teaching it."	2701665	Tue Oct 19 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Tigermoose	4	0	I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours. As I found out, when you make a profession out of the humanities, it leads to crass careerism and outlandish theory.	2701458	Tue Oct 19 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

md	2	0	I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.	2701233	Tue Oct 19 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

El Jefe	3	0	It's perhaps not surprising that those advocating the dissolution of humanities programs adopt a vocational view of the utility of language education. According to this view, the sole point of learning a foreign language is to be able to conduct business dealings in that language. If there is no need for French in the workplace, there is no need for French in the college curriculum. This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin. Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages. And by the way, it's not just French that's being extirpated at SUNY Albany - it's Italian, Russian, classics and theater, too. But that's ok, none of that has anything to do with conducting business.	2702028	Tue Oct 19 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

Paul	26	0	I was a French major my first two years at Villanova, and then dropped it, believing it was not practical. A few years later, the pharmaceutical company I was working for merged with a French company. I ended up living in France for 9 wonderful years, and the base provided by my high school and college classes gave me a great foundation for speaking the language and understanding the culture. I see the elimination of foreign language classes as one more sign of the dumbing-down of America. C'est dommage.	2700312	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

David Blum	16	0	This is the one post that I agree with. The humanities are that: a human endeavor. Language is probably the most important thing we do, both physically and mentally. It's what makes us human. Ultimately this takes us back to a question the Greeks often asked: what's a good life? What's rewarding, what's fulfilling? These days we all live relatively well, compared to our ancestors at least. Is it absolutely necessity to think purely in terms of utility? I have an HDTV, is it absolutely necessary I have a 3dTV tomorrow? Why? Studying languages and being able to communicate successfully gives insight into culture, gesture, and structure; how is that not useful? I study languages on a daily basis, and I'm not that good at them as I get older. But I liken it to exercising, like front squatting or distance running; somehow, deep down, I know it's good for me.	2698988	Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CEST 2010	Do Colleges Need French Departments?

John Andrews	1	0	That's absolutely right! The one-country/one-vote system means that it becomes all too easy to corrupt the voting system by offering inducements/bribes to representatives of poor countries. However, to change the system to favour the developed world cannot be the way to go, neither in the UN nor in FIFA. My preference (hardly ideal, but practical) would be to have a rotation of World Cup venues: Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, Middle East. This would not eradicate corruption, but might well limit its scope. And, btw, it would be a very good idea to have term limits on elected FIFA executives. Blatter after Havelange is a sequence that does not inspire confidence.	11994755	Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Does Soccer Need FIFA?

The Obama administration, naive in the extreme, though it had bought the support of Mark Bertolini and the other captains of the health insurance industry, when it had only rented them for a limited time. Now Mr. Bertolini, having failed in his effort to extort from the Justice Department a decision not to do its duty and raise anti-trust objections to AETNA's effort to create, through merger, a non-competitive insurance market, has taken his revenge on the American people. In view of the number of mergers sought and suspiciously similar requests for increases in ACA health care costs, perhaps the Justice Department should initiate an investigation of price fixing and collusion among health insurance companies. The writer, who fails to address the anti-trust issue, appears to favor Repeal and Don't Replace. How about ""Are There No Poor Houses?""

Predictably, they took up his offer to dither but refused to ultimately offer a single affirmative vote even though the plan is the Heritage Foundation's alternative to Hillary Clinton's proposal from the '90's. What Obama should have done is taken Medicare for All, jammed it through without dithering with an obstinate and mendacious bunch of saboteurs, and relished the political victory of delivering a wildly popular program. Instead, he dithered and ended up with a program that no one is willing to brag about."	19586342	Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Obamacare Sustainable?

Eric Hamilton	9	0	Turner's argument that Obamacare is inherently flawed and cannot be made to work overlooks some important counterexamples, including the success of the Swiss (and to a lesser extent the Dutch) healthcare system. Furthermore, the same basic premise (guaranteed coverage across a large risk pool without adverse selection) is working well even in America, in large employer-subsidized group plans. A responsible market-oriented conservative would be asking why Obamacare isn't working as well as those plans, not seeking to bury it without any serious analysis.	19585313	Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Obamacare Sustainable?

The Republicans dont have to raise their little finger for this program to fail, it will die of its own losses. Where are the number guys and what do they say about it now, the guys who were touting the program for Mr. Obama? Its a wonderful warm and fuzzy notion to fund healthcare for everyone, and in countries that pay their doctors around 50,000 a year and drugs aren't outrageous etc etc, it may be feasible, but thats not the USA. Check out how much money the drug companies pay our politicians for example.

John R	1	0	With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff. If the trend continues, AFA is not sustainable.	19586126	Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Is Obamacare Sustainable?

Mary L. Flett	3	0	As a Medicare provider, I see confusion on the part of most of my patients, and a serious decline in my reimbursement rate. Patients seem to look first to cost (monthly premium and pharmaceuticals), then to services. Large insurers (Aetna, Humana, Blue Cross) are in the business of making money, not providing services. Medicare (as an insurance company) is in the business of cost-control for established medical services. As long as medical care is dependent on a business model (i.e., competition), and not disease management, we will be forever in a conundrum.

It is hard to argue that marijuana should be illegal when alcohol and tobacco, both more harmful substances, are legal and widely promoted. And in your hysterical attempt to portray marijuana as the demon weed you ignore the fact that the arrests and violence that accompany marijuana use and sales do more harm than the drug actually does. I'm concerned about the fact that many kids don't understand that marijuana is harmful. Not only does it lead to demotivation in some, it now appears that it can permanenty lower the IQ of a teenage user by some 9 points. But alcohol also damages the teenage brain. What we need here is education, not prohibition, and a ban on advertising and promotion -- something we should have for alcohol and tobacco as well, but do not.	11969936	Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Did Colorado Go Too Far With Pot?

Henry	10	0	We have hundreds of thousands of scientists; we have hundreds of major universities; and millions of marijuana users over the last fifty years. So, why so little good research? Blame the federal government which made marijuana research unduly difficult. and similar foreign governments. A Catch 22: little research since marijuana is illegal; illegal party because little research showing it is relatively safe. Somebody had to blow this dam of repression sky high; Colorado has done this. Now, belatedly, the research can go on.	11965391	Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Did Colorado Go Too Far With Pot?

James	11	0	Arguments such as these frustrate me. When Dr. Evins comes up with a solution to the downsides of keeping marijuana illegal (which any 16-year old in the country can find now without any difficulty whatsoever), not limited to the money flowing to drug cartels, the violence associated with illegal distribution, the racial and ethnic differences in lives lost, ruined and diminished due to disparities in criminal justice processing, (should I go on?), I'll take state control and distribution any day of the week. If she wants to whine about the marketing to children, tell her to go whine to all those free-market Republicans who believe that the markets can do no harm. Maybe they should be required to take the Hippocratic Oath.	11966497	Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Did Colorado Go Too Far With Pot?	Was the move to legalize marijuana done too quickly?

fs	9	0	"In 2013, the American Medical Association's 527-member House of Delegates revised the AMA's position, in place since 1977, that urged ""modification of state law to reduce the severity of penalties for possession of marijuana."" Of course, the US government blithely ignored this advice ever since it was given and went on to arrest over thirty million citizens for possession. The AMA delegates also endorsed a review of the ""risks and benefits"" of new legal markets in Colorado and Washington. One of those ""benefits"" is readily apparent - an average of 714 people per month were arrested in Colorado for possession in the first nine months of 2012. Arrest numbers have dropped over 80% in Colorado since legalization. Every person not arrested is a tragedy avoided. Many argue for a ""go slow"" approach to legalization - exactly what we've seen for decades. The American Medical Association should speak forcefully of the health dangers of incarceration, the psychological damage of being arrested and incarcerated, and on behalf of the millions who would benefit from cannabis as medicine."	11965623	Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Did Colorado Go Too Far With Pot?

Jake	6	0	"I'd like to know where Dr. Evins is getting her statistics. They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause ""like memory and cognitive impairment""--TEMPORARILY. It's called ""being stoned""."	11965482	Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Did Colorado Go Too Far With Pot?	Was the move to legalize marijuana done too quickly?

m.a.	28	0	I hate pot. I think putting it in candy is stupid. However, even though I gave it up after 2 years of thinking thee must be something wrong with me for not enjoying it, I came to the conclusion that it was so far from addictive that it probably drove some people to abandon it in favor of mindless drug like cocaine, heroin or beer and booze. If the AMA and foolish and misinformed people like MS Evins believe the nonsense they spread; let them sleep alone. I suspect that almost all hardcore users of pot are already using it. If Ms Evins were truly honest ,she would be pushing for re-enactment of alcohol prohibition, which , like all drug prohibitions, didn't work either, but was at least based upon a great deal of experimental and observed fact. All our history with marijuana is based upon the predilections of one side or the other in the argument over it's status.	11963803	Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Did Colorado Go Too Far With Pot?

wolfe	21	0	Maureen Dowd had a bad trip and so we all supposed to return to the dark ages of marijuana use. I drank a pitcher of Cabo Wabo marguarettas a couple of weeks ago and thought I was going to die the next day. Are we going to prohibit tequila because of my bad trip? I wish! Dang that stuff is good. Too good for amateurs like me. I don't know if bottlers still put the alcohol content on hard liquor, but they used to. It was a handy guide for beginning drinkers.....like college students. But then some people used it as a guide to get as drunk as possible, as fast as possible. You cannot legislate the stupidity out of people and you cannot protect them from every thing. But creating a THC meter and putting it on the package would be very considerate. It probably wouldn't help stupid people like the above mentioned columnist, who just crammed the stuff in her mouth without even doing any research, but it would show a sense of responsibility on the part of the marijuana industry.	11967563	Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 CEST 2014	Did Colorado Go Too Far With Pot?

Jon F	2	0	Criminals should not be allowed to vote. They have no business electing people who make the laws once they have been convicted of breaking the law. Perhaps, if a released offender has gone 5 years without convicting another crime then his voting rights can be restored. But to restore voting rights to newly released convicts is crazy since a fairly high percentage of these people will end up back in prison anyway. We are better off keeping them in jail for longer time periods instead of letting them out to vote.	18328018	Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

WSF	1	0	I agree that once an obligation to Society has been made by serving the penalty assessed at trial, the felon should be restored to full citizenship. Having said that I would add a period of time, say five years of good behavior after release from prison, before voting rights are restored. There should be a burden of proof that a felon must endure to prove that he or she can be a good citizen once again before voting rights can be exercised. This can only be done after the felon has been back in free society for some time.	18321856	Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

Gerard	1	0	The racial argument is a distraction: relevant to the repudiation of other policies but not this one. The real question is whether our right to vote should be linked to compliance to law. I suggest that a due process argument applies. While criminals were sentenced under due process, the removal of voting rights was attached not by the court but by the legislature without reference to the particular case. If illegal action is thus punished, should we include traffic offenses? Late filing of taxes? Disenfranchisement seem an unusual and arbitrary punishment and is not handled by the judiciary to whom the constitution gave the authority in sentencing. Star Ship Troopers was a dreadful, great movie: but it held that the right to vote was earned by military service. In America, the right is not explicitly defined but I suggest that it is implicitly based on citizenship and felons remain citizens. You may not like that they can vote, but that should hold no greater weight that your dislike of that idiot down the street with all those dumb signs in his yard.	18321565	Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

Dave	28	0	Most definitely, I agree that felons should be allowed to vote. Their rights should not even be suspended in my opinion, not for a day. Taking away the right to vote is the ultimate affront in a so-called democracy, and it helps create the downward spiral of criminals in our system. It is just another reason that once a person becomes a felon, they have very little chance of ever succeeded in this country. They'd be much better off leaving the country, however even that right is removed. Criminals are citizens too. This antiquated idea of removing voting rights is akin to the policies you see in North Korean.	18303085	Sat Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

Bill	2	0	We live in a society where the criminal charges that a defendant faces and the likelihood of conviction depend very strongly upon how much money the defendant can spend for legal representation. As long as that remains true (and it is true), Roger Clegg's argument remains invalid. There are very many poor people in prison for non-violent crimes that were prosecuted while the defendant was too young and too poor to pay for legal representation. Many of them would not have been convicted of felony crimes if could have afforded a competent attorney. Thus, the blanket denial of suffrage for all felons cannot be justified.	18410631	Wed May 04 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

On that alone, society benefits. Based on past standards for disenfranchisement, neither George W. Bush or Dick Cheney would have been able to vote in years past. Andrew Jackson killed two people in duels. Times change and our standards evolve.

Sail Away	1	0	There are a lot of politicians who make laws before they go to prison, or before they are found guilty of ethics violations. And many who write laws to give politicians relative indemnity. Any politician who claims convicted felons shouldn't vote more or less consider themselves above the law. Those who are convicted felons are not always guilty of the crimes they were convicted of, and when they are, they are a fraction of Americans who have committed crimes but not caught. Most Americans are guilty of some violation of law during there lifetime. Refusing to treat all people with dignity and make them feel forgiven and responsible citizens is a greater crime than most convicted felons are imprisoned for.	18321217	Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

Dectra	27	0	The prohibition on voting for individuals who have served their appointed time is nothing more than a naked, partisan attempt to disenfranchise more voters, albeit ones who would likely not support the GOP. The courts, when given the responsibility to do so, have passed sentence for crimes committed. The GOP would then add to (immorally so, in my opinion) an extra punishment; the denial of the right to vote. For those who decry the actions of a duly elected Governor to bring these individuals back into the realm of civilized society by making their voices part of the national discussion is mind blowing. For those who oppose this, how many stones do you get to throw at one who has wronged society? Fifty? Hundreds? If you really wish to integrate people back into normal, civilized behavior, why do you continue to punish them above and beyond what the Court has ruled as their sentence?	18319592	Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

nycmacguy	11	0	Our drug laws would probably have been liberalized far sooner if we had simply allowed all US citizens to vote including former felons and even those incarcerated. Our politicians would probably be paying attention to the issue of recidivism if the people most affected by it were people who could vote. Improving educational and employment prospects for former felons would become a priority if these people were in fact voters. Wrongful convictions, which still happen with far too much frequency in America, would get the extra special attention they deserve if we allowed felons to vote. By disenfranchising this entire group of people, we have created a system that ignores the serious issues related to this population. We have the highest incarceration rate in the world and we disenfranchise millions who are formerly incarcerated because of past mistakes. This process further exacerbates the challenges of ethnic minorities and the working poor. We need to empower all US citizens to be able to participate in our democracy so we can start to create the more equal and fair society we all claim to support.	18319561	Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

Some will argue that if they have paid their debt to society they should be automatically be restored, but we make sex offenders register and limit their housing choices. Child molesters are forbidden from some occupations. We do limit the rights and freedoms of some felons even after they have served their time. I do not believe anyone convicted of a violent crime should ever be able to own guns.	18319483	Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

stephen	4	0	I live in Florida which makes it very difficult to restore civil rights to felons. The laws have become a new form of Jim Crow to prevent minorities from voting. Your chance of becoming a felon is much greater if you are dark of skin hue. Or a different ethnicity than being a WASP. Time to end this persecution of people We need to reform our justice system.. After release all voting rights should be restored .

NotJamesMadison	8	0	Isn't federalism wonderful. States can be laboratories for democracy, ... except when they do something judged inappropriate. Can we expect Roger Clegg and his friends to take up the fight to deny felons the votes in Maine and Vermont, which do not disenfranchise their felons at all, or in the states that re-enfranchise their felon on release from prison. More importantly, it's time to ensure that the census counts incarcerated felons at their place of last residence rather than their prison? Counting the incarcerated at their prisons boosts the legislative representation of the prison areas at the expense of the prisoners' real neighborhoods.	18302711	Sat Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

Walter Rhett	49	0	Roger Clegg claims victim blaming at its worst. The punishment for a crime has ended, but the lost of privilege that connects people in a democracy--voting--is denied by a self-righteous presumption that a person is worthless beyond the crime. His logic obliterates both law and justice. It fails to account for bias while reinforcing bias. It is the circular firing squad of the right wing, wrapped in the outrageous exaggeration of the broken logic of the right wing's appeals. It judges--without justice.	18302110	Sat Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

David Underwood	45	0	"So this thesis is ""Once a felon, always a felon?"" The stated purpose of incarceration correction. In California it is the CDC or California Department of Corrections, not the prison department. A convict is released, put on parole, satisfies the requirements, and is expected to become a normal member of society. But at the same time loses certain right that other citizens have. He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. So even though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected. Worse yet, in many cases they can not get certain work, are relegated to the lower levels of society, yet expected to be productive. So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration? Some may be career criminals, but as we have seen fr to many times, most are not, but in many cases return to crime as that is what they know best. What we see here is a call for permanent retribution, no matter the crime."	18301314	Sat Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2016	Should Felons Ever Be Allowed to Vote?

Lori	10	0	As a psychologist, I would like to point out that while there are certainly abuses with psychiatric drugs, I see the opposite in my practice. Almost of of my patients vehemently oppose the use of anti-depressants even when they are clearly indicated. I work with them in psychotherapy, but in many cases the results of the therapy (many forms of therapy, including evidenced based cogntive-behavioral, interpersonal, etc). are quite slow, limited, sometimes non-existent, and there is often relapse. In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well. The problem is not antidepressants per se, its the improper consumer advertsising, further mis-prescription and monitoring of the drugs, and lack of referral for effective psychotherapy in conjunction with meds.	13001294	Wed Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2014	The State of the Prozac Nation	Was the antidepressant a true step forward in medicine, or did it just open the flood gates to aggressive marketing and branding of drugs?	/roomfordebate/2014/10/07/did-the-blockbuster-prozac-help-or-hurt-medicine	Prozac just opened the flood gates to marketing	Prozac was a true step forward in medicine	false	false	Prozac was a true step forward in medicine
Meredith	3	0	I believe it's true that Prozac along with talk therapy has been more effective than either alone for many depressed people. And not years of psychoanalysis either, but limited time cognitive therapy. The Prozac lessens the feeling of being out of control, subject to moods with little power over them. Then once that takes effect, the person can benefit from therapy, gaining some objectivity and distance from what had previously overwhelmed them. This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs. Budget cutting has lessened availability of mental health treatment, leading to crime, violence, family pathology and incarceration. We should study the methods used in the many countries with universal tax supported health care. What are their mental health budgets, and how do they treat with Prozac type drugs and therapy where needed? Have these countries reduced funding for mental health as part of a spending austerity campaigns?	12997439	Wed Oct 08 00:00:00 CEST 2014	The State of the Prozac Nation	Was the antidepressant a true step forward in medicine, or did it just open the flood gates to aggressive marketing and branding of drugs?	/roomfordebate/2014/10/07/did-the-blockbuster-prozac-help-or-hurt-medicine	Prozac just opened the flood gates to marketing	Prozac was a true step forward in medicine	false	false	Prozac was a true step forward in medicine
R Harvey	31	0	As a psychiatrist who treats depression, especially severe depression, I agree with all the pleas, such as that by Ashley from UK, to use absolutely everything to help those who suffer from this awful condition: diet, exercise, meditation, CBT, group therapy, supplements, yoga, acupuncture, religion or voodoo. And yes, medication. Many are only minimally helped, some not at all, but also many are rendered completely symptom free by medications. The brain, ill or not, is mysterious, but the suffering that can dwell there can be profound. Yes, give me Prozac for the patients it will help, and all the newest over-hyped meds like Viibryd and Brintellix as well, and whatever else can be concocted.

JH	1	0	As an employer I would consider my work staff as an image of my business. What image does an obese physical therapist, nurse, or PE teacher send. Or a waiter presenting the dessert menu unable to squeeze through the tables to get to the table. The vast majority of the obese are less healthy because of it. Heavy may not always mean unhealthy stats, but losing the weight won't make them less healthy. It is true that some people lose weight more easily. And losing weight often means feeling hungry and deprived, but it remains a choice. Eat few calories than you use and you lose. I see nothing wrong with making folk responsible for choices they make. I wear glasses, pretty blind without them....legally so. Should I demand that folk accept my status if I chose not to accept the responsibility of wearing glasses, their expense, discomfort etc.? I could not read directions, find the proper door..... My disability would, uncorrected, make me less valuable. No employer should be expected to hire less than the best for any position.	4969864	Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

Talbot	16	0	As we move towards allowing employers to discriminate based on public health, we will surely want to allow them to prefer younger to older workers, since older workers are more likely to get sick.

WW	6	0	I have no objection to marketplace incentives, especially in health care charges, for all sorts of lifestyle choices that can be plausibly linked to lower medical costs or increased productivity. However, when you charge the overweight or the smoker extra, please also charge the motorcycle owner, the weekend skier or mountain climber, the underweight, insert your own risk factor here. I also do not care whether employers choose the more attractive of candidates, as they usually do. The effect of good looks and pleasing appearance is well known to every one of us who doesn't have all that much of it.

And here I sit still, @ a 35 BMI. There are nights I've cried myself to sleep, exhausted and sore while my body mocks my attempts to reach my 'right' BMI.

patientpatient	28	0	The argument over punishing overweight people is a classic battle over manipulation and control, as antidemocratic and aristocratic as they come. It presumes that an employer or an insurance company has a right to make a judgment on employees' personal lives, which is every bit as offensive as arguing that the government should do it.

Calvert Cliffs	10	0	Plus which, in a society that discriminates ferociously against fat, nobody is ever going to accurately disentangle the cause and effect relationships between discrimination and disability.

Chrism	50	0	I don't have an answer to the obesity hiring problem, but I do have some experience in how much obese employees can cost an employer. Obesity causes heart problems, diabetes onset, fallen arches (not a lightweight disability), and a variety of other problems. When I worked as a benefits administrator for a large corporation on the East Coast I saw first-hand the cost of obesity to the obese employee and to the company. Harsh as it may be, companies probably do not hire obese people if they can find a way not to. FYI: obesity does not mean plump or overweight, it means debilitating obesity. How does an obese truck driver get into the cab of his truck? At some point, he can't. How does an obese service technician get down the basement stairs in an old house? At some point he can't, especially if he is carrying his tools. And, when does an obese employee become diabetic, with all attendant problems, e.g. dead tissue on feet. Obesity is not something to defend at all costs; obesity is something to help the obese person treat and become healthy.	4963404	Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

Daydreamer	1	0	Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors. Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field. If you have an addiction, any addiction, you should be treated equally in the workplace.	4969850	Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

madrona	13	0	During my career as a college administrator I interviewed my fair share of obese job applicants for professional positions. Regardless of their intellect or job experience, there was no chance of their being hired. Why? Because they couldn't fit in the chairs at the conference table where search committees met. They sat on the edge of chairs and almost fell forward trying to balance, which didn't do much for their concentrating on complex question from faculty members. They were constantly out of breath, and sweating, and struggled to reach for the glass of water set before them. They could barely walk to various sites around campus for a required tour, and in some cases, wouldn't even try. They shuffled down the halls while their fit escorts waited, if not patiently, certainly politely. Faculty and other professional jobs require energy and stamina. No amount of intellect can overcome these kinds of self-induced problems, and discrimination is really irrelevant in such cases when one considers the terrible burden such people impose on employers.	4966919	Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

SouthernView	1	0	I generally rest on the more progressive side of the political spectrum and believe that government has a role to play in keeping America the best country on earth. But reading many of the postings on these pages, I can see why so many of my fellow Americans have come to loathe government and equate all government regulation with pure evil. I am appalled at the apologia for obesity expressed here. The idea that people who eat themselves into poor health should be some sort of protected class of Americans blows my mind. Government should only be used to protect people who are suffering through no fault of their own, not as a crutch for people who have abandoned any sense of personal responsibility. I hope liberals and progressives can wake up and realize that when you pass laws that protect such irresponsibility, you undermine any effort to restrain the real villains, like the corporate crooks that control America.	4971310	Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

CJ	12	0	Obesity is a complex problem that cannot simply be reduced to eating too much. Genetics, some mental illnesses and medications are often factors. There are other factors that we do not yet know about. Obesity seems to be the last great bastion of acceptable prejudice in our society. Derision and prejudice that is now unacceptable (and rightly so) for blacks, gays, the disabled and other minority groups apparently is still okay for our obese citizens. Maybe we should think about that.	4967322	Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

grannychi	11	0	Please, let us not degenerate into a situation whereby an employer, when faced with two qualified candidates, one obese, one not, MUST hire the obese person or face a lawsuit or penalty! What about the rights of the non-obese candidate? What about the financial repercussions on existing employees, whose medical insurance payments rise even more? And how can an employer expect that an employee will respect his company when that employee clearly doesn't respect his own most valuable possession??? An obese person may feel healthy at the moment, but s/he is living on dwindling organ reserves. One day, things shut down, including the liver, with possible need for a liver transplant and lifelong immunosuppression with attendant complications. The pain of diabetic neuropathy, potential blindness, kidney failure... A person who intentionally puts him- or herself in this position can hardly be a choice possibility as a dedicated employee.	4965952	Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

John	9	0	I was obese. Then, undergraduate school and white crosses changed that. I am aware that my opinion will be challenged, but we should not discriminate in any manner against obesity. Why? Because it's not the right way to treat people. All of the evidence presented in this debate is valid. Particularly that on the costs of our health and its burden on others. I do not believe that there is one obese person that would choose to remain obese if a miracle drug could return them to a normal weight. Obesity is a physical and an emotional nightmare. It eats at you (no pun intended) every hour of the day. We have irrefutable proof that it's thoroughly toxic, in every sense of the word. And yes, we should, as a people, be nutritionally sophisticated. Yet, we're not - we're nowhere near. But, by adopting many of these reforms and legislating stiff penalties, we are just going too far. Have we sunk so low that we are now to make laws and develop policies against the physique of our neighbor? The very thought is insane. There are better ways to solve this problem.	4968778	Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

Josh Hill	3	0	"""All the medical evidence points to the fact that it's nearly impossible to keep off weight once lost. The body just won't let you."" This is incorrect, and could lead to fatalism that could harm people who are overweight. For example, I lost 70 pounds. That was at least a year ago. It has not come back. It is easy to keep off. The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day. Exercise has also been shown to help prevent the return of weight, though it isn't useful as a weight loss tool. Sadly, what is known today is far different from the older diet and exercise advice that many still follow."	4966940	Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CET 2011	Should Legislation Protect the Obese?

I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese ""he could not earn a living (sic!)"". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight.

lofie	7	0	I meet the definition of obese. The reason I am obese is that I eat more calories than I burn. On occassion i go on diets and lose lots of weight. My blood pressure falls precipitously and I feel better. If an employer refuses to hire me because I'm fat--yes, fat, that is my problem not his. He didn't heat the extra pizza...I ate it. Why in the world should he be required by law to incur higher medical bills and lost days at work because I decide to stuff my face with pizza or ice cream? It makes no sense any more than it makes sense for people be required by law to pay the health costs for people who acquire a disease because of their voluntary participation in unprotected sex activities or ride motorcycles without helmets or smoke cigarettes.

Canistercok	4	0	If one steps on a tack with a bare foot one learns to watch out for tacks or put on shoes! If we 'coddle' the obese they have little reason to stop eating fattening food. While genetics does play some part in the problem it just means that individual must make more effort to overcome it. I guess we have to come down to 'survival of the fittest' or we will burden down the healthy in our society until they are drowned and doomed by the unhealthy. Healthcare premiums need to relate to unhealthy actions of individuals. Smoking, excess drinking, drug use and over eating etc., need to have penalties but right now we have set up the a system that requires the responsible healthy to pay their bills for them so WHO CARES!. Employers have no responsibility to take on everyones problems and neither does the healthy members of society.

Let's face it, regardless of the why, most obese people simply eat too much and exercise too little. They're not all victims of bad glands. In a world of ever more limited resources, we really can't afford the nicety of treeating the impulsive, the selfish and the self-destructive too kindly.

Bill	1	0	Throughout my school years--from elementary school on--I was completely incompetent in every kind of physical activity that I tried. As a result, in the competitive environment that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s (and, I suspect, continues to the present), I was not just sidelined but humiliated, and not just by my fellow students, but by adult coaches, too. To this day, I hate sports. Now, in my 60s, I wish there had been programs for kids like me, that might have introduced me to physical exercise in a non-competitive setting. Maybe I could have become more physically active and found some healthy physical activities that I could enjoy.	8837337	Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Dropping the Ball	Should more undergraduate schools follow in the footsteps of Spelman College and consider dropping intercollegiate sports programs?	/roomfordebate/2013/04/22/should-colleges-get-rid-of-competitive-sports	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools	false	false	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools
DavGreg	3	0	My understanding is that college athletic teams were started to teach leadership, discipline and teamwork to students. With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price.

Alice Clark	9	0	"I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: ""Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports."" I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that ""there is no going back."" How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations?

MIT has more sports teams than any other university, I am led to believe. (Except football). They both exercised my grey cells.

The fact that high-stakes college athletics are in synergy with this larger trend is no recommendation in their favor. As to the idea that ""there is no going back"", well, that's pretty feeble, too. In 1988 in Moscow I'm sure that most people, including everyone in the Politburo, would have told you that the Soviet system in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe was so firmly ensconced in power that ""there's no going back"".

jp-ia	1	0	College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog. They end up dictating student life in many cases, lead to undesirable behaviors (from riots to binge drinking), and negatively affect students' ability to focus on academics. On good years, sports do just enough to fund themselves. During bad result spells, they end up eating up significant amounts of money. It's hard to get rid of them, especially at big state schools, because many donors seem to identify more with the teams than with the university. I'd either go the Division III route, and also provide the option for the teams to go pro while paying a license fee to the college for use of their logo and name. Pay the athletes, give them contracts, and keep the finances of the teams and the schools separate.	8837139	Wed Apr 24 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Dropping the Ball	Should more undergraduate schools follow in the footsteps of Spelman College and consider dropping intercollegiate sports programs?	/roomfordebate/2013/04/22/should-colleges-get-rid-of-competitive-sports	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools	false	false	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools
Casual Observer	1	0	For a small college dropping such sports programs is probably wise but for the big schools, it's not. The Penn State scandal brought out all the reasons that intermural athletics which draws popular audiences can undo an institution of higher learning. The enormous amounts of money from the media, media sponsors, alumni and fans of the sports programs led to the University finding itself incapable of dealing with a serial pedophile on it's staff. But these programs do bring lots of revenue which all of the other activities of a University simply don't. There are no taxpayers in this country willing to support the education of other peoples children, anymore. The costs of going from papers and books to electronic communications as well as the collapse of actual wealth creation in this country has raised the costs of doing everything that Universities do. The revenues from NCAA athletics are very important.	8835695	Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Dropping the Ball	Should more undergraduate schools follow in the footsteps of Spelman College and consider dropping intercollegiate sports programs?	/roomfordebate/2013/04/22/should-colleges-get-rid-of-competitive-sports	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools	false	false	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools

raphael colb	8	0	Israeli universities are serious academic institutions with some sports for fitness and recreation, but little in the way of organized competition. After the army, students are ready to begin real life: get a career, get married, and go to work (often while they are at college). They seem undiminished by the lack of sports in their life and their schools set an example of what American college life could be if it were cured of sports mania. Bravo for Spellman and other schools that divest from intercollegiate sport and reinvest in the education, health, and maturation of their students. Their graduates will have an edge because of it.	8833835	Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Dropping the Ball	Should more undergraduate schools follow in the footsteps of Spelman College and consider dropping intercollegiate sports programs?	/roomfordebate/2013/04/22/should-colleges-get-rid-of-competitive-sports	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools	false	false	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools
truthbetold2	3	0	The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball. (That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise.	8832705	Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Dropping the Ball	Should more undergraduate schools follow in the footsteps of Spelman College and consider dropping intercollegiate sports programs?	/roomfordebate/2013/04/22/should-colleges-get-rid-of-competitive-sports	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools	false	false	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools
Bert Chadick	3	0	The threat to kill college semi-pro sports serves the purpose of forcing the system to curb its excesses. Slashing coaches' salries to professorial levels and bringing student athletes back into the regular curriculum would be a good start. Big TV money should also be fed back into the university to support the school's academic programs rather than the other way around. The alumni can build those sports palaces that they demand and the universities could lease them the land on campus at a market rate. Alumni have more clout than the NRA but it isn't as well organized. The big games are a way these graduates can connect with the best years of their lives and that is why changes will be difficult.	8833880	Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Dropping the Ball	Should more undergraduate schools follow in the footsteps of Spelman College and consider dropping intercollegiate sports programs?	/roomfordebate/2013/04/22/should-colleges-get-rid-of-competitive-sports	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools	true	false	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools
fedup	7	0	The money spent on intercollegiate athletics could be better spent. How much of college fees go directly to athletics in which a small percentage of students participate? My daughter has a PhD and teaches at a state university with great athletics. She makes less than $45,000 a year although instructors have gone through an arbitration process. The school refuses to go along with the decision reached (for five years - wages frozen). With so many colleges not hiring, she considers herself lucky to have a job. And yet, the athletic department is not sharing the pain. It is time to recommit to the purpose of higher education. I am assuming here that it is not to teach football. If it is, then they should be paying tuition not getting athletic scholarships.	8833069	Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Dropping the Ball	Should more undergraduate schools follow in the footsteps of Spelman College and consider dropping intercollegiate sports programs?	/roomfordebate/2013/04/22/should-colleges-get-rid-of-competitive-sports	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools	false	false	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools
Eric	3	0	As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc..

Elena	5	0	Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money.	8831573	Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 CEST 2013	Dropping the Ball	Should more undergraduate schools follow in the footsteps of Spelman College and consider dropping intercollegiate sports programs?	/roomfordebate/2013/04/22/should-colleges-get-rid-of-competitive-sports	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools	Drop sports program in undergraduate schools	false	false	Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools

Tara	33	0	I have two extremely gifted children with ADHD. Their bodies are constantly in motion, and when they were younger, they could be up and wandering the classroom without even being aware of it. They would blurt out answers, talk with their peers, and fidget ceaselessly. Part of it was boredom, yes, but with medication, they were able to learn how to monitor their behavior, to slow down their bodies, and to interact appropriately with their classmates. The teacher was able to provide enrichment lessons instead of focusing on their disruptive behavior. We parents were able to teach them self-control techniques. As they aged, we were able to wean them off meds, and they function just fine in high school. Unmedicated, I doubt they would have received the appropriately differentiated education that has allowed them to succeed in school. If a child truly has ADHD, then denying them medication is the equivalent of denying a near-sighted child glasses.	17412381	Mon Feb 01 00:00:00 CET 2016	Is the A.D.H.D.

Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area.

I refused to put him through any of that. And he's done very well. I'd say the school deserves the majority of the credit for where my son is today. We went from spending 4 hours of guided help on homework on a nightly basis to him doing his homework all on his own without any help and having it completed in 20-45 mins.

GvdW	12	0	I agree with the comments that Taiwan is a democracy now, and that the US needs to side with democracy in Asia. China is by all accounts still very undemocratic and is fighting the tail end of a Civil War with the Chinese Nationalists with which Taiwan had very little to do, but Taiwan's future as a free and democratic nation is now being held hostage to that Civil War. The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member. In the 1950s and 1960s we made the mistake of isolating China. Now we are making the mistake of letting Taiwan dangle in diplomatic isolation. The people in Taiwan deserve better from us.	4580800	Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the U.S. Keep Selling Arms to Taiwan?

Gevalt	17	0	No one here in the US that I know of perceives war as inevitable between the US and China. The reality is that as China grows economically it will be less likely to wage war on those who buy its products. As the economies of the world collapse and China sees its own economy falter, China will not do anything to worsen its own precarious situation. Taiwan is 1000 times more productive, has a far higher living standard and self-reliant than a China run by the Chinese Communist Party has ever been. The US and the entire world needs to recognize that Taiwan is the only real friend of democracy in that region. Taiwan must be armed and protected from Chinese aggression. The Chinese people believe the lies that they have been fed since birth on Taiwan being Chinese territory. We need not play this game and feed these lies. Chinese nationalism is not our concern. When China collapses it will be due to economic incompetence, greed, centralized party control and massive corruption on the local level. Taiwan will forever remain independent in fact if not eventually in name.	4579961	Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the U.S. Keep Selling Arms to Taiwan?

Hairshirt	8	0	If the goal is to secure Taiwan's military capacity then I would have to agree with William Murray's point about providing flexible defensive weaponry. Thus I can only believe that the sale is all about providing the image that the Taiwan Relations Act is being upheld while enjoying the near term benefits of a large arms sale deal. China will object and possibly react in some small way as a matter of saving face, all the while knowing that this sale is an empty gesture. So for the time being nothing has changed. I think we are looking towards a day, which may have already arrived unannounced, when Taiwan is seen by China as the keystone in a strategic necklace that stretches around the throat of its Pacific borders. Someday China will want to cut the necklace and Taiwan is its weakest point. Moreover, it could be framed as the final act of a play put on pause in 1949, an internal Chinese affair. There is an air of inevitability about China reclaiming Taiwan. This latest arms deal does nothing to change that view, so for now the US is again whistling past the graveyard.	4579790	Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CEST 2011	Should the U.S. Keep Selling Arms to Taiwan?

maryaskew	1	0	Bruce S. Cooper's reasoning lacks supporting evidence: home-schooling parents do not save the taxpayers any money just as parents' whose ill children miss several days of public school do not save taxpayers money. Nor do parents who send their children to parochial schools save tax dollars. Public schools still have to be built, maintained and staffed regardless of whether some families keep its children at home or choose to send their children to private or parochial schools. Public education must plan and staff to educate _every_ child in the district. I have yet to see any empirical evidence to support the idea that home-schooling or private or religious schools save the taxpayers' money. Flinging around statistics about the average per pupil cost of public education is not the same thing as providing evidence that private or home education reduce the necessary expenditures of public school systems. Can anyone cite any tax bill which was reduced when when parochial schools closed? Mary Askew	3211836	Tue Jan 11 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

Stephen DeLuca	6	0	EVERYONE uses public education. Do home-schoolers only patronize home-schooled plumbers, or nurses, or telephone repairpersons? Public education makes possible what we all live with in this Res Publica. Private education is a step back to the 17th century. Mexico is a good example of where the no-tax, limited government crowd wants to go. Having lived in Mexico for four years, where public education is severely underfunded and anyone who expects to get ahead is determined to use private education, I can attest to the benefits of a good putlic education system.	3173227	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

David	36	0	I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it.	3171929	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

Wyatt	3	0	I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers. If more lefties jumped in the flavor of the whole thing could be changed.

Just a guy	14	0	Although I have no idea what studies show about home schooled kids, I do know that, having hired two of them, my impression is not favorable. Both were prima donnas who spent a lot of time complaining about work rules, who thought that they should be able to change work processes to suit them, and who resorted to crying and making scenes to try and get their way with co-workers. The public school system was established primarily as a benefit to society, not just the individual child. That is why we all pay taxes to the schools whether we have kids or not. If people want to take their children out, so be it -- but they still still have their obligation to support the schools.	3172268	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

Sean Martin	52	0	">> ""Many parents will purchase educational materials to use at home to foster a love of learning in their children."" That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school. Maybe it's not fundamentalist enough -- which I suspect is the major reason for home schooling, given that about the only place I see home-schooling materials on sale is at conservative Christian bookstores. These parents have opted out of the system and think they can just walk away from their obligation to society in general? Sorry, sir, but no. They made the choice and they must live with the consequences. I will never raise children, but I understand the necessity of paying local school taxes. If these parents are going off the education grid, so be it -- but they must understand they do it on their own volition. They can no more walk away from their obligation to pay school taxes than I can, and for them (and you!) to claim otherwise is providing a truly lousy example to their children of what citizenship means."	3171327	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

DaveW	25	0	"#1, children educated at home turn out to be better socialized than their public schooled counterparts. They are more likely to vote, more likely to get involved in government, and more likely to volunteer for various charitable activities. And, on average, they are better educated. Sending one's children to a public school is on average, the bad decision. While there are good public schools and good public school teachers, there are also countless schools where children do not learn, are not safe (from other students and teachers), and do not get properly socialized. I know this from countless studies and personal experience. My three children, educated at home from birth, are all national merit finalists and prepared to deal with people in the real world because they were in the real world their entire lives, rather than being segregated by age and demographic in a public (aka government compulsory) school. And, I am the graduate of the esteemed Miami-Dade County Public School system, possibly the most corrupt, crime ridden, drug-infested institution in the country."	3171096	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

The federal government should not be financing education, either directly through grants or indirectly through tax credits. Education is a 100% responsibility and obligation of the states. I do support tax credits by the separate states, however.

Susan Detwiler	2	0	Tax breaks for home schoolers should only be considered in the same breath as tax breaks for those who send their kids to private or parochial schools. There is no difference. All of these individuals are opting out of the publicly provided education which shapes our society. The purpose of public schools is not only to educate all children, but to create an educated citizenry that will serve our country well, with the shared values of our American society. Those who opt out - whether to send their children to private school, religious school, or keep them home - are making a choice with their discretionary dollars.	3175505	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

Like, utterly unsustainable and irrational job protections for teachers regardless of ability or effectiveness? The way public education is now is itself a threat to our future standing in the world.

George	8	0	I do not necessarily believe that the present school model of public, charter, parrochial, private schools, etc. is the only way to educate our children. However the idea that because one does not use a public service one does not have to pay for it is absurd. If you follow this logic, then every taxpayer can choose how much taxes to pay based on what services he (or she) uses. Personally I don't think all these wars are benefitting me in any way, so I then will deduct the percentage of tax that funds the wars. I use only certain roads so I will deduct my portion that goes to fix the roads I never travel. This is ridiculous!	3173879	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

AHH	7	0	Local schools are financed almost exclusively without federal tax dollars. Therefore it does not make sense to offer a tax credit for home schooling from federal income taxes. If individual states or local governments want to offer tax credits or other incentives for home schooling, that would be appropriate, since it is mostly from state income or local property taxes that most schools are funded. In my opinion, though, they shouldn't. If you offer tax credits to home schooling parents, surely you will also want to offer tax credits to parents of private school students, and families with no school age children too, for that matter. By the time you are done, you don't have tax credits any more, you essentially have an additional tax paid only by families with children enrolled in public schools. Why not just get rid of public schools all together and only have private schooling?	3173402	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

Alan J. Barnes	14	0	May I ask why a Federal Tax Credit is requested for those who home-school when education is a State-based function. States, counties, cities collect the property, sales, and other local taxes and assessments which fund the local public schools, libraries, playgrounds, parks, and many other community-based educational and cultural resources. I am puzzled that those who so ardently shout for the preservation of States Rights seem to be inviting the Federal Government into their home to demand oversight of their children's school curriculum and evaluate their performance. Am I missing something here or is there some kind of shuffle going on. I can see the validity of home-schooling or private schooling families requesting an allowance from local and state taxes where control of the costs and expenses for the vast majority of education resides. No nanny Federal Government for those who choose to do things their own way. And no Federal subsidy for their right to choose.	3172808	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

It takes a lot of determination and endurance to sit Junior down for two hours of lessons right after dinner. Further, as degrading as it may seem, schools provide an important function beyond education - as a day care service permitting both parents to be employed. As to the merits of giving tax breaks for home schooling, the public schools are not just going to disappear and their expenses have to be paid. Home schooling certainly means higher taxes.	3171944	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

Why shouldn't they receive a refund of the part of property taxes which goes toward local public schools, since they have neither contributed to the costs of operating those schools or derived benefits from them? Both private and home schooling are voluntary, and hence it is a choice that parents make to eschew the public school paid for by their taxes. Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay the additional amount for their decisions. If so, then childless taxpayers are entitled to similar benefits.	3171714	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

CMS	54	0	I currently have no children in the public schools yet I am taxed for them. Should I as a taxpayer get a subsidy because I do not make use of the public schools? No. If as a society we feel that public education is important and you as a parent want to make the choice to either homeschool your children or send them to private school that is your right. However, you do not have the right to take public funds to do that. This is just a backdoor way to say that vochers are ok and to undermine funding for public schools. Public schools have to take everyone and often for special needs children at great cost. Any attempt to divert dollars away from that public good should not even be considered.	3171704	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

If they do as well or better the families doing the home schooling should receive the same per day payment as the public schools receive for a student.

Lieve	8	0	As parents we moved to districts that had excellent public schools. Additionally we spent hours teaching our children to broaden their intellect, encourage their curiousity, and ensure their mastery of subjects. Just as our parents had done with us. We don't expect a tax credit for taking responsibility to educate our children. If citizens want to home school their children, then it is their choice. Rewarding this decision with financial incentives is not rational when there is a public option. If parents don't like the public education they have two choices, move to a better district or work hard to improve their local schools.	3175179	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

SA	24	0	The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen.	3174741	Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CET 2011	Do Home Schoolers Deserve a Tax Break?

JR	2	0	I have yet to meet more than a few people that enjoy working in open space arrangements. Incubators or work-spaces have open spaces because it is significantly cheaper than having private work areas, and typically charge a lot more for use of the private spaces. This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth. In a small group of people that know each other and have built trust it is invaluable. But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive. Having worked in a few offices with open spaces, I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten. Mr. Saval is 100% correct, workers understand their needs much better than executives. It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept. There's nothing knew about the idea of having an open space work arrangement. I think they used to call it a secretarial pool back in the day.	13863778	Tue Jan 20 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

me not frugal	10	0	Perhaps the workability of an open-office layout has to do with the age of the workers and the type of business. Workers who grew up with eyes pinned to computer screens have been trained -- conditioned -- to tune out the rest of the world. I once watched in awe while a young guy conducted a Skype meeting using two laptops in a crowded, noisy coffeehouse. He was oblivious to the chaos. Internet-focused businesses are staffed with -- and often led by -- just this type of person. Of course people like to have their own offices (status, privacy), but the question is whether having your desk in a communal setting adversly affects one's work production and workplace satisfaction. In some situations I think it does, and in some the communality is enhancing. I am old enough that it bothers me to have someone walk behind me and look over my shoulder at my screen. I need walls.	13845817	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

Michael	13	0	Reading the most popular comments, I have my own experience echoed. I have my own business in a cube in an incubator-type space in Manhattan to save on real estate costs. While it's big enough and the walls are 6 ft. high, it's still very hard to do any of my deep thinking/focused-task work there so I often wind up going back at night for several hours to get that type of work done. All it takes is one person with a loud voice to make it difficult to focus; with a few around me, it's impossible. I wonder daily if the money I save is worth it.	13848355	Fri Jan 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

Vipul Mehta	28	0	There are jobs that do no require concentration, focus, thought, or problem solving. Management is such a job. Marketing and sales is another. But for most everyone else open offices are the worst idea of all times. You will see that management will come up with such stupid ideas, and the marketing people will love it. The concept of thought is foreign to them, they think that the world goes around by everyone attending meetings all day. Again, worst idea of all times.	13846711	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

ks	58	0	Back in the day when I had my own office I could display artwork, plants, photos, and make my workspace an oasis where I enjoyed spending time. And I could welcome others in to share that space with me. The open plan destroyed individuality. It is DE-HUMANIZING. I now have no place to keep my possessions. Collaboration is DISCOURAGED because people can't sit comfortably together and talk for any length of time. In an open space, most people keep headphones on to shut out distractions. I find that when there are no walls, people build their own, just to keep sane.	13846636	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

joedonney	21	0	I'm in advertising. A writer and an art director (in the old world) are paired together to come up with creative ideas that neither might arrive at alone. It's an awkward dance between two minds. You have to make a fool of yourself, try out all the bad ideas first, give criticism, accept it. At times it means shouting, singing, cursing, ranting, and speaking every bawdy, politically-incorrect idea that crosses your mind. The process can not be done in public, in an open work area. It's too embarrassing. It involves trust in the person you're collaborating with not to repeat every stupid thing you uttered on the hard road to a good idea. An office needs to be designed based on the kind of work people are doing. Pity to anyone who needs to work on the phone in an open plan.	13845874	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

Charlies36	51	0	Having worked and managed people in both environments, its clear to me that any job that requires thought and/or concentration is better done in a private space.

That's what team meeting (formal or informal) are for.	13843343	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

Marx & Lennon	24	0	One of the first attempts at the open office was a design for SC Johnson by Frank Lloyd Wright, It was elegant and temporary.

My way to work and yours (any of you) is inherently different, so why should we all be placed in an environment that assumes otherwise.

rockyraccoon	37	0	I have worked in a variety of office environments since 1978. There is no question that the open office concept interferes with productivity for jobs that require concentration. I found it degrading to be put in a bullpen after having a windowless private office (which was also modular). There is nothing like shutting a door to say to people, don't bother me, I'm working. Movement and ambient noise are highly distracting. If you are visible, anyone can feel free to interrupt you. Over the years, the partitions got lower, more transparent, the spaces got smaller until finally, some employees don't have assigned spaces, they sign up for a space. This on top of stagnant wages for the middle class? It's insane. The real enemy to work productivity, in my view, is social media. Cut off the access to one's social media during the workday and you'd get a lot more accomplished.	13842842	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

Cristino Xirau	27	0	Personally I want a private office or work space with a door I can close. That's just me. If I could do without a telephone I think that would be heaven. An employees' cafeteria or lounge would be more than adequate to satisfy my social needs. Perhaps I feel this way because I was an only child and have always been content with my own company. I don't dislike company - I merely want to decide for myself when I want company and when I don't. I find most social situations a waste of my time. Why be bored to death at a party when there is a good book to read in the comfort of one's own home?	13842381	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

ondersna	31	0	This is hardly a 'first generation' problem. For jobs requiring quiet and deep immersion in thought, an open plan can be the kiss of death. Almost thirty years ago temporary removal of cubicle walls in my IT department created chaos. It sometimes takes quite a bit of time to mentally drill down to the core of a problem. The constant distractions, visual and aural, of a badly designed open plan can, in a moment, put you right back in square one. Repeat until end of day, every day, and see how productive you are.	13842094	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

Suzanne Wheat	6	0	In my first cubicle job, 2 people each shared a telephone that was in a hole between cubicles. A large room constructed of cinder blocks with linoleum square tiles on the floor was a zoo of ringing telephones, loud conversations and a constant stream of people walking to and fro. In my next job, I had my own private office. Hallelujah! There is no reason why workers have to be stuffed in sardine cans divided by partitions that block nothing. A windowless square is far superior to an open floor design.	13848393	Fri Jan 16 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

jimmyblueyes	2	0	"When hired as a Technical Writer at a famous movie studio, I notified the manager that ""writers work best when the loudest voice is the one in my head."" ""No problem,"" replied the boss. I'm seated with a dozen workers in an open-space environment with low partitions, lots of sunshine, ample alcoves and informal meeting spaces for on-the-fly discussions. Why does this work? Because the studio saved _even more_ money by eliminating . . . telephones! Gotta call your kid's school? Use your own cellphone and go find an alcove. Confidential news to share with the boss? Write an email, send an instant message, schedule a private conference room, or convene in the Commissary. Sounds repellent, but in truth, it works. Use your computer for communications. There's still a finite amount of space, so we can't shoehorn many more people into this environment without tipping the comfort level, the primary concern now."	13846630	Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CET 2015	Bring Back Cubicles?

I had a weekly routine. Sunday night 9PM you could login to a website and book a private study room. They ware small (about 50% larger than a broom closet) but they had a desk, a power outlet, a network jack and a DOOR. I was hitting refresh on my browser every Sunday starting 8:59 for four years straight. I know it's not socially acceptable. We're all supposed to love being the center of attention at the party but some of us are introverts and open floor plans will NEVER be comfortable and will NEVER be conducive to anything but misery.

Earthling	2	0	According to the Centers for Disease Control, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. The percentage of children aged 6-11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7% in 1980 to nearly 18% in 2012. Similarly, the percentage of adolescents aged 12-19 years who were obese increased from 5% to nearly 21% over the same period. Now, more than one-third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese. The obesity epidemic is linked to screen time, to kids sitting on their butts looking at screens all day, to the lack of outdoor activity and exercise. Mind and body are interactive systems and without a healthy body, there can be no healthy mind. How many yougn people these days are depressed, or hyperactive, or otherwise suffering from some mental disorder --- and how many would benefit from fresh air and exercise and time in the natural world? Mr. Bergman does not even begin to address childhood and adolescent obesity in his screed based only on personal anecdote.	15513413	Fri Jul 17 00:00:00 CEST 2015	Teens Hooked on Screens	Is Internet addiction a concern for teenagers?	/roomfordebate/2015/07/16/is-internet-addiction-a-health-threat-for-teenagers	Internet addiction is a concern for teenagers	Internet addiction is not a concern for teenagers	false	false	Internet addiction is a concern for teenagers
