12118409	Not a good idea because it would set a precedent to let the anti immigrant states write their own restrictive laws. that said at minimum New York should issue temporary special instate drivers licenses to non citizens so they legally drive and have the ability to purchase insurance.	This would allow anti-citizenship states write their own immigration laws.
12114985	So someone who is in this country illegally, ignores and disrespects our sovereignty and laws, does not have to show any knowledge or allegiance to our nation is going to vote for government officials? Worse, they are going to decide the fate of persons in criminal cases, a jury supposedly of our peers but instead decided on what, their culture or knowledge from a foreign land, often places that do not have our constitutional protections? Are these abdicates insane?	Illegal residents should not get citizenship because then they would be allowed to vote without proper knowledge.
12118061	This concept of allowing of states to grant citizenship is a really bad idea. While the idea of states granting citizenship has historical roots and may make North East and West Coast Blues States feel good the precedent has serious drawbacks. Does anyone for a minute believe that some of the more retrograde red states would not seize on the opportunity to make state citizenship far more restrictive in their bailiwicks. I can picture some of these states going back to the original definition "White Male Property Owners over 21 years of age" and probably add membership in a fundamentalist Protestant church as an enhancement. In short This is a really bad idea.	The idea of allowing states to grant citizenship may have historical roots, but it has serious drawbacks. If state citizenship were used to mitigate immigration issues, some state would be more restrictive. Some states might consider going back to a restricting citizenship to white property owners over the age of 21.
12118132	Hmmm... the States-Righters ought to love this, huh? It certainly has precedents and does not seem prima facie unconstitutional. After all, would not a lot of Texans, Alaskans, and others enjoy giving total fealty to their state and avoiding any responsibility to a larger polity? No? When enough people realize that immigration is driven by forces much stronger and more pervasive than domestic policy, that it cannot be eliminated by laws, fences, patrols, or any other local action, and that it will continue to be the boon for us that it has always been, perhaps then a rational discussion will ensue.	Immigration can't be eliminated to laws and fences and has always been a boon for us.
16312746	Determining entitlement to reparations would open major wounds in US society. The issue of the extent of racial mixing would have to be addressed -- a topic that the US (particularly the South, where it was rampant) finds extremely painful. Aside from permitting reparations for people who are obviously white, it would open a socially-divisive new polemic on determining who is white and who is black, based on genetics. As a society that is pretty much committed to allowing natural processes to make us, as individuals, as rainbow as we wish to be, reparations would be a terrible step backwards into social identifications based on race.	If so, then everyone would be forced to discuss their difficult past and racial mixing. It would be too racially based. Reparations would allow for continued discrimination based on race, rather than allowing people of all races to blend together.
16325513	As a student of history I have learned that it is not wise to apply the understandings, mores and concerns of one's own time and place to past generations. George Washington owned slaves and no one in his day thought him any the worse for it. Indeed, I dare say he would be hard pressed to understand, let alone consider, the arguments of anyone in today's world favoring reparations for what was a legal and acceptable practice in his day and age. People of every time and place should be seen in the terms of their own time and place - not ours. If history teaches us anythiing it might for us to examine the failures of the past and at least attempt not to repeat them in our present.	Being a student of history I have learned you cannot apply today's societal norms to the ones of past generations. History should be seen from the historic point of view - not ours.
16319702	If an individual or a group is managing their affairs poorly, chances are, it has nothing to do with the way their forebears were treated 150 years ago and beyond. I would suggest that they look in the mirror and recite a little Shakespeare: "to thine own self be true".	How forebears were treated 150 years ago shouldn't effect your state of being today. My suggestion is no reparations.
16318175	In 1860, the US Census reports that less than 2% of the census populations owned even one slave. Even in the Deep South, less than 4% of the population owned a slave. And, history shows that amongst the Southern slave owners were Blacks and African Americans. When one considers that most of the wealth generated by the industrial revolution occurred in the slave free North, it's hard to agree with the author's statement that "...much of the wealth enjoyed by" the US was gained through the slave trade. Overall, out of the 12-15 million Africans transported to the Americas, less than 4% ended up in British North America or the subsequent US. It would make as much sense for African Americans to seek reparations from the West African kingdoms that captured the slaves and sold them to European slavers.	Very few people actually owned slaves and most of them were African American. It is difficult to agree that wealth was gain through slave trade. Only 4% of the 12-15 million slaves ended up in the US. It would make sense for them to seek reparations from the West African kingdoms that captured the slaves, and sold them to European slavers.
16318006	The chief argument against slave reparations in the United States is that the descendants of Africans transported as slave to the present-day United States are much better off than the descendants of Africans whose ancestors were not enslaved and transported to the United States. Today, the average per-capital income in Sub-Sahara Africa is about $750 a year and the average life expectancy is about 50 years. Africans Americans are by far the world's most affluent large black population.	Many descendants of slaves are well off today.
16325283	Instead of reparations maybe the more wealthy and more developed countries could use provisions in their mutually beneficial trade pacts to help the sluggish economies of the Island Nations that were devastated by the slave trade and then abandoned. Documentation and periodic reviews might help identify the best of those policies and make adjustments for the good of all involved.	Rich countries could add provisions in their mutually beneficial trade pacts. Through thorough research, reparations could be possible.
16318425	As degrading and horrible as the act of human trafficking was during the transatlantic slave trade, nothing can be done to heal that wound. At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation?	Paying reparations to heal the wounds from the slave trade would be nearly impossible to do fairly and would not be effective in bridging the divide.
16317447	A note regarding reparations for slavery: The West African slave trade was driven largely by internecine tribal warfare, in the course of which captured soldiers and civilians would often be sold as human chattel. European countries, followed by their western colonies, profited from this trade for several hundred years....a blot on their history, no doubt. But when they discontinued their part in the trade, and actively (in the case of Britain) sought to suppress it, there was an angry reaction from the indigenous rulers of West Africa, because slavery was the mainstay of their economies. The trade continued unabated (if perhaps less lucratively), as slaves were sold to the North African and Arab states, right up to the 1960s. The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial. So if there is to be compensation, perhaps it should come first from Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and other West African countries....that is, from the descendants of those who sold so many of their so-called brothers and sisters into bondage, for as long as the rest of the world allowed it.	Much of the slave trade was driven by tribal warfare. West Africa was mad at the financial loss they suffered when the slave trade was discontinued. Slaves were sold to North Africa and Arabia through 1960. African kingdoms sold slaves in to slavery.
16314901	Blacks sold blacks into European/American slavery. The African tradition of slavery still persists in many parts of Africa. Mauritania leads with an estimated 10-20% of the population in slavery. Move on liberals ..... focus on today's slavery and the cultural issues that face Africa. How about focusing on today's sex slavery in the US in most major cities. Modern efforts to atone such as the Pigford Settlement are a total embarrassment and an under-reported scandal costing taxpayers $4-5 Billion. BTW - My family never owned slaves but a dozen of my family members fought in the civil War with two being killed, one in Savannah after the march to the sea and one on the second day of Gettysburg. Nobody paid my family any reparations. Move on!	Africans also participated in the slavery system. Slavery is still practiced in many parts of Africa. Today's sex slavery is an important issue that should be focused on. The Pigford Settlement was a scandal costing $4-5 billion. My family never owned slaves, but some family members fought in the Civil War, with two being killed. Families aren't paid reparations.
16157609	Thanks for this article. I have had the wonderful fortune to have spent a good part of my professional life interacting with deaf-blind children and adults. All that I have learned from interacting with them supports Matthew Hertenstein's thoughts here. Touch conveys SO much. People without vision and hearing are experts in reading subtleties of touch in others. I have had to learn (and am still learning) to speak their language, and in the process have come to understand and appreciate deeply what Matthew Hertenstein means when he says that, "Some people need other humans more than they think." Perhaps not only some people, but all people. Touching a screen is nothing like touching another human being.	People need other people more than they think. Treatment of depression and anxiety requires human contact, not just electronic interaction.
7385804	While reading Said's article, my thoughts on the need of professional critics was swayed. Valid points were made on the role of a professional critic, and the difference between them and amatuers in the theatre world. For the sake of the art it is necessary that the people critiquing it know exactly what they are talking about because there are a lot of little details that the average person with no theatre background wouldn't take into account. In some area's such as theatre, a professional critic is required.	Professionals critics are specifically trained their fields.
7367236	Najla Said states, "Criticism must be treated as a job that requires knowledge, skill and a certain degree of objectivity, like every other area of journalism." I only read professional critic reviews, due to their experience and Knowledge. I find the random outburst of amateur critics annoying and incredible. Without the professional viewpoints there will not be any stable viewpoints of entertainment to consider.	Criticism offers much to the industry and should be treated like other similar professions. Professional critics have experience and know what they are critiquing. We should always have professional viewpoints to consider.
7367053	At first the need for one person's opinion seemed unnecessary to me when we get so many for no cost but having critics is still very important in our lives; in the lives of the artist. To just the viewer it might not be so important for a professional critique but for the people behind the show it means a lot. Even if the critique isn't the most positive thing the artist still needs someone with experience to call them out on the things they might have not seen for themselves. Not just people that have time to post up ignorant comments.	We need professional critics in order to provide meaningful feedback to the people behind the show. Critiques are  needed to call them out on the things they might have not seen for themselves, even if the critique isn't the most positive thing.
7326661	As much as writers, directors and musicians may hate them, as much as the public may ignore them and as much as their craft wavers in the subjective. Critics - the good ones, educated and culturally matured - bring accountability and measurement to the arts. They save a reader a few bucks at the bookstore and theater, they also delineate borders between taste and the tasteless, separate writers such as Colum McCann from	Writers and other professionals may hate critics. Critics bring accountability and measurement to the arts. Professional critics can save customers money. They show us the difference between tasteful and tasteless.
7329563	Constructive, professional criticisms are a must. I, for one, never read reader reviews. I don't know them, their reputations, nor their philosophies. Just as I am a professional in my field (resume writing and career coaching), I appreciate the work of professionals who critique literature, theater, and movies.	We need constructive professional criticisms. Professional work is important.
7328014	In my experience, bloggers are much kinder to productions than professional critics because they want their reviews to be publicized and linked to by theaters (and they want to continue to get free tickets). It's understandable, but it isn't much much of a service for theatergoers.	Bloggers are not willing to be as critical as critics need to be and want their reviews publicized by those being reviewed in exchange for traffic and free tickets.
7327906	I've been a national critic of film, music, photography, books and cultural issues in general. I've always preferred the term "writer about . . ." to "critic" or "reviewer" (as in "writer about movies or "writer about dance"). A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of "criticism" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any "critic" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few. Unlike the casual opinionators who crowd the Internet, the best professional critics become longtime companions - passionate, prickly friends with whom one can agree, laugh and argue over many shared experiences.	Criticism is important not because of its opinion but because it applies context to a work. Professional critics shed light to things that would otherwise be missed, make people question things, and think harder about things. A professional critic becomes like an old friend.
13320024	These are good points, but I have to say that this was my philosophy for five years and then I realized that my hands-off approach had not met the needs of my child who would have benefited from more organizational support and parental involvement. Some children do need a parent or adult there to contain the frustration and model working habits.	My child would have benefited from more parental involvement. Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.
13321356	There is a difference between doing the homework for them and helping them understand the principles. A parent should never do the work for them, but should help with understanding when required. establishing good study habits and monitoring results. Our children were completely different in dealing with homework. Our son was a last minute kid and our daughter started as soon as she got the assignment. Both did very well in school and have successful careers. They were just different and our goal was to assure they got their work done and understood it.	There is a difference between doing the homework for them, versus helping them understand the principles. Parents should help their kids with homework so they can understand the work, and create good study habits.
13322086	I completely agree with the comments posted by Mike Melcher. Milner used this as an opportunity to push his upcoming book. Yes equality is a problem and has been a problem throughout human existence. He avoided the issue. All kids need to do homework. It is a simple way to see if your child is learning, if they sit down in front of an assignment and have no idea what to do, you as a parent need to be aware of that and help them learn. It's part of the job description, at least in my book. And if I can teach my kid more than someone else, well that's life. Someone will always have more and someone will always have less. I still need to do the best I can.	Parent should be aware of their kids doing homework and help them. Helping children with homework is part of parenting. I might teach my kids more than others.
13343210	I must say I beg to differ. I think parents should help with homework and I think homework is helpful. My daughter usually only has 1 page of math homework per night which I make sure she completes. I have her sit beside me to work on it and I help her as needed. The homework is tied to what they have done that day in math and I feel it reinforces the concept. I agree that children need time to play and relax but if they don't do any homework/extra academics outside of school hours, how are they going to be able to compete and excel at the college level? Kids can't suddenly be prepared for college when they are in 12th grade -- they need to start becoming academically disciplined in the elementary grades. I feel that my daughter does much better in school and has a much more positive attitude towards her studies than if I were not involved.	Children need to do homework outside of school hours so that they can prepare to excell at the college level. Kids do better in school when they do their homework without the help of their parents.
13319707	Yes, it is important for children to learn how to do their homework by themselves. However, reviewing assignments with them can often help them to see where they made mistakes or help them to clarify matters that they may not fully understand. If a child is able to feel comfortable discussing material with his or her parent, there is an opportunity to reinforce what the child is learning. These interactions can build self-confidence and help to develop critical thinking. Students who are in large classes rarely get the type of individual attention in a class that they may receive from an involved parent at home. Sometimes revisiting the material at home can present a child with the opportunity to understand more about it.	Parents should help with assignments to show children their mistakes or to clarify misunderstandings. When children discuss what they are learning with their parents, it helps to reinforce what they have learned. Participating in homework parents build self-confidence and help develop critical thinking. A parent at home can give more individual attention than can a  teacher of a large class. Going over material at home can help a child better understand it.
13319591	Since many teachers don't actually teach, are left by the administration to run a classroom any way they want to, since it is extremely rare for any public school to have a code of conduct for teachers, for instance that they grade homework in a timely manner and provide prompt feedback, parents must too often fill in and do the individualized teaching that their kids need, and are not getting at the school.	Parents often have to fill in the gaps since many teachers don't teach and there are no standards by which they are to run their classrooms.
13316560	I believe there are no hard rules regarding parental involvement with homework. What is being overlooked in this discussion is the insight parents can get into so many aspects of their child's development including: 1) Academic progress in different subjects 2) Developing interests in potential careers 3) Relationships with teachers and even school peers 4) Early warnings of problems in school or more personal issues. Hints about all these issues can be discerned by the parent who takes time to help their children with homework which can even be just a guise for LISTENING. Homework involvement was a great opportunity to learn how our kids were doing.	It can alert them to early signs of learning problems or personal issues they may  have. Helping children is a positive thing and parents can even use this as an opportunity to listen to their children,. Helping with homework helps parents see their children's academic progress.
6026123	Humans don't resemble vegetarian mammals (cows, sheep) any more than we resemble bears. We are primates, and our closest genetic relatives (chimps) are omnivores. What's more revelant is that our digestive systems are still we equipped for eating raw animal protein such as sushi, clams and oysters on the half-shell, and steak tartare. Don't try eating raw potatoes, beets, or beans though, they're all indigestible to us. Although cutting back on animal-based foods is certainly healthful, a purely vegan diet offers many challenges to be complete.	Humans are distinct from vegetarian animals such as cows, sheep or bears. We are made to be omnivores. Diigestive systems are able to digest raw foods such as sushi, clams, and oysters. It's good to eat less animal products, but being vegans is to hard to be a complete diet.
6024130	This argument is seriously flawed. What are this guy's qualifications? He's a chef, not an evolutionary biologist. Every living thing has evolved with certain traits that have enabled it to thrive. No, we may not have the speed and strength to kill a deer with our bare hands. But we have other evolutionary advantages that have enabled us to eat animals. Humans have been eating meat for millennia and our bodies have adapted to an omnivorous diet. If we weren't fit to eat animals we'd be extinct by now. Eating raw meat makes people sick because modern factory farming and slaughterhouse practices lead to contamination. It's also the modern industrial diet that has lead to our current health problems (diabetes, heart disease, etc.) If people ate the way they did a hundred years ago and earlier (including eating meat) we'd all be a lot healthier. It's not meat that's the problem.	A vegan diet goes against human evolution. If the human race did not eat animals we would have gone extinct. Meat is not the problem.
6016899	You're going to have a hard time eating (at least enjoying) a purely vegan diet without processing tools. Fruits, nuts, and raw vegetables all the time? No soy milk? No tofu? No vegetable oil? No corn or wheat flour? This person makes a completely specious argument.	Vegan diets are not enjoyable or easy to process.
6023656	I've been vegan for 20 years and I feel great. I supplement with B-12, Vitamin D and Flax Seed Oil for Omega 3's. I exercise daily and don't drink or smoke. As others have said, is the problem that my diet may lack animal flesh and a few easily replaced nutrients or that that so many carnivores eat way too much of both flesh and everything else? I	As a 20 year vegan I feel great.
6020609	Yes, quality does matter, but few people either have the time or money to seek out that quality. Going vegetarian makes it easier to avoid most all of the industrial animal products in our supermarkets. Maybe the meat producers will take heed if we start demanding more quality as consumers or just stop buying meat by the pallet. I, for one, can't bear the thought of a female pig in a gestation crate for all her adult life.	Yes because quality matters. Vegetarians  don't eat animal products. Meat producers will be required to demand higher quality.
6017246	Vegans are disproportionately female, white, liberal, highly educated, active, and wealthy. All six of these factors dramatically increase life expectancy. Moreover, vegans are especially careful about what they eat and pay much more attention to nutrition than ordinary Americans. They are far more likely to eat organic vegetables and far less likely to eat fries and hostess cupcakes. And then there's the fact that unhealthy lifestyles like smoking or veganism tend to lead to weight loss, which masks many of the health effects. If veganism had no health effects whatsoever, we would expect vegans to live much longer and be much, much healthier. The fact that vegans aren't healthier--and may even be significantly less healthy--means that veganism is probably a pretty unhealthy lifestyle.	Vegans are usually white, educated, liberal females. Veganism is an unhealthy lifestyle, like smoking, which leads to weight loss which has health benefits that mask the additional health problems caused by the lifestyle. Vegans do not live much longer or display much better health. Veganism is not a sound way for everyone to eat as some vegans are less healthy than their non-vegan counterparts.
6131389	I agree 100%. I believe everyone, not only babies or children, need a balanced healthy diet. Like the author states, our bodies are designed as omnivores. To go against nature is going against the unchangeable law. We cannot change how we are designed, or what we need to survive healthy. It is the way of life. Nothing artificial is ever an adequate substitution. The 'real deal' is much preferred, and in this case, much healthier.	Everyone, adults and children, need a healthy diet. Human bodies are designed as omnivores.
6129077	Veganism is for everyone. The age or body type of a person does not change the fact that all people need vitamins,proteins, and carbohydrates, which can all be obtained from plant sources. Nowadays, almost any grocery store offers vegan choices. There are also separate vitamin supplements available if needed, but most foods can be found with omega-3s, calcium, and zinc already added to them. Juices, along with meat and egg replacements are all healthy, vitamin-rich, vegan options. Helping the environment and gaining health benefits, such as a longer life span and a lower chance of heart disease come from becoming vegan. This article has been widely disputed below from lack of proof and false statements, and for a good reason. The author really should have done more research on the topic.	Vitamins, proteins, and carbohydrates are needed by all people, and they can be obtained from plant sources. Vegan options like juices and replacement items are enriched with vitamins. It helps the environment and extends the life span.
6102751	Even though I have to respect the reasoning to veganism, I do believe that there are definite risks involved. A diet based on plants does not provide a sufficient source of energy to the body. Without a source of protein or carbohydrate, the body tends to slow down and function slower. Facts are facts. All of them in the article stand firm. Babies need a variety of foods especially because it is critical in their development. As an adult you can make this decision for yourself, but think of your child who needs all the foods from the pyramid to grow and be the healthy individual you want them to be.	Vegan diets do not supply enough nutrients. The body does not function well without protein or carbs. Veganism is not for everyone, babies especially need food variety to further their development.
6074662	This lady's ignorance is profound. For instance, soy does not contain estrogen. The molecular structure of soy appears similar to estrogen, but it is NOT estrogen and the body doesn't treat it as such. This is a myth, perpetrated by the dairy industry for obvious reasons. I am a vegan, and both my children are vegans from the day they were born. This is anecdotal evidence, but they are both usually tall, strong, healthy. One is getting a Ph.d and the other had a perfect score on the army intelligence test; both are irritating know it alls, definitely playing with full decks.. Because they were raised with compassionate hearts, they are both the kindest and most thoughtful people I know. Both of them have thanked me and their father repeatedly for raising them vegetarians.	Although similar to estrogen, the molecular structure of soy is very different from estrogen, and is not used as a substitute. There are examples of kids who grew up as vegans who are now thriving in the world.
6042475	Ms Nina Planck ...stated Nature created humans as omnivores....which seem to be she has a direct connection to god but eventually its never true .. then let me tell why we called Human being the most intelligent creature on earth ??? because we can judge which is good for us with the sense of humor if this is not hold rue then we would rather called our self animals..Eating flesh is a not kind of human behavior because we lost our humanity and develop a attitude like animal.Animal do sex so do we however they do not know with whom they slept with on contrary we know.So vegan-ism diet which pure and lucid and it has many more advantage over non-veg-ism as so many has suggested. I am not a spiritual guru who talks about spirituality.But yes we can grow up our kid even with the veg intake that will lead his/her to be better and healthy person.	Eating meat is animistic and not right for humans. Many people have suggested the Vegan diet is pure and has more advantages over non-veganism. Vegetable intake will lead to a healthier person.
6025796	Just wanted to add that I went to a vegan dinner once in CA for people interested in joining the vegan lifestyle. The food was interesting and very chewy, to the point where my jaw hurt. The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy. I was mildly chastised by several members for wearing leather sandals and for having a leather bag. Leather is a no-no. My overall impression of the event and the people there was that it was like a zealous religious cult with very strict rules.	Veganism causes people to be very thin and look unhealthy. It seems that veganism is more like a cult than a viable way of life.
6025276	About B-12. My understanding is that normally, before people started eating so many dead animals, B-12 would come from the bacteria from the dirt on the raw vegetables that people would eat. Also, before we became so scrupulous about washing the dirt off plants before eating them. Also, before we started cooking all the life out of everything, including the nice healthy bacteria on the plants. Maybe also before we started pasteurizing so many things. Maybe the right probiotics would help. I went vegan a couple of years ago. It reversed my heart disease - no maybe.	Before people started eating so many dead animals, B-12 would come from the bacteria from the dirt on the raw vegetables that people would eat. Veganism reversed my heart disease a couple of years ago.
6027980	There is absolutly nothing wrong with a vegan diet in any of the stages of life, there are many cases of life long vegans from all over the world who are very healthy so i will rule out genetics and ancestry roots to what we can tolerate or not. the problem with why some people think it is inadequate is because they do not know what vegans can or cannot eat, and then there is a lot of misinformation from people that want to protect their own interest of meat eating telling others that it is dangerous! if you plan well your diet and know what you are eating then it is as simple as pie and anybody can benefit from a strict vegetrian diet. it is obvious that if all you eat is lettuce it can be very dangerous for you and most probably fatal, the same can be said if all you eat is red meat with red meat! however if you eat a wide variety of plant based foods your body can aquire all of the essential nutrients that it needs to thrive.	A Vegan diet is healthy for people of any age. A vegan diet is very healthy as evidenced by many older vegans with long and healthy lifespans. A vegan diet is simple and can benefit anyone. Eating a variety of plants can let a person gain essential nutrients.
6023354	This article is mainly about: (a) The health risks that the entire VEGAN population (both adults and children) face. (b) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGAN diet. (c) The health risks of feeding babies and children a VEGETARIAN diet. (d) The health risks that the entire VEGETARIAN population (both adults and children) face. The correct answer is (b). Some of these comments make wonder about the commenter's reading comprehension skills. Nina isn't saying that it's unhealthy to raise kids on a VEGETARIAN diet (i.e. one that includes eggs and dairy). Neither is she saying that adults should not be vegan due to health risks. She is saying that it's risky for BABIES AND CHILDREN to be fed a vegan diet. Why are so many people responding to this article with long-winded replies about how they became vegan as ADULTS and are enjoying the health benefits? And why are others citing healthy babies raised on VEGETARIAN food as a rebuttal to this article? What part of this do you not understand?!?!	Veganism is not good for everyone because it can pose health risks to babies and children.
6023192	My wife and I are long-time vegans raising a healthy vegan child. Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children. The considered opinion of such experts--and of our pediatrician--are what we rely on to make decisions about our child. We don't tend to factor in the opinions of cookbook writers.	Me and my wife and our child are healthy vegans. Our daughter was raised vegan and she is healthy. We know vegan children who are healthy and smart. Well-planned vegan diets are healhful for infants and children. Our pediatrician says veganism is safe and we trust his opinion to help raise our child.
6022867	I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.	Diet is particular to the individual, each person needs to decide what works best for them. Everyone has different dietary requirements and compelling others to try to live by vegan standards may not work well for them.
6022426	I have been vegan for 29 years, and i am fitter and healthier than any body that i know, most of all the meat eaters. the article seems flawed at most completely inaccurate, to say that a meat eater is going to be heather is laughable, as most are over weight or obese, have higher cholesterol levels and a multitude of diseases related to high fat levels in their diets. in short it was the best thing i could had done at age 19.	Eating as a vegan has made me more fit and healthy than other people I know. Meat eaters are less healthy and are susceptible to a number of diseases  related to high fat levels in their diets.
6022328	Go, Nina! After years as a vegan (and the dangerously low cholesterol levels that came with it), I couldn't agree more that humans are omnivores by design. No doubt many of us don't get enough veggies, but that's not justification for ignoring our ancestry and anatomy/physiology. As a Naturopathic Doctor with years of clinical and research experience, I have a sound understanding of human nutrition. The bottom line is that there exists no sound argument that humans are designed to be strict plant eaters. In fact, everything from our teeth to the other end of our digestive tract suggests that we are, and have always been, omnivores. If we were meant to be vegans, we would not need to supplement our diets with the various nutrients that a vegan diet is deficient in.	Humans are naturally omnivorous, as dictated by our physiological needs, and veganism is a health risk. I am a doctor with years of experience so I understand human nutrition. There are no sound arguments that show humans are designed to be strict plant eaters. All evidence supports that humans are omnivores. A vegan diet would not provide all the nutrients a human needs.
6020790	@Caren As a fellow Debater, I wanted to weigh in with my official health credentials. I listen to Nina about food as she is a wise woman and her promotion of real food is a wonderful and needed public health message, especially for developing brains. Real Food is brain food. She may not have official health credentials, but her advice above about what to feed babies is spot on.	A Vegan diet can be healthy for some but may not be healthy for everyone.
6019509	Dear Nina, with all due respect, one would wonder how the rest of the world survived tens of thousands of years, without the Western diet posited by you! It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world!	Vegan diets are rich in vitamins. Many other places in the world have traditions and knowledge founded in veganism.
6018664	Why do some people feel they must impose their lifestyle on others? Is it because they feel slighted by other people mocking their choices, or because they somehow have the what I do is better than what you do gene? The religious fanatics sound just like the people who push for one sort of eating behavior over others. Even Timothy o'Leary felt it was necessary to promote the benefits of LSD as a path to a better way of living. I am 80, still have all my faculties, omnivorous, obese, and lazy. Did outliving half the people who were born in 1932 come as a result of that? Or, more likly is it irrelevant. Maybe getting enough sleep was the factor, or walking everywhere as a teenager, or becoming an atheist after my Bar Mitzphah. Whatever. Oh, why does the Times feel it ingtelligent to publish B.S. like this? You eat what you want to eat, I'll eat what I want to eat and one of us will be in the ground before the other. And the planet will not know it, or even care.	This diet is not good for everyone and should not be imposed on others. Everyone dies regardless of whether or not they are vegan.
6018659	A great article. Many vegans may find themselves poised against it, but, beyond proving the scientific information in the article to be wrong, it will be very difficult to come to another conclusion than the author arrives at. Vegetarianism and veganism are mainly moralistic choices of life style, and should be presented as such. But somewhere along the way vegans decided to also try to make the argument that it's the healthier life choice, which is progressively being proven to be wrong. It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not the healthiest alternative only makes the moral choice more courageous. Nonetheless, I agree with the author that such decisions should not be imposed on children.	Veganism is a moral and personal choice and should not be a lifestyle forced on everyone. Vegans have argued that their personal choice is healthier which is being proven wrong. Veganism is a not healthy choice, though it is a moral one.
6017945	I admire vegans because they've chosen a challenging lifestyle requiring a lot of work, discipline and attention. I tried it briefly because I'm so repulsed by the idea of eating a dead animal. It's so primitive. But after a few weeks of veganism I craved dairy foods so much that I couldn't think straight. So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust.	Veganism is admirable because it takes dedication. I was a vegan for a while because it is primitive to eat a dead animal. I couldn't think straight without dairy products.
6017135	Awesome article! Children need animal products in their diet to thrive. Refer to Chris Kresser's " The healthy baby Code" for all the latest SCIENCE on the subject. This should be required reading for ALL prospective parents! Soy is NOT good for babies .. this is gone into extensively on "The Weston A Price Foundation" site. Keep up the good work Nina!	Children can't thrive as vegans and require a diet containing animal products. Vegans use pseudo-science  to pressure people into an unhealthy lifestyle. Soy is not good for babies according to The Weston A Price Foundation website.
6512073	Every kid is different. Some kids need to be protected from themselves. Some do not have the capacity at 13,14 or 15 to express what they are feeling, fearing, or if they are depressed. It is nice to believe you hold the moral high ground with respect to not snooping on your kids but it can be an empty and ultimately, to your child, a destructive gesture.	Snooping on your kids can be useless and found to be a destructive gesture.
6516554	As the 61 year old parent of two late 20 year olds I think all the helicopter parents here who think they can monitor their kids to the nth degree and not destroy the relationship are out of their minds. In particular "I have the gold I make the rules" is the relationship of master and servant. If you want your kids to quit school and be waitresses or bartenders to get you off their back keep repeating "i own you until you pay your own bills". If you want a lawyer, a Doctor an MBA or a Phd in the family you have to learn to respect their autonomy while still providing support. Respect for autonomy starts early and grows as the child grows. The years between 13 and 18 are critical. The child has to learn self control and you have to learn to let go and respect your childs autonomy. Otherwise there is an explosion when they hit 18	Overly monitoring children can damage the child-parent relationship. If you do not respect your child's choices while providing parental support then they will not be successful. It is important to respect autonomy between the years of 13 and 18. Children need to learn self control and parents need to respect their child's autonomy.
6511026	I thoroughly agree with Betsy Landers that "Parents who are monitoring their children's activities via technology are not crossing the line into invasion of privacy; they are cyber-savvy and involved." As the highly cyber-savvy father of two teenaged daughters who loathe any 'invasion into their privacy', I consider it my responsibility to help them keep themselves safe. I (thankfully) have limited control over what my daughters do when out of my sight. Were that not the case, they might never make enough mistakes to learn from and grow into adults. However, we know from psychology and medicine that human beings do not fully develop their 'executive functions' until well into their late teens or early twenties. As such, they remain vulnerable to predatory influences via cybernetic technology. Granting children untrammeled freedom in the cybernetic world represents, at least in my eyes, abrogating my responsibilities as my daughters' father. Someone's got to be the adult in the parent-child dynamic, and my kids, as wonderful as they are, are not 'it'. Mark Gary Blumenthal, MD, MPH Knoxville, TN	Parents who monitor their children's internet usage are smart and caring. Tracking kids keeps them safe. It's my job to keep my kids safe. Tracking keeps kids safe. I would not be a good father if I allowed my child to use the internet without monitoring them.
2851846	Marriage of William and Kate will work out because of the mother-in-law to be Camilla, who came into the royal family as a divorcee and middle aged. Camilla will have a sensitive feel to their situation and will be the strong defensive wall when pressures will be built up by the royal household on young Kate. Diana's marriage failed since it was a loveless marriage, given Charles' interest elsewhere. Kate and William go into the marriage deeply in love with each other.	Camilla will be sympathetic to Kate and help with the pressures of the royal household as they build up on her.
2854670	Just wish them both well and give them a fair chance. Princess Diana's verve and spirit made her a superstar, and she used her celebrity to do real good in the world. I hope this will happen with William and Kate as well.	Princess Diana was a celebrity and used if for good in the world.
2879751	Does a country that produced Sir Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, and Charles Darwin - to name a few - does the U.K. not have enough courage to recognize the monarchy for what it is? A sad, limp remnant of a bygone era? Modern descendants of thugs who engaged in slaughter, rape and pillage before anointing themselves 'kings' deserve no respect or adulation from modern day citizens of the U.K. Even if modern royalty is only nominal and symbolic, their very existence is quite harmful to the notion of an egalitarian, democratic society to which all civilized people aspire. Put them (members of the so-called 'royal' household) out to pasture. Kings and queens belong in story books, and history books. As individuals, they're probably nice people, but the institution of monarchy is quite a different matter.	After they are anointed King, everything changes.
2854900	'Normal' ? This royal marriage may well last (she's definitely got staying power), but how 'normal' the British royal family will truly become is anybody's guess. Prince William, for all his good qualities, didn't mix with a lot of 'normal', (i.e. unrich, unposh) people at Eton. He went to St. Andrews, noted for its posh student body, but didn't last a year in university residence there. He was living on a landowner's private estate (with Kate) within six months of starting at St. Andrews. It's taken him eight years to propose to a millionaire's daughter. How much exposure has he had to life in a less hierarchical society than the British armed forces ? Not a promising start, for anyone expected to move to a more Scandinavian-style monarchy.	Prince William is not familiar with normal people and has had very little experience mixing with the non-rich. The Royal couple have not been exposed to live in a less hierarchical society.
2852843	I think they can be quite normal..Prince Edward and Sophie lead a fairly normal life..although, of course, he is not in line for the throne. And Kate and William have known each other for 8 years..and there does not seem to be a "Camila" lurking in his background..with their life under a microscope, we would know! I just hope they can have some privacy. They have many, many mutual friends..so I imagine they will be surrounded by them..entertain them..and they will have their support and love them for who they are..and not because they are in the royal family. She is a lovely, lovely girl..and William has said "There is something special about her." Now this is nit- picking...but, she does look a little too thin. And I wish William was not a helicopter co-pilot..it is just too risky! Well..I wish them the best!	Prince Edward and Sophie are living examples that a royal family can lead a fairly normal life. Kate and William appear to have a normal, modern relationship that does not seem to be threatened by outsiders. They have lots of friends in common who will support and love them for who they are not for being royal.
2852454	It won't be easy due to over enthusiastic Photographers/Journalists and those who fabricate stories out of nowhere. Their privacy must be protected and ensured by media persons. They must not be haunted as has been witnessed in so many cases concerning Royal Linage. I wish them Good Luck & God Bless this couple.	The royal couple could be a modern family but photographers and journalists won't make it easy.
2850829	The whole media mess surrounding the royals is a consequence of the promotional fervor with which royal households (aka, public relations experts) developed stage-set performances for the public to devour. Prior to the Victorian era, those elaborate and lethally expensive weddings, coronations, and funerals - and the fairy tales that went along with them - just didn't exist.	The public are fascinated with all the news surrounding the royal family.
12538804	Agree with the general scope of what Mr. Ebeling outlines. However, Mr. Ebeling uses the qualifier "regardless of their income level." This is a weak link in the thrust of his piece. Many in the undeveloped world have no access to even basic computers (I'm not talking about cell phones), so the provision of 3D-manufactured medical devices would depend on the provider. And we know that bureaucracies do not give up their own jobs very easily.	Many in lesser developed areas have no access to computers, so the availability of 3D manufactured devices would depend on the provider. Bureaucracies are unlikely to willingly give up their jobs.
12538747	Spoken like an academic who never bothered dirtying his hands with what he is "researching": "My PhD thesis looks at the evolution of radical transparency mechanisms in terms of both media theory and the governing of democracies. It considers how networked media makes these patterns more complex for both institutions and publics." So disparaging a review of emerging digital technology from one engaged in such enlightened research? Unbecoming. 3-D printing technology is still new and like all technologies will evolve and improve. Remember cell phones 15 years ago? I think you've missed the mark entirely. While there are certainly limits, this technology holds far greater potential for reusing plastic waste in geographic areas desperately needing to turn trash into useful items. RepRaps in particular hold incredible potential.	3D printing technology will evolve and grow, just like cell phones have. RepRaps have a lot of potential.
12538582	Another high tech device to cause frustration and rising blood pressure. Another thing you've got to have. Imagine owing a 3-D printer and selecting a coffee table from Ikea. The program experiences a glitch and you get a toilet seat instead. This could be fun!	High tech devices only cause frustration. If the program experiences a glitch, you'll get a toilet seat instead.
12535548	No, it's not just that the corporations will have larger printers. It is that most of us will have various sizes of printers. IT's just what happened with computers. I was sold when some students from Equador showed me their easy to make, working, prosthetic arm. Cost to make, less than one hundred dollars.	Most consumers will have various sizes of 3-D printers.
12536410	This write up is enlightening and sensible, dispeling some popular misconception about the breath taking 3D printing technological revolution. Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster. Rival will creating market changing, disruptive innovations.	Economic growth needs innovation. It embraces state of the art capabilities. 3D printing allows for many innovations. 3D printing allows for low cost rapid prototypes and does not require high volumes as traditional manufacturing does. 3D printing will be one of the most innovative inventions throughout the next few decades. 3D printing has the power to change all industries.
12534617	I can see 3D printing for prototypes, and some custom work. However manufacturing industries use thousands of plastics and thousands of metal alloys, few of which can be printed. I don't see that there is going to be a wholesale conversion to this relatively slow, materials-inflexible process.	3D printing makes sense for custom work and to create prototypes, but not for everyday use. 3-D printing cannot use many of the raw materials presently used in manufacturing. 3-d printing is slow and inflexible with materials used.
16175182	>>It is imperative, however, that law schools not overreact to the bar exam decline by limiting access to legal education. Actually, what is imperative is that law schools not continue to admit people that are not prepared to pass the bar examination. The law schools have to reduce the number of law students to match the number of job openings. The only problem we have is that the law schools are a bit in decline and need to adjust the numbers and live with lower budges.	Too many lawyers are getting through law school and the can't find jobs.
16178496	If the ABA had its way I would not have a California license, having attended a working person's night school, Citrus Belt, now California Southern School of Law, operated by the Hon. Elwood Rich, Judge, Deceased. My class had a 69% first time pass rate in 1979, including myself. I was accepted at several ABA accredited schools, but they required I sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that I would not work while in law school. Since I had to work to afford the schools, I refused to sign and went to a non ABA accredited law school, where I worked full time, usually seven days a week. I have maintained a successful private practice ever since. To me, the purpose of the ABA and the testing board is to limit the number of licensed lawyers. In the 1960 and 1970s I recall the pass rate to often be below 50%. In any event, I think the test should be open to anyone wishing to take it, and I am against ABA requirements which limit the potential background of attorneys.	I attended a night school and if the ABA raised the bar I wouldn't have a California license. The bar is to limit the number of licenced lawyers. More people should be allowed into law school.
16175983	When the bar passage rate of ABA-approved law schools approaches 100%, then talk to me about eliminating the exam. If law graduates are as well-prepared as Dean Allard implies, then they should pass the bar exam with ease. The fact that so many don't pass demonstrates the continued need for the exam.	The bar passage rate should approach 100% before considering eliminating the exam. Well-prepared law graduates should pass the bar exam with ease. Because so many fail, the exam is obviously necessary.
16180428	Our son , already a member of the Florida Bar, was studying to take Massachusetts bar exam using materials from one of the more respected prep schools. I accepted his challenge to take the closed book exam and he was amazed when he graded my answer sheet and found that I scored with a high passing grade. Sure, I have an engineering degree and have spent many years in business and government but zero time in law school. My logic may be flawed, but I came away believing that law school is mostly a scheme to collect incredible amounts of money from students, their families and their futures to pay faculty members. This position is supported by practicing attorneys who want to create barriers and limit competition. The guild systems produced society's skilled craftsmen for centuries. Instead of the sterile halls of academe prospective lawyers should repair to the law offices of practicing attorneys. Abraham Lincoln never went to law schools. He simply read the law.	I took the bar exam with no help and scored a high passing grade. I left law school thinking it was a scheme to make money from students. I support the idea the bar is too low to get into law school. Lawyers should do more do more practical work rather than being isolated in academics.
16178304	The California Bar Exam is supposed to be one of the toughest, but it really wasn't all that difficult. The standard should be raised so that people who are not fit to be lawyers don't waste their time on a profession that will not be good for them or their clients.	The California Bar Exam isn't that difficult and it is said to be one of the toughest. The standard should be raised so that people who are not fit for the profession won't waste their time, nor the clients.
16177946	The bar exam serves now as the only bulwark against the declining standards resulting from too many law schools being far too eager to lower their admissions standards in pursuit of higher revenue from student tuition. This is solely a problem created by the law schools. Any potential consumer of legal services should hope that the bar exam standards are not lowered to allow less educated or capable candidates pass. A potential client may never know that their attorney took three or more tries to pass the exam. As a practicing attorney for the last 20 years, I can attest that the quality of new lawyers has been in steady decline for the last 8-10 years. Some that I have to interact with are completely unable to adequately represent their clients. Others seem driven to take any case (if contingent fee based) or drag it out as long as possible (if hourly) by maintaining untenable strategic positions in an attempt to keep up with their billable hours and, thereby, continue servicing their outrageous student loan debts. The degree of professionalism and competency in the legal field has been in free fall and I solely blame the law schools.	Law schools are passing too many students to increase revenue leaving only the bar exam to weed out those not suited to practice. As an attorney, I see a steady decline in lawyers' skills. Law schools today are turning out incompetent lawyers.
16176638	One of the biggest causes of the decline in the Bar pass rates is the spread of for-profit law schools. Their pass rates are always the lowest in the state and they have the highest default rate on loans. The most obvious first step is for the government to stop insuring any loans to for profit schools.	For profit law schools is responsible for the lowered bar exam expectations. In most states, they have the lowest number of passing students and often they suffer from having the highest number of students who go on to default on their loans.
16175689	If law schools were public elementary, middle, or secondary schools, someone would already be talking about closing or selling the ones that don't produce enough graduates who can pass the bar exam. In truth, many start out, but few arrive. Has anyone ever questioned whether the bar is too low for art or music school?	If law schools were public schools, they already be talking about closing or selling the ones that don't produce enough graduates, or who can pass the bar exam. Many students start law school but only a few o them finish. The bar is not too low for law school entry and it seems unlikely that others question the standards for art or music school.
16174773	When law schools became money machines, the quality of teaching and law schools in general plummeted. Students became consumers and classes became something They paid for and they expected good grades regardless of their commitment to the work or the quality of their results. Deans wanted monuments to their tenure....new buildings and more publication and students who were happy but not well trained. Believe me, I know. It's not the tests...	Law schools have become money machines with the quality of teaching plummeting. Students spending big money on law school feel they automatically deserve good grades as part of the bargain, despite questionable commitment and low quality work. Students got poor educations and the school got new buildings and the deans wanted something to show their tenure.
16183372	Law school is only a trade school, let's not get so grand about the quality of the students. To a large extent lawyers are a pimple on the backside of humanity; they produce little of value (while charging dearly), don't cure diseases nor build anything. I graduated from an Ivy League law school and am constantly finding better lawyers from ordinary schools because they have more practical experience.	Law school is a trade school that doesn't require a high bar. Practical experience gives lawyers from lower ranking schools a better shot.
16177998	The basis for this problem is that law school is a big money maker for the universities. Unlike medical school or grad school in the sciences and engineering, there are no expensive labs to maintain. Just a big lecture hall and an instructor. That has led to a proliferation of law schools and a decline in the average ability of those accepted to law school. My solution: Make the schools refund all tuition if the graduate doesn't pass the bar exam. They will then be more selective and do a better job of teaching.	It is too easy to get into law school because universities can make money off of students that are not suited to practice law. law schools only have lecture halls and instructors to fund no expensive labs to maintain. It shows in the ineptitude of those in law school.
3639835	The ideological undercurrent to this whole debate is whether or not we believe in the government enough to do its job. There should be no question that state institutions should be able to run publicly paid institutions that reflect the public's needs. Fiscal conservatives don't want to limit government, they just want to outsource it. The private sector is interested in profit. The public sector is interested in fulfilling the public's interest. Without it there is no government. There is only a shell whose surface is big smiling millionaires and high paid lobbyists who don't provide any service other than bureaucracy. Bring the idea of government back.	It is better for the economy to have workers work for the government. No question that state institutions should be able to run publicly paid institutions that the the public's needs. Fiscal conservatives don't want to limit government, they want to outsource it. The only interest of the private sector is the bottom line profits. Private companies do not hold public interest.
3639291	In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness?	When privatizers take over, workers nearly always lose pay, benefits, and services while owners rake in our tax money. Privatization allows companies like Halliburton to make a huge profit by outsourcing the labor and keeping the profits.
3638806	The same people pushing for privatization are the same ones who laid out the plans for Pinochet in Chile. Look what it did to their economy. The only way to fix the economy is eliminating NAFTA and bringing back Clinton era corporate taxes.	The people who want privatization do not have the cities and states best interests in mind.
3638542	We must all understand that when we privatize any industry that was once run by government it will, in the long-term, cost us more money, while taxpayers will have less oversight of those industries. Why? Because profit is added to the economic paradigm, (in lieu of non-profit management). Once a profit margin is figured into the economic model that was formerly a not-for-profit entity it will eventually cost us more. Plus, corporations have rights to privacy, so the public has little access to how their prisons, water treatment facilities, and the like are actually being run and managed.	In the long term, it will cost taxpayers more and lead to less oversight. Profit is added to the economic paradigm instead of non-profit management. A profit margin figured in to a model that was once not-for-profit will cost us more. Corporations are not held accountable to the public, even when they are providing public services.
3639142	Been there, done that, worked as a civil servant along side private contractors. Sadly, Nicole Gelinas has nailed it: it's no cure for the real proble: incompetent managers. And, surprise, surprise the managers always keep their jobs after private contractors displace the civil servants doing the grunt work. Somebody's got to mismanage all those contractors, right?	Privatization is not a cure for incompetent managers. Civil servant management will still be in place with privatization.
3639947	What isn't discussed in any of these articles is the fact that governments extend contracts not just for financial reasons or cost controls but also to allow certain 'disadvantaged' businesses such as small business, minority owned business and women owned business to gain contracts that they wouldn't have otherwise won. Whether this is deemed 'economic development' or interfering in market competition is a matter of opinion - I'm curious as to how these experts would evaluate that part of the equation.	Governments extend contracts for more reasons than only financial, but also to disadvantaged businesses.
3639803	It is important to recognize that if the infrastructure needed to supply that public good is privatized, then the that infrastructure owner has an effective barrier to entry and he can charge whatever he wants - well in excess of a publicly provided service. Keep the land fill, transfer stations, packer trucks etc in public hands. Bid out operations. Otherwise Tony Soprano takes over.	Privatization of public services will create a monopoly on public services that will in the end cost more.
3637150	Conservative members of the GOP are the foremost advocates of privatization. They also deplore government regulation. We saw the result during the Bush administration. Hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars were wasted on no-bid contracts uncompetitively awarded to corporations linked to Republicans including (especially) Vice President Dick Cheney. There was little to no oversight or accountability. Privatization is just another vehicle for exploitation of the middle class by the greedy rich.	The uber conservative republicans are the ones pushing privatization the most. Due to a lack of oversight billions of taxpayer dollars were awarded to corporations linked to republicans. Privatization is a way of exploiting the middle class.
6028049	Exxon provides a public good, too. Our economy would stop without gasoline and other petroleum products. What people object to about huge college endowments is the sense they are more about hoarding and bragging rights than providing scholarships. Harvard is holding $30 billion. That money could provide an education to tens of thousands of students at many universities, but instead serves as a line item in the US News ranking of colleges suggesting that Harvard provides a superior education because they have this hoard. States should require these institutions to spend more of their endowments on services or, if they can't, share the money with other colleges or the state.	Harvard is very wealthy and that money could provide education to thousands. Instead, it just serves to suggest that Harvard provides a superior education.
6033732	If we were to eliminate tax breaks to private colleges and universities there is no guarantee those funds would be directed to public schools. The whole argument is a red herring. The bottom line: Our schools need all the help they can get.	Funds generated from taxes on private colleges would not necessarily go to public schools.
6031972	The country is better off having two strong systems of higher education, publicly supported and private. Weakening one (under the unrealistic assumption that the monies fried up will be given to state institutions, and not the state Medicaid or roads program) is not a solution. The solution is what it has always been: wise and forward-thinking state legislators have generously funded public colleges.	The best plan is to have both private and public education systems. Public colleges are already funded.
6030836	Columbia College allowed me and countless other lower income students to study at one of the great universities of the world for almost no tuition. I graduated from Columbia with no student loans and this has allowed me to practice medicine in rural Upstate New York. I will always be grateful to Columbia and I will continue to contribute money toward their scholarship fund. Why would you want to damage a great university such as Columbia with a new tax policy? The money I contribute helps other students from lower income families attend this wonderful college.	Columbia College lets low income students attend for almost no tuition cost. Wealthy colleges deserve tax breaks and I personal contribute to a scholarship fund of a wealthy college. A new tax policy would damage wealthy colleges that deserve tax breaks.
6029168	"It makes little sense to single out universities from among philanthropies" Hear, hear! Tax them all. There is no excuse for the continuing charade of "nonprofit" status. Everyone should participate in the tax system, and the distortions of tax free status eliminated. The authors allege that not much money is at stake, but the fact is the Congress doesn't even calculate the forgone revenue from tax free endowments. The endowments have so much political muscle, they've been able to avoid the taint of "tax expenditure" for their investment income, keeping the issue off the Congressional radar.	Every organization should be taxed equally. Due to the taxes paid from investment income on endowments, the colleges have a lot of political muscle.
6029114	It's important to make sure that certain levels of financial support for students are met by universities to earn their not-for-profit status. Many universities are building empires at taxpayer expense - and it's a double whammy. Not only does the University itself enjoy not for profit status, but by expanding it is converting other tax-generating property into non-tax-paying property, diluting the tax rolls and forcing tax-payers to dig more deeply into our pockets.	The colleges need to see to financial support to students to keep non profit status. Universities are benefiting at the expense of taxpayers. The University already has a for profit status.
14370176	The same sex boarding school I attended in high school was a haven for racist misogynist adults to groom like minded adolescents. I have come to realize the absence of women in leadership or in the ranks had the effect of a compassion vacuum because everybody was supposed to be male mentality tough.	Lacking in women creates a different atmosphere that isn't always conductive.
14367579	Sweet Briar may not have a computer science major, but it is one of only two women's colleges that have an engineering degree. One of the things my sisters and I learned at Sweet Briar is how to use our voice. How to speak up and be confident. By knowing we could do that in a safe, nurturing environment, we knew we could do it in a hostile environment. I took 1 college course at a co-ed school. It was an education class that was about 2/3 women. Guess who did 75% of the talking? Guess whose opinion was validated by the professor and the TAs? Not the majority. Single-sex education (yes, I think men should have the single-sex opportunity too) may not be for everyone, but to argue that it is not a beneficial learning environment is uninformed and ignorant.	My sisters and I learned at Sweet Briar how to use our voice. To speak up and be confident Doing  it in a nurturing environment,  we knew we could do it in a hostile environment. Single-sex education may be beneficial to some.
14370545	As a feminist, and a mom of a boy and a girl, I want equal opportunity for both of them. I would love to find a college beyond Wabash that's all male. Because: on average boys are doing poorly in school compared with girls. It would be even better if that all-male school encouraged the arts--everything from fine arts to domestic arts, animal husbandry, and gardening, in addition to a rigorous curriculum of reading, writing, arithmetic, and science.	Same-sex colleges are still relevant because they can provide equal opportunity and I personally would like to find an all male college. Boys do worse in school than girls, so an all boys school with a specific curriculum would help.
14369245	Boys drop out of school at a much higher rate than girls. Boys and young men are 7 times more likely than girls and young women to commit suicide. Young men receive only 42% of college degrees, and the gap is increasing. Boys in school are much more likely to be forced to take Ritalin than girls, simply for acting like normally active boys. As we drop Phys Ed and recess, these numbers will increase. There are many all-women colleges, almost no all-men's colleges are left, because they've been forced to accept women. Why not the reverse?	Men drop out of school more than and are 7 times more likely to commit suicide than women. Boys are being forced to take more drugs for having the energy that boys have. As physicals activities in schools decrease and men only receiving 42% of degrees we will need same sex colleges.
14370228	There are no women only law schools. Womens' colleges, like Mills College, that do offer graduate degrees have co-ed graduate schools. The example of Hillary Clinton's success at Yale Law School either says nothing about womens' colleges or supports them.	In the law school field there are none that are for women only. Graduate degrees have the option of co-ed schools.
14369581	"The popular idea that single-sex education benefits women comes from anecdotes about female leaders who were educated in an era when elite colleges did not admit them. For example, Hillary Clinton attended Wellesley College ..." Hillary Rodham graduated from an elite undergraduate institution whose name is Wellesley College. She made a conscious choice to attend, and it is worth saying that at the time she matriculated at Wellesley, other schools did admit women - Penn, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, University of Chicago, just to name a few. "There is no data to support the myth that ... graduates [of single-sex colleges] are more likely to choose math-intensive career options." Where are the non-data that support this assertion? I was under the impression that the students at women's colleges major in STEM fields at rates markedly higher than women on coed campuses. What those majoring in STEM fields do career-wise after graduation is, naturally, another issue, particularly today, when students have so many more careers that their parents ever did.	They come from a time when educated females were rejected from top institutions.
14367936	As Native New Yorker said in those comments, there's room in the world for mixed and single-sex education. My experience has been that it's hard to know what a difference being in a same-sex classroom can make unless you've been there. I also know from my teaching experience that the males in a classroom need a different kind of learning space and shape than females often do, especially in the middle and high school years. They each get to the same place but often by different routes, and that's ok. It's not for everyone, but that's no reason to allow single-sex education to wither on the vine. It's relevant now, and will be in the future.	Both same-sex and mixed-sex colleges have roles to play. In middle and high school men need a different environment to learn in than girls. Single-sex education is not for everyone but it is still relevant.
14368424	Single sex colleges are a remnant of an elite world where female students were trained to be good wives for rich male students, not to become independent working women (as so many end up being anyway). I attended an exclusive, very expensive women's college yet there were men everywhere anyway (as boyfriends). If women plan on competing in the real working world they might as well get used to competing with men as soon as possible.	Single sex colleges are leftover from a time in which females were trained to be good wives, not working women. The real world combines both sexes, college is a good time to practice competing against the opposite sex.
14367986	Wanting to go to a single sex school is no different ultimately than wanting to go to a warm weather school or a school in the mountains or a snowy New England school. It is a landscape with a lot of valid choices. If you've ever visited Wellesley or Smith you will see an amazing learning environment in both locales. That schools struggle and go away is a natural thing: the landscape changes and the choices have increased dramatically. The idea that someone can state that single sex education is in any way bad is silly. It is not for everybody but please don't come up with theories to suggest it is not a choice for some: remember we've cultivated a pluralistic society where our wants and needs understandable differ.	Same sex schools offers a specific landscape. We have a society where our wants and needs differ.
14365749	There are powerful reasons for same sex schools to exist with relevancy just as there is a place for the dominate mixed sex schools. Each type of school bring a unique environment for a student, that can be advantageous to a certain student. Granted that there is so few single sex schools, strong schools with managed financials and endowments can succeed. I am surprised that Sweet Briar did not go coed to save itself or were unwilling to try - there may have been other factors (financial) that did not allow it to do so.	There are reasons that same sex schools are still relevant. There are unique things that take place in all college environments.
14367663	This is a very timely discussion for me. My own daughter is in high school (an all-girls Catholic high school) and I would very much like her to consider women's colleges as an option. I think they do foster women's leadership. I started looking around for academically rigorous Catholic women's colleges; the menu of options was very limited, so I expanded the search to include other women's schools as well. I can't help but think the tide will turn for these schools as professional women of my generation (I went to a girls HS, co-ed college and law school) look at colleges for their own daughters and see the potential in these schools for encouraging female leadership.	Colleges foster deep leadership skills in women. I believe that society will see that same sex schools encourage female leadership.
14367861	And yet not a single writer in this series notes a fundamental irony: Despite the declining number of young men and women who express interest in attending a single-sex college, thousands of these same women and men every year enter co-educational institutions, then immediately set about segregating themselves: from men- and women-only dorms to sports teams to fraternities and sororities. Let's not fool ourselves. The experience of higher education in this country is profoundly gendered, no matter how much some of these contributors would like us to believe otherwise.	Even in co-ed colleges women and men tend to segregate themselves often. College in this country is profoundly gendered.
16100791	This is someone who has never had a relationship with anyone. Ever stop to think that it isn't a good idea to make everyone the same? The differences are what makes life interesting. And there is frankly much more to my life than simply how I choose to earn my money. Where STEM is concerned there are alot of people , men and women who couldn't give a toss. It's not something that we see as worthwhile as a career.	Making fraternities and sororities into "one big family" on campus would be to make everyone in these groups the same, and that's a bad idea.
16102298	Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.	Instead, create privately owned groups. Making fraternities and sororities co-ed will cause the Greek system to go underground and will make existing problems worse.
16102556	I would offer the experience of my alma mater, Amherst College. When I was at Amherst (Class of 1961), the school was all male and had fraternities (I was a member of Chi Phi). When the college went coed, it required the fraternities to go coed as well. That did not go well at all, and the result was that Amherst abolished all fraternities. A better choice would have been to add sororities to campus life.	Historically, this has not gone well and in Amherst, all fraternities were abolished.
16104793	so the men think it should stay segregated, and the women argue for integration. Nice. It's clear to me that gender segregation is on it's way out, and men will just have to deal with it, but it seems they are not ready to accept that reality yet. Everyone is equal, everyone deserves the same opportunities, and the status quo is harmful to women in a myriad of ways.	Equality among the sexes is moving ahead and people will have to learn that this is simply how the world works right now. The sorority/fraternity system at present is harmful to women.
4794465	While do like the 99 cent rack on my kindle book store, there's a 50/50 chance that what I look at is self-published because before digital publishing, no one would touch it- and for good reason. A good amount of it is really really bad. So that said, publishers offer the value added-ness, if you will, but setting a standard that makes for an enjoyable read. I hope Amazon, if they decide to eat up the older publishers, hires those with generations of wisdom and allows those with it to exercise it in helping me make sure that my time spent reading is worth my while.	Self published books are of a lower quality than published books. Publisher offer known value.
4757953	Take it from a relatively new author, the present system sucks. First of all, it seems that most of the new books are by celebrity authors, many of which are just using their name to sell books and never wrote a word. Secondly, too many authors with great books are out in the cold since they cannot land a big time author. The system does not work very well for the readers. Go into a book store and look at the crap on display. Where do they find these books? With bookstore shelf space at a premium, I welcome anything that allows the little guy a chance. Besides, with e publishing, why do you need book stores? I like the feel of a book in my hands but at 25.00 it is too much. When the published gets 60% or more it makes no sense for anyone. Good going Amazon and best of luck!	Many top selling books are by celebrities who used ghost writers. Many great authors are unappreciated because their publishers cannot recruit a big name author. I appreciate the ways the little guys have a chance. It eliminates the need for bookstores. Physical books are too expensive.
4757099	How is bashing and belittling Amazon Publishing a debate? I fail to see anything more here than the usual 'let's smear Amazon because we must stay dogmatic about modern publishing.' Absolutely ridiculous. Referring to their editors as Chimpanzees is beyond low and trying to say that you're not is more than back-handed. And why must one automatically assume that they'll dominate the publishing industry -- especially if all they are interested in is widgets and algorithms? Inconsistent to say the least, especially if everyone else is so damn good. Seriously biased article and extremely flawed logic. If taking these kind of subtle but bratty gibes at Amazon makes someone feel better and gets them a few handshakes over their afternoon lunch in mid-town Manhattan, then I guess that's likely the real end result. Bashing someone for the sake of it is myopic at best and most reader's won't come away with anything but a negative point of view.	One cannot assume Amazon will dominate the publishing industry.
5061566	This is yet another reason why my e-book reader is a Barnes & Noble Nook rather than a Kindle. It isn't because the Nook is better (though it is, slightly), but because the Kindle forces you to buy e-books only from Amazon forever, and the Nook lets me buy books from Barnes & Noble and several other sources.	The Kindle requires you to buy ebooks only from Amazon, instead of other sources.
4759333	As a Creative director and published author I received 15% commission on every book sold and did quite well. Today I can publish my ebook myself and of course edit it after I write it and spell check it as well. Now I can earn 70% on every ebook sold. That allows me quite a bit of leeway in promoting my ebook. Tell me more why I should use an author agent who takes a commission and a publisher who makes a lot of money from my writing? By the way, they never gave authors extra money when they submitted the manuscript electronically saving publishers money by not having to enter text into a computer from typewritten pages-they kept the savings. Well one reason is I may miss the advance on signing most of my rights away on a contract.	I got 15% commission as creative director and published author. Amazon allows more leeway and money to the writers. Agents and publishers are not offering a good value for what they take.
4759126	Publishing and newspapers are old industries. Publishing has fed too long from the labors of writers and readers while too seldom adding true value. Newspapers have been lean and efficient, they juat aren't capable of satisfying the demand curve of today's public. Telecommunications and transportation behaved similarly to publishing and they underwent dramatic restructuring. The music production industry is well on its way toward completing a shake up. It isn't pretty, but it is too late for publishing to control their future. Ten years ago they might have had more of a say in the direction the sector is going; it is now pre-ordained.	Publishing is an old industry. Publishing has been sponging off of writers for long enough providing no true value. Newspapers are smaller and to the point because today's public isn't satisfied by them.
14105269	This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall. The system is patently unfair to condo owners, and this article is simply dishonest!	Condo owners pay a much higher tax rate than homeowners. Condos, because they are commercial properties, can be taxed at a higher rate, helping cities. The development of condos is increasing the efficiency of city services and conserving vital resources by replacing houses. Condo owners end up paying substantially higher taxes overall once their initial tax abatement wears off.
14102300	Of course tax breaks for the rich have hurt New York City--and perhaps the country. These tax breaks reveal the basis of inequality--subsidies for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. That many of the wealthy taking advantage of these policies are foreigners only adds to the problem. Everyone would gain from making these wealthy moochers pay their fair share.	New York City has seen how tax breaks for the more wealthy can hurt a city. This proves that the wealthy get special treatment at everyone else's expense.
14106155	That's great spin...to say that the taxes paid to the city from such buildings can pay for 'firefighters, cops and libraries' but of course as we all know there's no tit for tat on which taxes cover what social services. When it comes to developers, it's all pure greed for 99% of them. Most could care less about the masses.	Most developers care more about money than people.
14105461	Does the $57 million figure include the retail in the Time Warner Center which includes several dozen high-end stores and a handful of world-class restaurants? I suspect it does, and if so, then Mr. Spinola is being intentionally deceptive which as a corporate shill is essentially his job. One additional quibble: the ultra-luxury developers are NOT primarily building housing. They are building investment opportunities for the super rich-- many of whom will do no more than stop by their apartments from time to time. The very LEAST the city can do is tax these properties equitably so the city can get some reasonable benefit from the fact that so much available land is being developed for non-use and thus crowds out housing opportunities for people who actually want to LIVE in NYC.	Developers are not building housing as much as they are creating investment opportunities. Condo's should be taxed equitably because the land is being used and prevents other living opportunities for people who want to live in New York City.
14102517	I fail to see how its possible that a derelict site replaced by a building that pays double to triple the existing taxes at the beginning of the 421-a abatement....and then escalates over the next 10 years to much, much more.....and continues to pay FAR HIGHER real estate taxes forever once the abatement is expires.....doesn't benefit EVERYONE. Something is horribly wrong with this politically motivated mathematics. Everyone is outraged by the 421-a program at 157 West 57th Street and one could argue that its not fair that the "rich people' are getting this tax break: the opponents and critics never mention that on a $50 million apartment sale over $1.4 MILLION in transfer and mansion taxes are paid. If a building like this was not constructed, where exactly would the city generate these tax dollars from? What about this $ 1.4million in taxes collected from the sale alone doesn't benefit the public? What is government doing with the MASSIVE taxes they are collecting from these sales? Every time a building is constructed it creates a HUGE amount of tax revenue AND economic activity: why no mention of this? Barika, please tell the full story.	People are upset with rich people getting tax breaks but if a $50 million apartment is sold there are 1.4 million in taxes. Developing condominiums helps the city generate tax dollars which can then be used to the public's benefit. Without them  where would that money would not be there. New buildings generate tax revenue and economic activity.
16629308	This outrage at VW is misplaced for two reasons. First, because focus on VW takes the heat off polluters that matter. All the VWs diesels on the road combined put out less pollution than a single power plant. Second if something is worth regulating, it is worth effective enforcement. Enforcement via the honor system is no enforcement at all. When corporations are allowed to control the testing, it is downright silly to get outraged when discovering the results are rigged.	it would be worth it to enforce regulations. The honor system is not enough to enforce rules. If corporations are allowed to control testing, results can easily be rigged.
16625502	Regulation standards, and standards for policing them are two different things. The failure was not that we did not have clear air standards, it was that we relied to much on the companies to enforce them. It is not enough to tell aliens that can not simply cross our borders, or tell people not to take weapons on the planes. We need credible tests and policing on the government side. We check on the TSA and thus detect failures when dummy weapons are planted. We need to do the same diligence for other regulations like emission standards. It is not enough to rely on the honor system when it is not in an entities best interest to comply. John	Regulation standards and the standards for upholding them are different. Companies cannot be trusted to adhere to regulations. Credible testing and policing need to be in effect. If it isn't in a companies best interest, we cannot rely on them to be honest.
16620527	WHITHER VW So VW scammed the world and pumped out far more carbon emissions than it claimed due to software manipulation. Stock brokerage institutions have reportedly gamed their software to give themselves an insider's advantage on trades. Both clearly over the line, there seems to be lots of cheating going on. The violations are made possible by software designers who follow the instructions of their employers to design packages that will get them the profits they want. In the case of VW, by hook or by crook. Probably the same for software that games the stock market. Still, if human beings can design the software, then human beings can understand it and monitor it. That would require the government developing new agencies on the order of the NSA (or expanding the NSA) to deter, intercept and halt software that does illegal things. Can we do the job? Yes, with diligence and lots of legislation and funding. Will we get the job done? Considering the histrionics in response to the NSA, I've got serious doubts. But ya never know. Perhaps in Germany at VW on ground zero?	VolksWagen scammed us and created more carbon by cheating with software. Stock brokers get edges using software. Employers instruct software designers to design packages that will get them the profits they want.
16621641	Without government to ensure their behavior, companies will attempt to make a profit even to the DETRIMENT of the society that supports the business. We have seen this in the environment, in finances, in their treatment of workers and customers. Enough.	Government must regulate companies to ensure compliance. Companies want to make money even if it hurts those who support their business.
16621092	Marketplace regulation, or regulation by natural fallout of consequences in the marketplace, actually requires a company to victimize the public, before being caught out doing it. Certainly we can decide that some things the public can choose for themselves - unhealthy food, cars that chew up more gas for instance. But do we let the company take our money for a product that is not as advertised? Do we allow truck drivers to drive until they fall asleep at the wheel? Do we allow car manufacturers to produce cars that kill customers, and not require that they investigate and report on it? Do we allow companies to dump toxic metals in people's water supply? Do we allow companies to ship us salmonella and e coli as a matter of course? Or sell drugs that are untested? We regulate to protect people before they become victims, and to give people recourse once they are victimized. It is only common sense.	regulations require a company to cheat the public before they can be caught. Regulations are in place to protect people and give them options to fix the issues once they occur.
16633181	He seems not to understand or care about the damage done without accountability to the regulations, i.e. he's got the trust, but forgotten the verify. Without verification, regulations don't matter very much. With verification, inspection etc, you have something; without you'll just get cheating regardless of the regulations. What we need is more inspectors and independent verification regimes - funded by the industries involved.	Companies ought not be trusted because regulations that can't be enforced don't have much significance. If companies police themselves for standards they will cheat.
16630140	How silly. Adams ignores the reality that corporations are not actually real people; they are entities with a sole and simple goal: to make a profit. Real people at or near the top who attempt to bring honesty, fair play, or anything else other than profit will be passed up by real people with only one goal: to get to the top, by whatever means will bring the best profit for the next quarter. Without regulation from outside the entity, it's really a matter of time before disaster strikes. At which point real people get hurt, but often not including those who caused it nor the corporation itself.	Corporations have only one goal: to make a profit. The employees of a company that try to be fair will not progress, while those that only seek profit will reach the top. If companies are not watched then bad things will happen.
16628932	The idea that Mr. Adams supports--self-regulation by companies--is deeply flawed. While waiting for the markets to punish companies for bad behavior, many people are harmed. The harm can be both financial and physical. The lag time between the misdeed, the discovery, and the correction can be years. Many of the regulations we have in place are reactions to the failure of individuals and companies to behave in ethical and legal ways. Businesses fumbled away their opportunities for self regulation a long time ago. That said, businesses still have a right to participate in the writing of regulations, as do their customers and other stakeholders. Regulations are, by nature, burdensome. Often the weight of the burden is prompted by the serious nature of the original offense.	Companies will cause harm to individuals waiting for markets  to correct their actions. it can take years between when the violation happens to when it can be discovered and corrected within a company. Businesses have proven they cannot self regulate over time.
16628414	A fine notion, except for the fact that usually a great many people are harmed, financially and, in the case of product safety, physically, on the way to self-regulation through financial fall out. And what of products that only kill occasionally, at statistically low levels? Should predictable death rates be acceptable until and unless they rise to a volume that a law firm is willing to take on as a class action suit or that they break through to mass media coverage? Ian Adams' position is not only flawed, it is morally repugnant.	Many people are harmed financially and physically on the way to self regulation. Unless death rates rise to a certain level and potential law suits are attention-grabbing enough, law firms won't file class action suits against companies.
16629299	What nonsense, I suggest the author go to work in a steel mill, and tell us, he does not need safety laws and regulations. Over the years in several industries, I have had fellow workers that were killed, where the companies just sort of overlooked safety regulations.	Companies cheat regulations. Due to companies overlooking safety regulations I have seen people die.
16627411	The conclusion presented by Mr. Adams are not supported by the evidence. The recent economic meltdown, and the history of the tobacco, oil, and car companies (to name a few) show that large corporations are intrinsically unethical. Their objective is to make money, and other considerations are secondary. They are driven to regulate themselves only by the fear of economic sanctions brought by strong regulations - as Mr. Adams seems to admit. I would ask Mr. Adams to consider, for example, if industries would have self regulated to reduce acid rain producing emissions in the absence of a strong regulatory regime. Would coal mine operators self regulate to improve safety standards? I could go on with dozens of well documented examples. I invite Mr. Adams to visit several industrialized countries with weak regulations and see the effects of the philosophy that he proposes on the environment and living standards. Fundamentally, the only connection between Mr. Adams governance prescriptions and the real world is that, when implemented, they hurt real people. G.	The economic meltdown and history of companies show that companies are unethical and only are out for themselves.
16626960	full disclosure: I own a Jetta TDI that aside, I can go along with the premise that our business environment is already heavily regulated--I live and die with building codes and construction permitting officials. and I would agree with the assertion that another telephone book's worth of regs would not have deterred VW's deliberate and diabolical circumvention of well established regs. I could also go along with industry having a very important voice in the framing of regulations. But where, Mr Adams--where, pray tell, does it follow that "businesses are...best equipped to regulate themselves?" Your syllogism is lacking a critical premise.	I agree that a lot more regulations wouldn't have stopped Volkswagen from circumventing current regulations. Businesses are not best equipped to regulate themselves.
16626629	No, the last thing that this country needs is not more regulation. Quite the contrary. Whether VW, mortgage lenders, agribusiness, our business leaders have not hesitated to maximize their profits at the expense of their workers, their neighbors, their customers. I wouldn't mind voluntary good conduct by the business community, but, until then, Regulate! Regulate! Regulate!	Businesses value the bottom line profits over anything else.
16625746	No! Never! Corporations cannot and must not be trusted to regulate themselves. They would make lying, cheating, stealing, pollution and indifference to the safety of others standard business practices in the name of competition. What they want is to be excepted from moral and ethical standards that the rest of us must adhere to in order to have a functioning society.	Companies cannot be trusted to self-regulate. Companies resort to unfair, unsafe practices in order to turn profits. Companies want to be held to more lose standards than the average citizen.
16625226	Less regulation might be feasible IF we had effective means for using civil law to receive just compensation for the harm that is caused by faulty products. Unfortunately, conservative judges and law makers dedicated to protecting their business patrons have succeeded in emasculating our ability to use civil law for relief. Recent NYT articles have revealed how business has been using arbitration to avoid be sued. Wise law makers and judges work to protect the public from harm, but it seems that wisdom is lacking in far too many current law makers and judges. Greed is winning!	We need effective ways to hold companies accountable for harm caused by faulty products. Conservative judges and lawmakers prevent the government from regulating business. Businesses find loopholes in laws. Law makers lack the wisdom to protect the public from predatory companies.
16624526	Based on his picture, I will give Ian Adams the benefit of the doubt and figure he is just too young to understand how corporations work. Corporations race to the bottom in competitive behavior, justify all law-breaking and law-bending by saying that is their duty to their shareholders, and treat any financial penalties as the cost of doing business (most penalties are less than the ill-gained profits). What we need is tougher regulation (working to avoid regulatory capture by those who are to be regulated) and tough jail penalties for corporate officers.	Companies break the law and chalk it up as their duty to their shareholders and consider any financial penalties as part of business costs.
16623737	Yes, there is such a thingas as regulatory capture - companies find ways to manipulate rule-making bodies for their advantage to to keep out competitors. Without the existence of such rule-making bodies, they can't be captured - so companies find other ways to keep out competition. those ways are not perfect, of course, but then, comapnies are not always perfectly successful at regulatory capture. As usual as strict adherence to principle, whether libertarian or statist, is not effective in reality.	Companies use lawmakers to stifle competition and bend rules. Companies will use any means necessary to be competitive. Companies can't be trusted be adhering to principles doesn't necessarily work out in reality.
16622934	Thank goodness that this newspaper can showcase the ethical and economic agendas of such lobbying organizations. If we didn't see such nutty statements as Adams emits, we would be less alert to the clear danger of letting anarchist political interest ruin our country. Folks, there are sociopathic forces that would, for corporate interest cloaked in the word liberty, dismantle the American experiment. We have, and can, do much better.	Lobbying organizations have their own ethical and economic agendas. Companies will infringe on the liberties of Americans if left unchecked.
16622833	We heard the same refrain during the run-up to the housing crash. Fed Chair Alan Greenspan claimed businessmen would regulate themselves. They would look at the long-term risks of originating mortgages without due diligence and refuse. We know how that turned out. Even Greenspan later admitted he was wrong, that business cares only about the next quarter and doesn't care how to get there. Sorry, the markets have spoken. Business cannot be trusted, no matter how much hot air their lobbyists spout. Regulation is absolutely necessary.	They ignored the ramifications some of the mortgages they offered. Business cares only about the next quarter, it doesn't care how it gets there. Greenspan even admitted later he was wrong. The markets have spoken, sorry. Businesses can not be trusted not to cheat, even ones that seem to be trustworthy.
16621616	The mandate of private corporations is to make a profit. And if the profit is made at the EXPENSE of the society that allow the corporation to exist, well, too bad. Oil companies foul the environment. Financial companies drive the economy into the Great Recession. Airlines have no regard for the people they transport. As long as they make a profit, they are allowed to abuse the public until they are stopped. That is the way it has been since Swift and Armour canned and sold rotten meat and Carnegie sent Pinkertons to shoot striking miners.	Companies will lie in order to turn a profit, even at a cost to society, a fact proven by oil companies consistently causing environmental damage. If a company is profitable it is acceptable to abuse the public.
16621993	I haven't heard any serious call for more regulation of the emissions problem, All I hear is a call to make it harder for companies to cheat by improving testing of vehicles. This is not additional regulation. The author in using a massive cheating scandal to diminish the role of regulation is again promoting the small government agenda. This scandal is proof that government regulation and testing is essential. Without it this fraud would never have been detected.	Haven't heard any serious call for more regulation of emissions. All I hear is a call to make it harder for companies to cheat,by improving testing of vehicles. If there were no government regulations and testing the Volkswagen scandal wouldn't have been detected.
16621084	Right. HSBC gets into the business of laundering money for Mexican drug cartels. They know they are in that business from the start. Over the course of a few years they make 8 billion dollars *profit* laundering money for Mexican drug cartels. They admit guilt. They are fined 4 billion dollars. Exactly what incentive do they have to stop? They *made* 4 billion in profits doing the crime and paying the fine. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to sell-regulate. They'd make twice as much money!	HSBC has been laundering drug cartel money knowingly from the start. Companies laundered drug cartel money and made 8 billion and were only fined 4 billion for this when they admitted they were guilty. There is no incentive for companies to stop dangerous practices. Companies don't mind paying the fines if they make profit.
16620981	If there will always be ways to cheat than perhaps the regulations and laws should be about outcomes, not about methods. Suppose instead of a regulation describing a testing station the law said that if a car exceeded the pollution standards the manufacturer would have to refund the full original retail price of all units of that model car (including sales tax) and pay a fine for all the miles driven. Then all the mechanisms in the world for cheating wouldn't matter; just getting caught once would be the end of the corporation. Inventions guarantee that methods will change but the outcome is the outcome.	It would be more beneficial to create laws that focus more on outcomes than how they were achieved.
16620855	The problem with this philosophy is that a lot of innocent people get hurt when self-regulation fails. People who own VWs may see declines in the value of their cars. Workers at VW may lose their jobs. The car dealers who sell VWs will experience declining sales. Stockholders may end up losing more than they ever gained from the fraud. Competitors who did not flout the rules have already suffered. There is also the possibility that VW as a corporation won't, in the end, have to pay for their behavior. Without the threat of punishment for failing to comply with regulations, what is the recourse for society? It's the air quality that affects everyone that was damaged.	Companies cannot be trusted and even if they are caught like VW it is unlikely they will pay for their actions.
16621568	Regulation of corporations has been subverted by corporations. States that incorporate corporations are not equipped to regulate corporations that are rich enough to influence elections, are rich enough to muster a legal team that can bankrupt the state. Money from corporations and their principals cannot be permitted in the political process if democracy is to survive.	Corporations have subverted the regulations that should bind them. Corporations involved with the state have too much influence on elections. Money can corporations can influence the democratic process.
19716828	The question was: Is the world becoming safer? I grew up in a time of air raid drills and ducking-and-covering under my desk at school. A time of the Missiles of October, when the whole world held its breath to see whether the Russian fleet would turn from the blockade. We may have small scale conflict around the world, but we don't have children hiding under their desks anymore, or wondering whether that siren they hear means Russian bombers are on the way.	When I was going up there were air raid drills. I remember when we did drills for nuclear strikes at schools when I was younger. Despite small scale conflict, children no longer have to hide under their desks or wonder whether a siren means bombers are on the way.
8390305	I agree with some of the comments about not pushing kids too young to read and write. However, kids benefit from a preschool environment even if it is all play based. New Zealand has a free preschool program, but the kids don't start learning to read until they enter elementary school and NZ has one of the highest literacy rates in the world. It also benefits those who are in the lower middle class and don't qualify for free programs. This is where we really need to start making a push. So that their kids don't end up in the lower class.	Even if there is no instruction preschool helps children mature. There could be a strong correlation between pre-school and high literacy rates in New Zealand. These preschools will benefit the lower middle class too who do not get free childcare programs, so their children won't be left out and fall behind.
8389640	The problems with universal pre-school are the unstated objectives of the program. First, most people are sympathetic when children have parents who can't or won't care for them, but the objective of the program is to get women in the workforce - out of the home. This applies even when they can stay home or want to stay home. Secondly, the responsibility of child care and education belongs to the government, with parents assisting only. I would hate to see a society where all of our decisions belong to the government and parents and families have only a secondary role. A sad future that far too many people blindly accept and embrace.	The objective is to get women into the workforce instead of caring for children. This will cause more government interference in peoples lives relegating parents to a secondary role.
8389228	Since the creation of the Dept. of Education, billions of dollars have been spent to improve public education. Spending per student continues to increase while student performance has been flat, or by some measures, has decreased. With this record, can anyone justify universal pre-school? Brick and mortar schools are becoming dinosaurs. Charter schools, home-schooling and approaches are being chosen by many families who see public schools as inadequate, and public school teachers as captives of the politics of the teacher's unions. With this trend, can anyone justify expanding public educaiton to include 4 and 5 year olds?	The Department of Education has spent billions of dollar to improve public education. Universal pre-school is unjustifiable considering the current trend of cost increasing while performance is flat or decreasing. Public schools are becoming obsolete, many families are choosing home-schooling and charter schools instead.
8385921	But what happens if the preschool standards include socialization skill development such as turn taking, perseverance, self-regulation through movement and meditation, and other techniques? Also, parents don't always make the best choice for their children. They can be strongly influenced by family and cultural norms, and be in denial of their children's developmental delays. Choice sounds wonderful--who wouldn't want more choice?--but when those choices are based in emotional reasoning and not logic and sound social science, choice can make parents feel good but rob children of what they need. Maybe we need better education of parents as part of the preschool model. Teachers and day care providers can be taught the skills for providing parental education and even breaking through denial to some degree.	Preschools teach important skills such a taking turns, movement, and mediatation. It reduces the chances of bad decisions made by parents. Teachers and daycare workers can help break through problems caused by parents ignorance.
8385486	Head Start can evolve into a high quality early childhood education program but the first step involves transferring the administration of the program to the states along with performance standards. The current loosely administered federal model is not working well.	Preschool can provide substantial early childhood education.
8391093	It seems to me that comparing universal pre-K to universal kindergarten is apples to oranges. What makes pre-K so important is the teaching of so-called soft skills not offered in kindergarten or beyond. No amount of additional kindergarten is going to offer the valuable intensive lessons in curiosity and exposure to new experiences. Advocates of pre-K aren't simply asking to extend traditional K-12 education by one year, they instead want to give all children the opportunity to learn the non academic skills needed for future success.	Pre-K is important because of the teaching of soft skills. It gives all children a head start on non-academic skills.
8390396	There is a similar system in the UK. All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st. As my son's birthday is in October, this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment (unless we decide to put him preschool of course). Why not lower the kindergarten age by a year instead of starting a preschool program? The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning, the better.	Public preschool is a smart investment as there is a successful system for preschool in the UK. Preschool will help children transition into regular schooling. It's better to start learning to be in a group and learn earlier.
8386236	If only the United States would look to this model in Sweden. I have paid so greatly in terms of money for childcare for my three children throughout the years. I estimate it to be greater than $140,000.00, and it was never enough to benefit me when filing tax returns. It was a minimum of $600.00 per month for one child, at 40 hours per week. When I scaled back to 16 hours a week after my third childs birth, my take home pay was one dollar per hour. This was due to the cost of healthcare premiums and childcare cost. The ray of sunshine in this was that the childcare center was onsite in the hospital where I worked, and this allowed me to nurse my son on demand, and return to my desk without disruption.	Daycare has cost me a lot of money for my three children. Childcare costs are very expensive, as a part time employee, I saw my wages go to about $1 per hour after childcare and healthcare costs.
11318135	Writing can be taught and writing can be assessed. But why are we having this discussion about writing? Why all this talk about how young people can't write? Business leaders want good writers. Yet, teaching writing is considered "the lowest of the low" -- in higher education. Poorly paid adjuncts teach first year composition courses. Writing Centers employ even worse paid tutors (just a little more than minimum wage). So, do we really want good writers -- or don't we?	Writing can be taught and assessed.
11320634	Removing the essay section from the SATs sends a terrible message to high school students: writing is not that important. If it were, then we'd test for it and an essay would be required. As a communication consultant to Fortune 500 companies, I see everyday executives who can express themselves in writing. I also see those who struggle to get coherent thoughts on a page. Guess what? Those who write well tend to be the more successful business leaders. The message the SATs should send is to tell students that the ability to construct a coherent and supported paragraph or short essay is critical to business success. Unless you want to be a tradesman, writing will probably have a place in your career. Message to SAT: bring the essay back! Loraine Antrim	Removing the essay portion of the SAT sends a message that writing is not a valuable skill. As a consultant to Fortune 500 companies, everyday I see  executives who can express themselves in writing. Writing can be assessed with style guidelines and should be an included section for evaluating students on the SAT exam. Being able to construct a coherent paragraph or essay is vital to success in business. Writing will have a place in the careers of most people.
11318438	How many of us as high school seniors had to write a weekly English essay? From whom did we learn how to compose a well constructed essay? Isn't the art of readable writing (thank you, Rudolf Flesch) worth mastering solely to satisfy one's own sense of competency as a human being?	Legible handwriting is worth practicing to increase one's competency.
7010246	I absolutely agree with this article. The Teach for America program needs to have their teachers in the classroom a whole lot longer than two years in order to make a critical difference. Without longer teaching commitments, teachers in the Teach For America program will not be able to improve their skills and children will continue to suffer the consequences. Would a five year Teach for America commitment change things?...I believe that's a start.	Teachers need to be in a classroom for longer than two years to make a critical difference. TFA teachers never gain enough experience to be helpful.
10344127	Citizens should absolutely be able to record police activity if they're not obstructing officers from lawful action, and this right should be explicitly codified. The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty. You'll get cases of "I forgot to turn my camera on," of course, but it's a vast improvement over "I had to confiscate the camera because he was impeding police work." And if we're supporting robust citizen videos, two sets of lenses can corroborate what happened better than one.	There will always be a recording if the process is done correctly.
10336993	I hope we all agree with these arguments. Firstly, The State should never have any right to make a record of events that is denied to citizens. Secondly, we must protect against aggregation of data by the State. They will use it to prospect for suspects and potential offenders by employing analytics on masses of information; use would not be limited to single case or incidents.	The state should not have a right to make record of events that is denied to the citizens. The state will use this data to the disadvantage of suspects and potential offenders. Police officers ought not be required to wear cameras as the use could not be contained to a specific case or incident.
10346152	I strongly believe that cameras should be monitoring police officers 24/7. Every day police officers take advantage of their authority and act in ways which they would not act if they were on camera. On the other side, having a camera constantly monitoring officers would also protect them from citizens and the video footage would be able to be used as proof if needed in law suit cases. Cameras would benefit both the citizens from the police officers and the police officers from the citizens.	Cameras should monitor police officers 24/7. Police wouldn't take advantage of their authority if they were recorded. It would protect them and be useful in legal cases. Cameras would benefit everyone.
10338783	I don't think it would be a bad thing for the coppers to have cameras, as long as we the civilians could have cameras as well. After all, it is rather well documented that police, occasionally, do take advantage of a situation, and find a way to falsify evidence, or make it go away. Good for the goose, good for the gander.	Police officers are occasionally untruthful or falsify evidence.
10338469	Why not? This protects both the officer and the civilian and it keeps things transparent. Then it would not be simply a matter of opinion when things go awry. It will be on videotape. BUT how much will it cost to store all this data and for how long? Hmmm...	I don't see a reason why they shouldn't. It can have benefits for both the civilians and the officers. Then there would be evidence instead of just opinion.
10337570	I know that in today's atmosphere, I would never be a school teacher, scout leader, or Sunday school teacher without a Digital Video Record of my every encounter with children. I suspect some police officers feel the same qualms dealing with the public.	Police officers also want to be filmed.
10340252	One of my best friends is a Chief of Police in a small suburb of a big city. Although he initially opposed police wearing cameras, after the policy was in effect for a while, he changed his mind. He says that his biggest problem with young offices is that they overstep their authority, and the cameras help reign in these overzealous officers. In addition, when detainees complain about the conduct of an officer, he can check the recording of the arrest. Most of these complaints are without merit. So, it sounds to me that there is a benefit to the police and society by using the cameras. As far as privacy considerations, the cameras are being used in a public space, so I do not see this as a problem. (I am a member of the ACLU.)	Young officers often overstep their authority, and cameras would help rein this in. Cameras could help when there are complaints about officers. There are cameras in public places so privacy should not be problem.
10338269	Indisputable evidence of an interaction using an honest, accurate, unbiased recording does seem preferable to recollection after the fact and conflicting accounts. As far as first amendment rights, we are recorded and monitored daily by security cameras, cell phone usage, purchases. It could help clean up police misconduct and lead to swift, accurate justice for those committing a crime and be useful as a teaching tool.	An unbiased record of all incidents will sidestep the problem of contradictory claims and the uncertainty of human memory. Police wearing cameras would improve police behavior, and could also be used as a teaching tool.
5449542	Separating internships as a special class of poorly paid work seems almost pointless. If MacDonald's can't employ a cashier who's willing to work for less than minimum wage (or for free), why can ABC do it for an intern? The only reason for an exception would be if the intern is there for true training purposes and not for the employer's immediate benefit. Clearly, most interns are there to supply grunt labor, whether or not they actually get a chance to show their stuff. Also, the kind of large corporations who hire rafts of interns can certainly afford to pay them minimum wage to escape all legal scrutiny. These firms could still take comfort in knowing that minimum wage isn't nearly enough to live on.	Internships should be treated like all other work. No industry should be allowed to not pay workers, no matter how prestigious. They are doing grunt labor, even if it means being able to grow their skills. The kinds of companies that hire interns can afford to pay them.
5449342	Only someone from a well-off family can afford to work for no pay. These unpaid internships harm the cause of social mobility. Social mobility is what keeps democracy and America strong. The possibility of forward movement what keeps Americans invested in the American dream. So I'm really against these internships in general. I applaud any means of preventing the already-rich from colonizing all the good careers in this country.	Only those who are well off can afford to work without pay. Social mobility is stifled by unpaid internships. Students should earn a wage for their hard work.
5447502	"The lawsuit against Hearst claims that unpaid internships exacerbate class divisions, because some people can afford to work free and others cannot. But the same could be said of almost any opportunity that allows students from wealthier backgrounds to enhance their human capital more effectively than students from less privileged backgrounds." So....let me get this straight. You are suggesting that we unravel a century of progress in developing and enforcing fair labor and wage laws and protections for young workers, all because life isn't fair? Of course life isn't fair. Some individuals will always have more advantages than others. This does not give us license to actively make the playing field LESS level.	Life isn't fair.
5447264	"Assuming an unpaid internship is mutually beneficial and entered into freely by both parties, should such arrangements be illegal? " Just because we young people constitute a "willing party" when entering into an internship doesn't mean we are actually "willing". We simply have no choice. After all, for the ambitious among us, what's the alternative? Unless you have your sights on a career in venture capitalism/finance/etc., non-remunerated internships are all we know.	Internships are typically required to graduate, so they should be paid.
5445309	David Lat has it right. No one is forced into internships. Nor are those who enter such deals helpless--they can and should fend for themselves and not drag in the politicians and regulators. This seems like another excuse to expand the power of the state.	People who decide to work unpaid internships are free to also not work them if they feel exploited.
5445073	Sad to see the power of employers used to take advantage of relatively powerless young people to rob them of wages for their work . . . Yes, these young people may enter into the situation voluntarily and yes they can learn much there but they are still having their wages stolen from them.	Employers use their power to take advantage of powerless students. Despite the situation being voluntary and a learning environment unpaid internships are a theft of wages.
5445067	I went back to school in my mid-40s and earned a PhD. As a middle-aged, overweight female in a highly competetive field, I found most internships automatically closed to me. I finally had to accept one that paid less than $200 per month--and I had to move 1000 miles from home (renting an apt.) to take it. I learned a lot, and returned home to a good career in my field (after a 2nd lowly-paid year elsewhere--but at least that covered rent). I do understand that the internship site had financial problems. But I am very much aware that I was able to take that internship ONLY because I was a married woman with a husband who worked, and money in the bank. That should not be the norm.	Some internships barely pay and they are far away. The norm should not be that only independently funded students can do internship programs.
5451718	Great quote from a friend of mine who now lives in Germany (where they have real labor laws and a better economy, social services, etc): "People who don't have to work for a living shouldn't meddle with those of us who do." 'Nuff said.	Germany has better labor laws, economy and social services. The people who do not need to be paid to work should not be in the job market.
5450307	As a student, I don't mind internships that are considered volunteer positions as much as internships that are paid in college credit. I'm willing to work for free if I can gain valuable experience. I'm not willing to actually pay tuition to work, especially since full-time college students can get sufficient credit hours in four years as long as they don't fail any classes, making any extra college credits basically useless. If I were to place any restrictions on unpaid internships, I would say it's valid to limit the number of hours employers can require a student to work unpaid. If it's the summer and you're only working at your internship part-time, you can get another job to pay your expenses. Of course it's not fair to those who have no support from their families, but internships that actually provide experience in the field serve a pretty big value to society, and I don't think playing fair is a good enough reason to get rid of them altogether.	They're gaining valuable experience rather than money. They should limit the numbers of hours worked on unpaid internships. Internships that provide real experience in a field serve a big value to society.
5450222	I agree that unpaid internships exploit workers and should be regulated by the government. This has gotten absolutely out of hand. Minimum wage is minimum enough. Most companies can surely afford to pay these student-workers less than what they're worth (minimum wage), rather than nothing at all.	Minimum wage is low enough that companies should be able to afford to pay students. They should be paid minimum wage instead of working for free.
5449426	This lack of pay is not limited to high school or college internships. It is found throughout the business world. People are encouraged to blog for a major media organization not for pay, but for "the exposure," only to see that media organization sold to another company for hundreds of millions of dollars. Workers age 50 and over, who still have much to contribute, are thrown out of jobs in a subtle form of age discrimination and are then expected to work for free as part of their "retraining" to ease into a new profession that might pay thousands less in the end. Another poster on here mentioned volunteer workers who put in long hours while the heads of those charities reap huge salaries and benefits. The trend toward free labor is another indication of our moral decline. We have to take a stand. People, when you get up tomorrow morning and look at yourself in the mirror, repeat these words: "I WILL NOT work for free."	Unpaid interns contribute valuable content but aren't compensated financially for doing so when the company for which they intern is sold to another company. Not paying interns is free labor and is not moral.
5448130	Unpaid internships reserve vacational educational experiences and pre-professional development for children of the rich. This advantages them over those who have to pay their own way through university education. As one who spent summers on factory assembly lines while my classmates interned in museums, I am opposed to any kind of unpaid work for college and high school students. Voluntarism is a cheap cop out for employers and it should be strictly controlled and monitored.	Unpaid internships reserve experiences and development for children of the rich who already have advantages. Internships are abused by employers and they should be monitored for misuse.
5447986	What about those who apprentice or simply work for free in order to fulfill an opportunity to prove oneself worthy of future paid work? I worked for free and at night on low budget feature films until I proved myself skilled and worthy of joining the union. In recent past I've worked with so many unpaid or low paid interns, some of them great and some of them terrible. Regardless, they're on for a short period of time, those who do well are worthy of staying on in a paid position or being recommended somewhere else. They're coming to the table with virtually no experience and an apparent positive attitude. Some live up to it, some end up flailing. What was it Darwin said?	Internships permit students to work for free in order to prove that the student is worthy of future, paid work. Some unpaid and low paid interns are great, others are not. Internships only last for a short period of time, and those who do well will get a paid position or a recommendation. Interns come to the job with no experience and a positive attitude about it.
5446784	Unpaid internships=unpaid, period. They only benefit rich kiddies whose parents can pay their way, and squeeze out other people. When I was in law school, I was offered an "unpaid internship" at a large quasi-governmental agency. The train fare alone out to Virginia each day would have cost me $7.50 each day each way roundtrip, and I wouldn't even get reimbursed for that. When I had to turn them down, I got chided for "throwing away a great learning opportunity." Zoom fast forward to the dotcom days, where I had to compete against "unpaid interns" (usually heavily tattooed/pierced partners of others in the firms). Cleaning up their messes was always a treat...NOT. The ONLY internships that should be allowed are those that are done for real academic credit at an accredited university, with hours that take the student's class into account. Everything else is just exploitation.	Unpaid internships=unpaid, period. Only rich kiddies can afford to be exploited doing unpaid internships. Unpaid internships can cost a person more than they provide. Only internships that give academic credit should be allowed.
5445924	I don't like using unpaid interns, because i think that it is a form of elitism. I could never have afforded to work anywhere for free. Only students from families who can support them can afford to work for free, which excludes all of the students who are just scraping by to go to school and paying for it themselves. These students make the best employees. They take learning and work seriously. The problem is that graduates are now coming to the work force with far fewer skills and previous job experience than in previous generations. Many graduates have never held ANY job, be it baby sitting, dog walking or waitressing. I have found it preferable to hire graduates or students who are committed to working for more than a semester at a low wage with the understanding that due to their lack of experience, I will teach them, but they are more committed to stick around once they have learned and make great employees as their salaries go up with their abilities.	Unpaid internship benefits the wealthy and connected. It is unaffordable to work for free. Unpaid internships unfairly benefit wealthy students who can afford not to be paid for their work. These students are serious about learning and work. Unpaid internships take advantage of students by requiring them to work long an hard for work experience and no paycheck.
5446557	Unpaid internships are a bad idea for another reason. The ability to spend time during or after studies engaging in unpaid work is something not every student can afford to undertake. Many students need to work through school to support their studies, and many others will need paid work to begin paying off student loans. Unpaid internships, then, become a stepping stone that only the well-off can afford.	Not every student can afford to do unpaid work. Only people with money can afford to be unpaid interns since some people need to work to support them self or pay their loans.
5447530	I've been an intern at several places and can say that while there are educational elements to them, interns are mostly given grunt work to assist paid employees. After my experience, I have decided I will never be an intern and/or work for free again. A lot of people are fooled into believing that based on their grades and/or standing in school, there is no other way to get your foot in the door. That is not true. As a mediocre student, I was able to find a paid position where I worked, got paid, and just as well received the same educational value I would have received if I was unpaid. In my opinion, interns should receive minimum wage. Granted, they have no experience, minor if not any qualifications, and generally no practical knowledge. However, they use their limbs and their brains just as any paid employee. This would be most fair, and would certainly boost the United States economy.	Interns are given grunt work to assist paid employees. There are other ways to get your foot in the door besides unpaid internships. Unpaid internships exploit students, I was able to find a paid position, even with mediocre grades, and learned just as much as if I were unpaid. College students deserve a wage, even if they are unskilled. Interns work as hard as regular employees.
5445948	The fact is unpaid interns are not just students seeking experience. They are recent graduates who can't find a paid position, and unemployed workers trying to avoid gaps in their resumes. There is no doubt that employers are exploiting unpaid interns. I know several people who have interns at their jobs. These interns are replacing employees. It's just a way for an employer to save the $35,000 a year it would cost to pay a full-time employee. I routinely receive emails from people with multiple unpaid internships on their resumes. Most interns are not getting hired after their internship is completed. They are not learning new skills. Interns should be paid minimum wage.	Unpaid interns are not just looking to gain experience. Unpaid interns are unemployed people working to fill their resume and new graduates who can't get a paying job. Interns are replacing employees. It is just a way for companies to save money. Most interns won't get hired after and they aren't learning anything new.
5445253	What needs to happen is that insitutions of higher learning need to develop standards for internships. This should include a limit to the number of unpaid hours a worker can work in a week without triggering automatic compensation. Also companies should agree to interns representing only 5% of their workforce. The dirty little secret is that some companies are relying extensively on internships as a labor source. One of those companies is Disney, which has a good portion of its theme park workforce filled by interns. Then there must be standards for the work, flipping burgers or waiting tables are not acceptable intern experiences for college graduates.	Some companies depend on the free labor of interns. Standards of work should include minimum wages. Flipping burgers and waiting tables aren't good intern experiences.
5448454	Another problem faced by students is that of getting college credit. A lot of unpaid internships make up for the lack of a salary by offering to cooperate with colleges to give credit for the hours worked. Except that to get credit, it's up to the student to pay tuition fee attached to it. In effect, we have a system where students are paying out of their pocket (or taking out a bigger loan) in order to work. Not to mention that many colleges limit the amount of credit that can go to fulfilling something useful like a major.	College students are actually paying for internships through tuition. Students either take out loans, or pay out of pocket to work as an intern.
16700807	No one is suggesting that technology should replace human resources. It is true that racial minorities believe they experience unfair police scrutiny, but data-driven policing ensures that victim reports, not racial or ethnic biases, determine where police department focus their crime prevention efforts.	Minorities think they are scrutinized by police unfairly. Victim reports can be used to determine where prevention efforts are focused rather than race or ethicity.
16702265	Police departments have been doing this kind of thing all along. It's morally wrong. Intense supervision of dangerous areas is fine, as long as the cops don't aggravate their own fears and their hair trigger fingers. More educational and after-school programs are necessary. Kids need to have something safe to do while their parents are working. Why is that such a mystery to city governments?	This is not a new practice, but has been used for a long time. It is not moral.
8473382	Earlier in the last century the theater set designer Edward Gordon Craig dreamed of the 'über-marionette' so that he could create a more unified stage picture. This concept has been rolling around in the back of the minds of many designers and directors since then but has never really been achievable until recently. However , for better or worse it has also become extremely easy to do, anyone who can work a mouse can pretty much do it now, no skill needed (don't let anyone tell you that this is not a fact). The effect houses are moving offshore and will soon be the the animation sweatshops in the third world. It's a win win, directors (good nd bad) and even someone who never made a movie in there life can crank out dreck for very little money and big profit. I think the floodgates are just opening time to head for higher ground.	Computer generated imagery is simple to perform. Effect houses are moving to third world countries and will soon be run as sweatshops.
8470645	Today's hyper-enhanced CGI extravaganzas are not movies, they are video games, where the effects themselves are the featured attraction. It is sensory overload-----pacing, story, character development take a back seat to this new aesthetic. One can easily imagine some twenty- or thirty-something director, succored from birth on the slash-and-burn intensity of video games----and in the case of the very youngest in Hollywood, on MOVIES that have already been styled on such games-----working themselves into a frenzy on a computer, overdosing on special-effects software and whiz-bang CGI. One even imagines that it is the CGI that comes first------waking up in the middle of the night with an 'Oh, wow, that would be AWESOME!' kind of idea, they then build a movie around it only afterward. It is a new language, a new vernacular, of the filmmakers art. Whether anyone but the youngest speak this tongue is a moot point. As the saying goes, if you have to ask, you can't afford it. In this case, if you don't 'get' this new sensibility, you're not relevant in the first place.	CGI movies are video games because the effects are featured. movies become all about the special effects making pacing, story and character development irrelevant. It is easy to imagine a young director who grew up on intense video games and the movies based on them overdosing on special effects and CGI. CGI might actually be the inspiration for films, rather than the reverse.
14220309	Whenever there are huge contracts at stake, private for-profit corporations will vilify the scientists who object and will deny and disregard any facts that get in the way. Foreign for-profit corporations have been shown to override the concerns of local residents that will be directly affected by their schemes. Long term environmental risks and consequences often are no concern. Keep up the good work Dr. Hale.	If there are large contracts at risk. Foreign for-profit corporations don't consider the needs of residents. The long term environmental risks and consequences should be considered in the use of genetically modified mosquitos.
15674021	As a millennial living in Portland itself - I'm not interested in marriage at the moment, I'll never be able to afford children (my career path is in the nonprofit sector, because I'm not willing to sacrifice my values for a paycheck, and I wouldn't want my partner to have money as a top priority either), and the only reason I plan to own a home eventually is because it's cheaper in the long run than renting. My focus is on being happy and doing good. (One could even say that I am attempting to fix problems caused by older generations.) What exactly is childish about that?	I am a millennial and I don't want to be married, can't afford kids, and i will buy a house because it's cheaper than paying rent. Is it childish to focus on happiness and goodness and correcting issues created by earlier generations?.
13725505	The problem I see is with the twenty-somethings who demand to be treated like adults but refuse to pay their own way in life. I see more and more of these strange creatures sponging off of their parents, and I find their brazen entitlement infuriating. Play all the video games you want, party until you are blue in the face, but pay your own bills.	Some young people want to be treated like adults, but they won't pay their own way in life. Young people delaying adulthood are a drain on their parents. Young adults need to pay their own bills.
13683365	As others have noted, low-income millenials, in badly paid jobs have few options and a bleak future. But the high-income well-educated suburban-raised millenials flocking to SF and NYC and other cities, with jobs in tech, finance, media (and often financial help from parents) are doing pretty well. They feel pretty entitled to enjoy their delayed adulthood with their disposable income in bars, food delivery and chain stores. This demographic tsunami has displaced low and middle income residents of formerly intact neighborhoods in SF and NYC. But their delayed adulthood has other impacts as well - the affluent 20 and 30 somethings have little interest in civic issues, in voting. They support social issues such as gay marriage but little interest in economic issues such poverty or fair wages for delivery people.	The young people are replacing the residents of low and middle class neighborhoods in San Francisco and New York City. Delayed adulthood has other impacts as well - affluent 20's and 30's have little interest in civic issues,as in voting. Support social issues such as gay marriage, but little interest in economic issues . Such as poverty or fair wages.
13682409	The trend we are currently witnessing is along a childish continuum which began with the baby boomers.Behaviors we consider mainstream such as instant gratification,becoming one's children's friend and spouting of slogans such as "age is just a number"are considered childlish by older Americans as well as Europeans of a similar age.Similarly,acceptance that one should take one's twenties to find out what we want to do in life.The current generation has simply taken these behaviors a little further in the direction of infancy.Sadly we will only accept this when it is too late,when the sun has already set on a once great country.	Behaviors considered mainstream here are considered childish by older Americans and similarly aged Europeans. Young people are delaying adult responsibilities past their 20s.
13682364	I guess it would not be too bad, having half our children decide to live a Peter Pan life, if it was all children everywhere. But this is life style choice seems to be limited to America, Canada and Western Europe. I guess if we open our borders and allow potential adults from Latin America to fill our ranks then our American culture may survive for another generation or two. But we are unlikely to do that either. So what happens when the work-ethic and family values that made us what we are fade away to be replaced by play time and self indulgence? I am not so much nervous as saddened. A once great people, fading away in sybaritic torpor. For it is certain that if you are right and it is not just delay but denial of adulthood that the rest of the world will gladly eat our lunch. Which is too say, I doubt you are right. For the young people I know do not appear to be afraid or unwilling to grow up.	If the whole world were delaying adult life I think this would be acceptable, but with only western society doing this it puts us at a disadvantage. If it is true the young are denying adulthood the world will take advantage of them.
13682139	So some people don't want to get married or have kids or own property. So what? Maybe we've seen what happens to people who do all or some of those things (nasty divorce, bankruptcy, etc), and we don't like it. Maybe I'm actually doing the responsible thing in NOT doing any of those things.	Some people don't want to have kids, get married, or own property. Young people have seen what happens to people who do things like divorce and bankruptcy and don't like it.
13680708	"This is a rational response to the challenging economic climate." Herein lies a large part of the problem. We adults need to stop repeating this idea that it's due to the economy. Seriously? My father, who came from less than nothing, with no family to move back in with, built a home & cared for a very sick child with no insurance or public assistance at a time when inflation & interest rates on loans were double digits. There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education. So please, stop blaming this GREAT economy (low unemployment, low interest rates, strong markets, easy access, public assistance out the wazoo) & start looking within.	The problem doesn't lie with the economy, people need to start accepting some of the blame for their faults.
13679879	Some of us don't buy into the Leave It To Beaver fantasy that people like this author think we should all just Stepford our way into. With jobs that pay a living wage unavailable and college debt financially crippling for a lifetime, most young people don't see any good options because our generation took all the money and ran.	We don't all want to have the Leave It To Beaver family. Young people have low paying jobs and college debt and cannot easily start life early.
13678655	No one can ever truly afford to have a child. Mankind would have died out eons ago if we'd all waited. But then we lived VERY modestly on one income so we had no child care expenses. Anyone who graduates from college with 6 figure student loans is a fool - there are ways to get a college education without doing that. I agree that those with only a high school diploma absolutely must delay children until they achieve some financial stability - if they don't, they'll have a lifetime of poverty. But all these college-educated young who are delaying parenthood until their forties so they can obtain all the material things they desire and take all the trips are only fooling themselves. This is financial responsibility - this is an avoidance of adulthood.	If everyone waited until they could afford to have a child to procreate, mankind would die out.Hea. Young people delaying parenthood until their forties in exchange for material possessions and unique experiences is irresponsible. Financial responsibility is a part of adulthood.
13678921	Current circumstances allow young people to get to age 26 or 27 when they are finally brain-capable of understanding actions and consequences. Previously, it was assumed that by 18, or maybe 21, these children had fully formed emotional brains, while that was never so.	Today's world provides young people with the ability to delay the rituals of adult life by providing an environment that gives them time to understand actions and consequences. Young people are smart for taking advantage of these current circumstances. People do not have fully formed brains at 18 and 21 as previously assumed, meaning it is smart to delay adulthood.
3150627	I'm a regular, everyday biker. And in my experience, most cities have a variety of acceptable ways to get around on a bike. New York is different. The one-way avenues are hazardous, even for experienced bikers. Other than the West Side Highway, there are actually very few safe routes to take around Manhattan. A few strategically chosen routes can make a big difference here. But there are still not enough safe ways to get through Midtown. Maybe there never will be; Midtown is very congested.	NY bike lanes are not working because they are hazardous for bikers. The West Side Highway is one of the few safe routes available. The NY bike lanes do not provide enough safe ways through Midtown.
3129760	NYC should be using its resources for mass transit - not bicycles. Bicyclists are not former car drivers, they are former mass transit users. Bicycling will not reduce car use, but it will reduce mass transit use. Fewer mass transit users means it is easier to cut mass transit funding etc. Low income residents, the disabled and the elderly rely heavily on mass transit. Bicycling benefits young people. Cycling is great in low density European cities with low-rise buildings - but not in high-density NYC with one high-rise after another. The number of people (particular affluent people who are more likley to have cars, get deliveries such as Frsh Direct etc), the number of skyscrapers etc is the cause of car traffic in NYC.	People who ride bikes are people who used to ride mass transit, that's where NYC should invest. Bicycling will reduce mass transit use, which will make it easier to cut mass transit funding. Cycling is for low rise building cities not high rise building cities.
3126685	Get rid of them. They're destroying the character of the city. Add sidewalk space. Stop being hamstrung by loud-mouthed narcissists on bikes. I happen to be as green as they come--let's save what's still green outside the city and not ruin the character and vibrancy of the wonderful creative chaos of NY.	Get rid of New York's bike lanes. Bike lanes negatively effect the character of NY. Bicyclists are being to needy and are dictating policy.
3126034	North American cities were not designed with the bicycle in mind to start with wereas European cities were designed with pedestrians, bicycles, motorcylces in mind - to start with. Trying to retrofit Norht American cities for the bicycle is like trying to make the Tower of Pisa wheel chair accessible by putting in a ramp. The whole thing - the tower and the city is not conducive to these types of transportation from any and every angle.	In the US our cities weren't designed with bikes in mind like European cities were. Making streets bicycle accessible will not work because our road system is too old.
3125279	I am in my late fifties and have bicycle commuted most of my life. It began in college when my Bug broke down andI could not afford to fix it. I have vacationed on my bicycle, ridden to work on my bicycle, and gotten hurt too. But it is still the greatest form of transportation there is overall for health and the environment. The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd. It is so much more expensive to maintain automobile roads than those for cycle culture. Believe me, when the 5-6 dollar a gallon gas gets here, you will ride. And believe me, a couple of weeks of commuting or shopping with your bike will make you a believer! Riding your bike will also replace any membership at any fitness club around, and for far less cost than you would expect.	Biking is good for one's health and the environment. It is more expensive to maintain roads than bike lanes. Bike lanes are working because you get exercise while you travel.
3125211	Build it and they will come. New York City has had such a strong anti-bicycling stance for so many decades (remember Koch's midtown bike ban? remember when bicycling was prohibited on the GWB walkway?) that it's going to take awhile for some cyclists to start poking their heads out again. When less intrepid cyclists realize that bicycling is actually being encouraged, not discouraged, they'll give it a try. It's going to take time for the full value of dedicated bike lanes to be realized. Sorry, I can't sign onto the position of car advocates. They're probably climate change deniers, as well.	The bike lanes are a step up from old bike laws In NYC. Cyclists need to realize that bicycling is being encouraged and over time they will see the full value of these bike lanes.
3125041	I think bike lanes are a very good idea. This will promote more bicycle riding in town and make riding safer. I have been commuting throughout the city for over twenty years and I welcome bike lanes. What I don't like is the design and implimentation of these lanes. We don't need islands separating bike lanes from car lanes. This makes it more dangerous for both rider and pedestrians. Pedestrians are often not looking when they cross through bike lanes. Also, the wasted space of in many areas around Time Square. The Broadway bike lane just stops at 47th Street! What's up with that? It all seems to be designed by someone that is not a seasoned rider. Watch the messengers... Are they using the bike lanes? Not likely....	The design and implementation of these bike lanes is flawed. Islands separating bikes and cars make it more dangerous not safer. People are crossing the street and not looking for traffic in the bike lane. New York's bike lanes aren't working because they create a place where space is simply wasted in the vicinity of Times Square. The designer of the system was apparantly not a bike rider.
3124932	There are thousands of city residents that ride bicycles for work, such as messengers and food delivery men. Providing bike-only lanes not only allows for safety of these riders but also prevents the use of sidewalks by some of the law-breaking riders, which is a great hazard to pedestrians. I agree that it will take years for regular commuters to switch their mode of transportation to the bicycle, but allowing for this possibility is a great start. Don't forget that bicycle-friendly cities like Amsterdam have a system of public bicycles as well, which helps promote this eco and health-friendly mode of transportation. Finally, if car congestion and revenue for the city are problematic issues, perhaps we can implement a carpool system that only allows free access into Manhattan to cars with multiple passengers and would charge a toll for single drivers.	Many people ride bikes to work. Bike lanes ensure the safety of both bikers and pedestrians. Other large cities offer public bikes which promote a healthier lifestyle and are eco friendly.
3124350	Bikes lanes are one of the dumbest ideas Bloomberg has ever had. Large areas of Manhattan have now been reduced to single or double lanes where a taxi or two picking up or discharging a passenger stop traffic completely. Moronic.	Some areas in Manhattan suffer from clogged traffic do to the reduction of lanes.
3124188	It takes a while to change people's behaviors. People didn't start buying bottled water overnight... many thought it was crazy, same with bike commuting. I applaud the city for taking a bold stance. To those who say bikes are dangerous, I'm aware there have been deaths but give me a break. You're telling me a car is somehow safer for a pedestrian? Bikes improve safety (dedicated bike lane build outs slow down drivers), improve public health and give us more mobility options! And the drawbacks are less parking places and slower moving cars... big deal. And for the note by the writer that biking is a 3 season activity... nonsense. Unless there is nasty ice build up everywhere, put on a hat and stop bellyaching. I'm still biking to work even in our unseasonably cold December. And guess what? It's FREE and I get to my destination in 10 minutes instead of 25 if I were walking.	People just have to get used to the bike lanes. Bike lanes help with safety, health, and give more transportation options. I'm still able to bike to work. The bike lanes are low cost and fast.
3123078	I'm a native New Yorker who, in years past, never would have biked in the city because of fear for my safety. However, because of the new bike lanes, I now feel safe enough to bike around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. This summer, I bought a bike for the first time. Yesterday -- December 21 -- I biked 13 miles to visit my parents in Manhattan, riding 75% of the way on bike lanes. The assertions that (a) the bike lanes don't help move people from cars and public transit to bikes, (b) bikers stop using the lanes in the colder months, and (c) bikers prefer non-bike-laned streets are all false in my case. Which is more likely: that I'm an outlier, or that a program that encourages people to bike by making streets safer for bikers and supplying new bikers with free maps of safe routes around the city is actually working as Bloomberg claims it is?	Just having lanes for bikes make NY's  program a success. The bike lanes make me feel safe enough to bike where I live in Brooklyn. Saying that bike lanes don't help give people options besides cars, bikers dislike them, and bikers don't use lanes in the colder months seems all false in my personal story.
3122635	One of my bicycling habits when returning from a ride in Manhattan I count the number of cyclist crossing the Manhattan Bridge city bound. Seven or eight years ago if there were 40 to 50 cyclists and I deemed that a lot. This past summer the count was more like seventy to eighty. I am on the bridge in mid-morning. These are all young people (I'm in my late sixties) going to work. They are the not the spandex cyclist that appear on the weekend. When I worked the bike took me to the Con ed powerhouses throughout the city. The bike lanes were in there infancy some twenty years ago. Bloomberg has added many miles to them now and our biking population will grow exponentially (I hope!)..	The number of city-bound cyclists to Manhattan has almost doubled in the last seven years. Bike lanes were brand new twenty years ago. Bloomberg has added to the New York Bike lanes, which will lead to an increase in the biking population.
3122521	Im fine with the bicyclists and the bike lanes. Just enforce traffic laws on bicyclists!!!!! No more running red lights or stop signs or riding on sidewalks. That's all I ask. Including the Prospect Park West lane - when I cross that bike lane to go into the park I don't want to be run down by a bicyclist I can hardly see because of the limited sight distance. As a driver I stop and wait at lights, and so should the bicyclists.	Some people are not bothered by bicycle lanes.
3122701	This is certainly a reasonable essay. Cops need to start writing tickets for all infractions: cars, bikes, and occasionally feet. I don't know how else to get our population to behave more predictably. I love biking in the city, but I cannot go very fast in the bike lanes because sheeple (usually on cell phones), dogs on long leads, and cars (with drivers usually on cell phones) seem to be oblivious. They stagger in and out of our lanes like zombies. I can ride much faster and safer when I ride with the cars in the car lanes. People on cell phones and dogs on long leads are afraid of cars. As a biker, I use that fear to my advantage. The only other way I can imagine getting people to pay attention to where they are, might be to add some heft and/or pointy things to bikes, so that when a pedestrian wanders in front of one they might be impaled or knocked good and hard. That might learn them to look up from their mindless daze.	Bike lanes are not effective because pedestrians, dogs, and cars don't observe them. New York Bike lanes are unsafe for the riders.
3129951	HT (#27): "So many other bikers that I have observed have this inflated sense of self-entitlement, like they are doing a favor for the environment." Cyclists' attitudes notwithstanding (YMMV), are you off your rocker? Of COURSE cyclists are doing a huge favor for the environment. Can you say "asthma"? or "particulate pollution"? Not to mention lung-cringing CO, heat-trapping CO2, PAHs, or the sheer waste of precious oil (and human lives) in dragging a tonne of steel, rubber, plastic, and glass around just to move a single person. Car drivers are the spoiled and subsidized minority here -- that is what the CM people are getting at I think: the unspoken and unwritten assumption that the privilege of driving a car should be considered a right. After all, the first tarmac roads were built for bikes, not for cars.	Many bikers have inflated sense of doing a favor for the environment. Increased cyclists in New York helps the environment.
3122378	What a great discussion, with not one voice against increased bicycle penetration into the asphalt of New York. The tide is turning, and it's best to be ahead of the wave...let's take to our bikes, and I agree, as we all cycle more, the streets will be safer not only for us but for everyone who shares them. @Winthrop-back at you, Buffalonian!	Bike lanes will make New York safer for everyone to bike.
3122362	I commute to work by bicycle every morning up 1st ave, and every evening home down 2nd. I have done so every day, year-round for over a decade. Before that in Boston, Chicago, and Rome. Had a couple close calls riding over the last 25 years, but nothing extraordinary. To date, nothing has threatened my life with greater intensity or frequency than the consequences of these bike lanes. They are death traps for cyclists, pure and simple. NYC bike lanes have been paved with good intentions... that's the best I can say about them.	These New York bike lanes are the greatest threat to my life. Bike Lanes are death traps for bike riders.
3526042	Look, I've been riding my bike in Brooklyn for over half a century -- and on Cape Cod. The bike lane on Prospect Park West is an eyesore. Look back from the old Sanders Theater towards Grand Army Plaza -- you'll see that the cars parked in what used to be the third lane throw off the straight line running to the monument. I'm the sort who for years has been unplugging electronics to save electricity, keeping my house at 60 degrees in winter, and relying only on ceiling fans in summer. Not liking the bike land isn't being a NIMBY. It's recognizing that some beauty has been lost.	Prospect Park West looks better without a bike lane. The parking problems caused by the bike lanes are ruining attractions. One doesn't have to like the bike lane.
3127716	I bike regularly as exercise and have experimented with the city's initiative , attempting to bike to work. My commute is not long, from the west 100's to 60th st and Madison and so can even take advantage of central park as well as the bike lanes. I soon found that on the rare occasions when I could bike successfully without some heart stopping near or actual accident which most often caused by pedestrians not looking at bike lanes, that when I did arrive at my destination there were few if any places to lock my bike. So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment. I am afraid my experience is not unique. I expect that unless proper parking locking facilities are provided in sufficient amount and locations the experiment will continue to serve a very small part of the population. As the accidents and injuries add up the city will eventually be forced to abandon this wasteful poorly thought out experiment..	New York's bike lanes are not working because there is a constant threat of danger when riding in them and not enough areas to park a bike when the destination is reached. There needs to be more parking available for bikes, otherwise not everyone can participate. New York's bike lanes are causing many accidents and injuries, the project was wasteful and not well planned.
3126130	City streets and living are not designed for bicycling and therefore should not be used for that purpose. That is what suburban living is about. It is simply a lie that bikes are able to promote a greener city. The traffic backups due to loss of driving lanes are certainly causing the use of increased amounts of gasoline and therefore more toxic emsissions into the air.	City streets are not bicycle friendly. The loss of driving lanes are causing more congestion and pollution.
3126129	To No. 96, I am well aware that current NY law treats bikes and cars as the same and expects bikes to obey the exact same laws as cars. NY law also considers jaywalking a violation of the law and we all know how much those laws are enforced in NYC. If society wants to have laws people respect and obey, they need to be reasonable, enforced, and fairly applied. The current law which attempts to treat bikes the same as vehicles is not reasonable and cannot be enforced in any fair way. Just as it would be impossible to enforce jaywalking laws in NYC. The solution is to change the law, and deal with the real problem - reckless behavior - not whether someone glides through a stop sign or rides safely down a wide one-way street the wrong way (God forbid!) when it presents a danger to no one.	Laws should be reasonable, enforced, and fairly applied in order to be complied with. Bikes must not be treated like cars. New York's bike lanes aren't working and the solution is to deal with the problem of reckless behavior by changing the law.
3125570	Bike lanes would work a heck of a lot better if bicyclists obeyed traffic signals and rode in the right direction. How many times have pedestrians tried to cross with the light only to be nearly hit by a bike riding against traffic through a red light? This happens all the time in Soho crossing Price Street walking south.	Bike lanes do not work because cyclists do not follow rules. Pedestrians are in danger of being hit my cyclists running red lights.
3123867	The bike lanes are a fantastic idea - but there needs to be strict enforcement of traffic laws for cyclists. Many show no regard for red lights, one way streets, or for even using the lanes. Getting out of a car or cab is hazardous as many cyclists do not use the bike lanes and instead use the other side of the street and then complain when doors open etc. and endager them. Similarly, one now has to assume that a cyclist will ride through an intersection regardless of the traffic light, endagering pedestrians.	Bikes lanes are a good idea. Bikers show no regard for red lights, one way streets, or for even using the lanes. Exiting a car is hazardous. Bikers use the other side of the street, then complain when doors open etc. and endanger them. Assumption is that cyclists will ignore traffic lights at intersections and endanger pefestrians.
3123554	Do bike lanes and additional bike traffic make conditions for car traffic worse? Of course they do. Should we support it? Yes. Driving a car in the city is not an inalienable right that takes priority over all other forms of transportation. Does car traffic make conditions for bike traffic worse? Of course it does. Should we support it? No. The more bike riders, the less cars, the less danger, and a greener planet. This car centric attitude is the real root cause to the gridlock problem in the city, not the introduction of more efficient, greener and overall safer transportation.	They reduce motor-vehicle traffic, which contributes to a greener planet. Cars are the real cause of traffic problems.
3123005	The only thing that makes bikes in the city absolutely maddening is the fact that bike riders do not obey traffic rules. They just plain don't. Every time I hit the streets on foot I have to dodge a cyclist who is ignoring a red light, riding the wrong way on a one-way street, riding on the sidewalk, making a turn on a red light and on and on. No one monitors them or makes them face the consequences of the hazards they pose. The recent proliferation of bike rental businesses is a sign that the mayor wants this in a bad way. The people who rent cycles to tourists don't bother telling them they aren't allowed to ride on the sidewalks or the footpaths in central Park. The pedicabs are now just as bad and they're carrying naive tourists in the back seat on a ride to catastrophe.	Bikes in NYC are maddening. Bicyclists do not adhere to traffic laws. Bike lane laws are not adequately enforced. Tourists are scammed into using the bike lanes.
3122593	as a biker in NY for 30 plus years, i am so incredibly happy that the bike lanes are there - and hope that they will eventually be designated on EVERY avenue and selected streets. they make my life so much easier! heavier traffic? well, let drivers learn that they should use public transportation or get onto bikes more! i realize that cars are needed and take taxis OCCASIONALLY myself, but far less frequently thanks to my trusty bike! my biggest complaint? some pedestrians think the new bike lanes are an extra sidewalk for them - and where they are only painted, some cars think that these are terrific spots to pull over for a while - so we are forced to get back into traffic. why don't the police start to ticket these cars and at least hand out warnings to the pedestrians? go bike lanes go!!!!	One can avoid and improve heavy traffic by using public transportation or biking.
11673623	This is a horrible idea. Anyone who has worked on the border, or in Mexico (as I do), knows there are plenty of middle and upper-class Mexicans who come to the U.S. for an education. I think Dr. Lee is really perpetuating stereotypes here. In my opinion, affirmative action should be based on economic class, no matter what the race.	Affirmative actions should be based on income because middle and upper-class Mexicans travel to the US to receive an education. I feel leaving race out of the picture would better serve those that actually need affirmative action.
11667948	The Texas "Top 10% Plan, which guarantees admission to any student who finishes in the top 10 of his or her graduation class, works best. Under the old system, which was based on race and ethnicity, middle- and upper-income Hispanics got all the acceptance letters. Now that the 10% rule in in effect, Hispanic students from the barrio schools are, for the first time, getting acceptance letters. The income-based plan won't work because low-income white students academically outperform low- and lower-middle income Hispanic students.	High performers should be rewarded over all others. Low income white students academically outperform low income Hispanic students.
11669136	This is so incredibly presumptuous and racist. Ms. Lee actually thinks she represents and can speak for all Asians. There are many Asians who do not go to Chinese schools or Korean schools after school, and whose parents are at best middle class. I see plenty of Korean store owners who do not seem like people who went to college. And what about whites? AA affects middle class whites every bit as much as Asians, if not more. What a ridiculous presumptuous argument.	Affirmative action disadvantages average families.
11670926	I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in.	Affirmative action should be based on class. If race is such a big part of the economic hardships and the reasons people are denied opportunities, then economic based actions would be a better solution. Affirmative action would discriminate based solely on race. Affirmitive Action is a racist idea assuming race is the only factor in ability.
11670084	I have two friends who are African American. She is a physician, he is an engineer. Should their daughter get any advantage over a white kid who grew up in a trailer full of meth addicts in the Ozarks? It is logical to replace racial preference with class preference, and it is 100% constitutional, so you don't have any proposition 209 issues.	It is logical and constitutional to replace racial preference with class preference.
11668607	What was the voter's intent in Michigan, California, and Florida? Was it to replace overt racial preferences with similar but less transparent and complex racial preferences? No. It was to eliminate racial preferences. PERIOD. How is this not clear? Those here who openly discuss and plan to subvert the will of the voters based on their personal ideology is a disgrace to our system. You've been ordered by the voters to stop this, so stop it. Now. I support the effort to give any child with distinct socioeconomic disadvantages the pathway to a college education, but I don't support it as solely a means to an end to implement the same racial preferences that were just banned.	I would like every child with an economic disadvantage to be helped, but I see this as trying to implement the racial preferences in a round about way.
11669717	We should establish a Disenfranchised Index that looks, at many things ( examples include): neighborhood, parents (one or two), parent's own education and their income, family stability and environment, family history around employment, public assitance access to opportunityetc) and help those that score lower as early in life as possible. It should focus on everthing BUT race and gender as there are many succesful people of of each race and gender that they are not inidcators of success. One way to move beyond race and gender problems is to downplay them so that they become unnecessary to look at for evauluating anyone for employment.	Affirmative action should consider a variety of life determiners provide needed help as early as possible. Affirmative action should not focus on race and gender. With people of all races and gender having been successful economic origin is the main disparity left.
11668966	There are also disadvantaged capable students with great potential, of all races, who drop out of high school due to the emotional impact of toxic abusive environments that degrade and fail to provide the foundation they need to succeed at much of anything. Of course going to college is the furtherest thing from their minds. And due to the huge amount of family discord, abuse, and dysfunction out there, the numbers of lost children and lost potential--that eventually affects us all in one way or another--is no doubt staggering. Therefore, somehow helping this group overcome their challenges so they can likewise move forward and fulfill their potential should also somehow become an offshoot goal of Affirmative Action as it struggles to redefine itself.	Capable students often drop out of college due to a toxic abusive environment.
11666716	Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race. In Silicon Valley, there are many non-Caucasian children of multimillionaires, who live in $3 to $15 million houses, receive as much tutoring and college counseling help as they need, attend expensive summer camps/programs, and travel the world before they are 18 years old. They don't need preferences when it comes to school and college admissions.	Socioecomonics should play a higher role in college admissions instead of race. There are children of rich people in Silicon Valley who do not need assistance with college admissions.
11670543	Wealth did not work for me for financial aid. My dad owned a 15 unit apartment building and that was considered to be worth $200,000 on my FAFSA. The run-down building had a leaky roof and lost money, and was torn down a few years later at a total loss. My parents total income was $11,000 at the time, and they were expected to contribute $4,500 per year (they said no). Hence, I went to a state school. I think income is better!	Wealth does not always work for the individual with regards to financial aid. Parents are required to contribute too much of their income to school. Income makes a better way to judge affirmative action.
11666969	Family wealth or lack of it is not a valid indicator of capability for college level academic study and is inappropriate, as is family or personal income, for use by a college or university in deciding whether to offer an applicant admission. Both are appropriate in deciding whether to assist a successful applicant financial assistance. The two decisions are not logically related, and attempting to combine them is certain to lead to poor results.	Wealth is not a good indicator of academic ability. Both ways are appropriate to decide whether to help an applicant with financial assistance. Income and affirmative action are not related to each other and should not be considered together.
12408877	Citations rather than arrests for minor crimes still make a lot of sense. But I'm not sure that would have helped here---the guy who commits the same crimes over and over, and resists arrest, is likely to fail to appear in court, and then you're stuck with arrest as a solution. Ultimately, if the perceived price to the individual of defying or ignoring the law is lower than the benefits they think they get from breaking the law, you have a big problem.	If people can get away with breaking small laws, they will be more likely to break big ones.
12408129	Not only is broken windows policing effective at preventing minor crime, and doing so at far less cost and risk and with lesser punishments, but it contributes strongly to the quality of life, and that shouldn't be underestimated. A boom car isn't as serious as a drive-by killing, but try getting work done on Saturday afternoon when the guy across the street is driving one. We need to prevent major crimes, but we also need to maintain a livable, civil environment in which to live our everyday lives.	Broken windows policing saves money and increases quality of life, a powerful achievement. We need to cut down own minor violations, but we should also make a civil environment.
12406041	Prior to the concept, and under Mayor Dinkins, New York was known as the city from hell. Do we want to go back? Let's not make the leap from the Garner case to this bad idea of non enforcement of so called low level offenses.	The Garner case is an exception, in general enforcing minor violations deters more serious crime.
12404722	People who are in the habit of behaving with civility tend not to commit minor crimes and to not disrespect the lives of others. Police work that enforces minor offenses and quality of life ordinances sends the message that uncivil behavior will not be tolerated. Some in poorly policed areas are characterized by a lot of people who live in distress, are exposed to criminal behavior on a daily basis, and are exposed to significant numbers of people who are used to acting out without any consequences. In such areas the worst behaving people end up determining the living conditions of all.	People who are civil still can sometimes commit minor crimes. Enforcing minor violations sets the level of civility that is to be expected in neighborhoods. Some people in certain areas are used to being able to act out.
13652278	Shut down the CIA & be prepared to tolerate more terrorism on US soil. Without Humint, the U.S. would be seriously handicapped in deterring & stopping terrorism and even a surprise nuclear attack. The CIA collects not only Intel related to terrorism, they collect military Order of Battle intelligence. Eliminating the Agency would lose ground level Humint from our defense effort.	Without the CIA, there would be more terrorism on US soil. We need the CIA because it collects intel related to terrorism and the military. Eliminated it would hurt our defense effort.
13651224	After the cold war we reduced the number of agents, and the presence of the CIA. When 9/11 occurred we not only were caught very flat footed, but we did not have covert people on the ground and had to spend years putting that whole thing back together again. I think we simply rise and fall in these pendulums because we think we can do without it until we need it.	The CIA has already been downsized since the end of the cold war. We did not have covert people on the ground when 9/11 occurred, and it took years to put it back together again.
13664326	As crucial as a toothache. Wherever terrorism lives, the CIA was there first, sneaking around propagating colonialist policies on behalf of the military-industrialist-energy complex, creating implacable enemies for the American people. No better than the Dulles brothers turning South America into a murder fest on behalf of United Fruit and Chiquita.	The C.I.A is a nuisance, not a necessity. Wherever terrorism lives the CIA was there first propagating policies on behalf of the American people and creating implacable enemies.
13659246	Mr. Kornbluth asserts that CIA agents are dedicated individuals whose only goal is to serve and defend the country. That statement is as empty as a whiskey barrel at an Appalachian stomp festival. How does one serve the country? Do you serve the country by violating its fundamental principles with torture, even if it yields, which it didn't, helpful information? Are you defending the country by inciting terrorist groups who use your crimes as recruiting tools? The CIA missed the collapse of the Soviet Union. It missed the 9/11 attack; it led us into a war with Iraq by supporting false intelligence; it missed the upheavals in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests? It seems very clear their definition is consistent with the Barry Goldwater/ Neocons/Dick Cheney dictum: Excess in defense of liberty is no vice. And this, of course, profoundly and utterly misses the point.	The CIA violates American laws for no reason. The CIA creates more enemies for the US through it's actions. The CIA missed many key events that occurred in the last 30 years.
13653221	Exactly a month after JFK was assassinated, Harry Truman wrote an op-ed in the Post stating that had he known the shenanigans the CIA were going to pull, instead of simply providing information to the President, he never would have signed it into law. (Allen Dulles had the piece pulled after the morning edition.)	The CIA has a tendency to pull shenanigans instead of giving pertinent information.
13651841	The CIA reminds me by its recent actions of the old joke, "Military Intelligence is a contradiction in terms." To the extent that the CIA has become militarized and lawless, (which is the real reason that the prison at Guantanemo was established, so that torture could take place without the oversight of U.S. law) it has become a detriment to the nation, and a blot on the United States' reputation. We should disband the CIA and assign its responsibilities to civilians who will obey the laws and understand the consequences of covert actions to our foreign relations. The State Department should be well up to the task. Faulty intelligence leads to lost wars and continual embarrassment for the politicians who rely on it. The CIA should have no ties to the Department of Defense, so that operations can be unfettered by a military mindset.	They have become militarized, lawless and a detriment to the nation. The CIA agents involved need to be held accountable for their actions. Bad intelligence loses wars and is an embarrassment.
13651833	Rizzo gives us vague generalities about the usefulness of the CIA. Let's turn that around and ask for some demonstrable lists of vital support they have provides over the last two decades. Oh yes, and as a lawyer, Rizzo should be sure to separate the list into legal and illegal support. In other words, let's start from the premise that the CIA has been an irresponsible rogue organization and have them prove otherwise. I know, never going to happen. Our leaders have no will for accountability -- it may be a competition between President Obama and Congress as to which branch of government is less interested!	Rizzo will not be specific about the usefulness of the CIA. It should be assumed that the CIA has been an irresponsible rogue organization and they should prove how they have not been.
13651544	As Truman stated so many years ago, "It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas." Indeed, the CIA/NSA has become an all powerful, unaccountable, unconstitutional fourth wing of government in control of the Executive and running our foreign policy to the detriment of the world and of our basic rights as citizens. The CIA has always been above the law, uncontrollable and unaccountable. It is responsible for more crimes against humanity than any other organization or government, orchestrating civil wars, coups, establishing brutal dictatorships from Guatemala to Chile to Iran, training and overseeing death squads and torture around the globe. It is past time to abolish this monstrous institution along with its other faces; NSA, NATO, USAID and put intelligence gathering back in the military with heavy, independent oversight to prevent abuse. It is time to prosecute those responsible for international crimes and human rights abuse. It is also telling that the Times, know to be connected to the CIA, didn't have former CIA analyst Ray McGovern in this conversation.	The CIA causes more problems for US security than it solves. Our basic rights as citizens, as well as the power of the Executive branch, have been eroded by the CIA/NSA, as has the country's foreign policy and global security as a whole. The CIA is difficult to control. The CIA is responsible for many crimes against humanity. The C.I.A isn't needed.
13657334	It would be much easier to dismantle or close down the C.I.A. instead of reforming a humongous bureaucratic para-military-intelligence organization that has lost its basic mission statement. That is, collect and analyze material/information from foreign countries, friends or foes, and provide the political leadership with useful intelligence material to defend and protect the national security of the United States. The CIA involved in war crimes and torture comes at no surprise to any person over 40 living in Africa, Asia and Latin America. During the cold war, the agency was the main instrument of foreign policy used by the White House to destabilize unfriendly third world governments or fight proxy wars against the Soviet Union. Torture techniques were honed during that time. What to do with the CIA? downsize that humongous dysfunctional organization, retrain its personnel to do real intelligence data collection to protect the national security of the US. That is all.	The CIA is too large and corrupt to be reformed. The CIA has historically been involved in war crimes and torture. The CIA is only good for destabilizing governments and fighting proxy wars. The CIA is dysfunctional and needs retraining to do real intelligence collection to protect the US.
13654711	After the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the lies that accompanied it, President Kennedy's wish -- regrettably unfulfilled -- was to "splinter the C.I.A. into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds." In the nearly 54 years since then, there's precious little evidence that this was a bad idea.	The CIA has a spotty history and Kennedy himself wished them dismantled. Their is little evidence that the C.I.A. was a bad idea.
13650630	The CIA's impunity is only underscored by the Senate panel deciding against consequences for CIA spying on Senate Committee work, as well as no consequence for Brennan directly lying to Congress. It seems they've gone beyond quasi-autonomous. They don't seem to answer to anyone. Instead WH attorneys scrambled to create a work around for what they did. You didn't mention their failure at their actual job---predicting world events. Are they too big to be sidelined? Why such impunity and lawlessness with no accountability?	The C.I.A. has become more than quasi-autonomous. The CIA doesn't answer to anyone. The C.I.A. does not correctly predict world events. The CIA has impunity and lawlessness without being held accountable.
13650337	"A revivified C.I.A. is necessary today to fight against radicalism, militancy and the forces of anarchy that threaten the region from Bangladesh to Morocco." Mr. Nawaz, the CIA is one of the biggest contributors to radicalism and wars. Your own country of origin is exhibit 1.	We don't need the C.I.A. because the C.I.A. instigates wars and radicalism.
13657157	Secrecy avoids accountability, and allows anonymous violation of the law, which goes unpunished. The wholesale violation of human rights, rendition (kidnapping by any other name), torture and killing of persons, guilty or innocent, and subversion of other countries governments, from Iran and Guatemala in the beginning to Afghanistan today, shows the CIA and America to be just another colonizing power taking what it wants for itself and its businesses. It should be dumped, and its functions returned to the State Department and Military [where lawyers still honor their oath to protect the Constitution. US Army 1969-1971/California JD	Secrecy avoids accountability, it allows anonymous violation of the law, which goes unpunished. CIA just shows America is taking what it wants.
13653112	William Donovan-head of the OSS during WWII, which was the predecessor to the CIA, had doubts about continuing the agency in peacetime. he was right. one of the problems with the CIA's covert activities is that they are usually only covert to the American people. those on the receiving end of these activities know perfectly well what is going on. the American people had no idea that the CIA was overthrowing the elected govt of iran in 1953, but the Iranians knew it. when there is blowback the American public's reaction is-why do they hate us. we didn't do anything to them	The CIA is not very secretive which makes them ineffective.
18068301	NATO (North Atlantic, should a reminder be needed, Treaty Organization) comprises nations influenced by and whose social and political thought is based upon The Enlightenment. Turkey is modern Near Eastern empire-wannabe with more in common with its Ottoman ancestors than with the democracies of NATO. Turkey's sole reason for its membership in NATO is "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." As for being a "force for democracy" I posit that without the equivalent of Europe's Enlightenment there can be no democracy.	Turkey does not have much in common with the rest of the countries in NATO. The only reason Turkey can be in NATO is that it is the enemy of NATO's enemies.
18046225	Simply put as long as NATO lives Turkey will be the core element of it. Strategically and militarily Turkey is far more important than Israel, Germany or Saudi Arabia. Only UK is an alternative for NATO in a long run. Just look at the map, GDP, population growth projections, future flash points etc. NATO was established before all of this writers even born. And it will be needed more and more in coming years w/o any question.	Turkey will always be a core element of NATO. Turkey is still an important part of NATO.
18040495	I can't get past the awful genocide in WWI they enacted on the Armenians and can't admit it. That's a country that will do it again. It's worth a read by anyone who has never researched it. It is shocking. In many of their ways they are anti-western and NATO is about protecting the west. I would never trust Turkey.	Turkey committed genocide against the Armenians, will not admit it and is likely to commit similar crimes. Turkey is an anti-western nation, I do not trust them to protect the west as NATO was designed to do.
18038746	Erdogan's increasing repression of civil rights, his increasingly Islamist rhetoric to consolidate his base, and his violent and almost single-minded repression of the Kurds scares me. How can we be partners with a country that bombs its own people, breaking a cease fire to do so?	Erdogan has a history or repressing civil rights and violence. Turkey broke a cease fire to bomb it's own citizens, we can't partner with a country like that.
18047210	Turkey never had any democracy, just the veneer of democracy. The most important aspect of democracy is the rule of law. When the police can knock down a door in the middle of the night and grab someone from his/her house without a warrant, never to be heard again, that's not democracy. When police stations are nothing more than dungeons where people are tortured, that's not democracy. Ottoman Empire essentially ended with a coup, a foreign dictator was put in charge, and after his death, we had numerous military coups till Erdogan arrived. Turkey cannot be democratic, because over 80% of its population are ignorant people, much like the rest of ME population, who under Erdogan feel free to explore their Islamic roots again.	Turkey does not belong in NATO because it has a poor human rights record and only appears to be democratic. There are too many non-democratic citizens in Turkey.
18039473	All four points of view are incorrect. 1) Turkey Has Been Reckless, Repressive and Unreliable. Turkey is going back to its Ottoman roots. 2) NATO Can Be a Force for Democracy in Turkey NATO is about defense. It has never been a force for democracy anywhere ever. 3) NATO Must Demand More From Turkey NATO can't demand more from Turkey. 4) Turkey Is Vital to NATO Militarily Turkey, and many other NATO countries, are completely unreliable. But certainly Europe should not have spent so much capital kicking Greece around.	Turkey is necessary to the NATO military.
18044030	NATO can do what it wants, but Turkey can simply let the migrants through, and NATO will again be begging Turkey to shut the door. Turkey knows it has NATO by the leash. And Turkey will do what is good for Turkey.	Turkey's poor record on human rights should not be a NATO member as it does not follow the principle's of NATO.
18039520	Turkey did not lead the world into the two 20th Century World Wars. And the perpetrators of the two deadliest holocausts in World War II was not Turkey. Imperial Japan murdered 30 million Chinese. Nazi Germany slaughtered 27.5 million Soviets. Turkey is more democratic civil secular plural egalitarian than Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Yemen etc. NATO is a military war alliance that has nothing to do with democracy nor peace nor justice nor morality.	Turkey practices a different leaning ideology than other nearby countries in NATO. NATO has little to do with peace or justice, it is just a war machine.
18038285	The Turkish military was always the standard bearer of Ataturk' policy and secular outlook. True, sometimes its intervention was too rough, but at least it kept Turkey apart from fundamentalist Islam. Now Turkey is far apart from Democracy and Secularism. This is dangerous for Turkey and for Europe.	Turkey is dangerous to NATO because they are not democratic and secular.
13041180	Can Mr. Montaner explain why the USA aided and sheltered Luis Pasada, a convicted terrorist who blew up a Cuban Airliner killing 37 innocent people? I find it incredible that we trade freely with Vietnam and China, two communist nations, but for some reason the US cannot establish relations with Cuba?	Incredibly, the US seems unable to heal relations with Cuban.
13041019	Those who argue to continue the embargo are not sincere. They are representing the families of the rich land owners who fled Cuba after the revolution. They just want their land back, but that is not in the people's best interest...of Cuba or the US. Even today's Communist Cuban government is not as repressive as the rulers they replaced.	Sanctions for Cuba are only in place because of Cuban refugees in America. It is not in the best interest of Cuba or the US for them to get their land back. Today's Communist Cuban government is not as repressive as the rulers they replaced.
13040340	The Cuban Embargo has been a tragic farce for decades. Ever since the USA normalized relations with China and Russia our continued lack of normal relations with Cuba has stood out as one of the worst and most hypocritical policy decisions ever made by the USA. If we finally change this policy it will be one a wonderful thing and the whole world will applaud. Normalize Cuba Now!	The Cuban Embargo has been a joke for decades. Continued lack of normal relations with Cuba stands out as one of the worst policy decisions made by the USA. This policy would be good and would be applauded by the rest of the world.
13039956	Wait, we have trade and diplomatic relations with China, which is by all practical means a dictatorship, but we can't have the same with Cuba? How long are we going to appease the Batista cronies in the United States and heirs? All they care about is their property rights.	China is basically a dictatorship and the US does business with them.
13039830	The US embargo on Cuba only helps maintain the status quo in Cuba while being a self inflicted wound on the US, especially the Gulf States of Alabama, Louisianna and Mississippi. The embargo has throttled down major trade along the Mississippi affecting trade from New Orleans to Chicago. The lost trade and development is astronomical. We must remember that Cuba was one of our most important trading partners at the time the embargo was imposed. The embargo had a direct impact on the decline of southern economies. US policy is driven by emotion rather than any realistic policy that might bring about change. How long must the people of the United States be forced to maintain a foolish policy driven by the self interests of a small politically connected community?	Ending the embargo would benefit both Cuba and the U.S. The embargo hurts our own economy. Before the embargo Cuba was one of our best trading partners and now we are losing lots of trade. The Cuba embargo impacted the decline of southern economies. Cuban sanctions are emotion driven and will not result in change.
13038883	Of course it is time! It should have been done long ago. How has the embargo benefitted us or the Cubans or any of the past participants over the years? It has not. It is a foolish remnant of a Cold War which ended long ago in a different time and existed in a much different world. Foolish saber-rattling by foolish people in a foolish effort. The embargo belongs in history books, not on our back porch.	The embargo has not benefited Cuba or the US. The sanctions are leftover from the Cold War, a different era of thinking. The embargo belongs in the history books.
13038586	The historical importance and portent of both Cuba and Viet Nam is that a united nation with a will and solid determination can DEFY the ISA and survive for America to reconsider and start pulling back. The price paid by both is almost super human , the outcome justifies it.	Sanctions will not have an effect against a strongly unified and determined nation.
13068403	Ted Henken rightly refers to Cuba's "dismal human rights record," but neglects to acknowledge that the United States is in no position to evaluate it. It is an act of imperial hubris for the United States to judge Cuba's human rights record, and in order for us to take such a judgment seriously we would have to ignore the dismal human rights record of the United States and the massive heap of corpses that US foreign policy is responsible for. The purpose of the embargo, of course, was to "cause hunger, desperation and the overthrow of the Government," and as such is a far greater crime than any Cuba has committed under the despicable Castro regime.	Sanctions against Cuba are examples of imperialist policies by country with a bad human rights record. Sanctions intentions in Cuba, of causing distress are a greater crime than any of Castro's Regime.
13040191	The long list of horrid players that the United States has done business with, (put in place in some instances) is filled with folks so much worse than the Castros. Yeah, they've done bad stuff, and yeah, your families had land and stuff taken away, and people have a tough time. Tell me about China. Tell me about the Saudis. Tell me about Saddam Hussein and the money and weapons we gave him. And Mubarak. And Bin Laden. And the Shah. And Israel. Sorry to break the news to you, but Castro and his story is so B Grade that it no longer merits a response, much less one that has been a total failure.	The US has done business with horrible people, much worse than the Castros. Castro and his issues are no longer the threat they once were and so they no longer deserve the efforts from the US that they once did.
13038880	Mr. Frank Calzon is equally disqualified in my books, for not holding a reputable, recognizable job in 30 years. His income derives from thousands of articles like this and similar venemous innuendos, divisive fabrications and plain lies, to justify his next pay period. The pain, suffering, blood and deaths that I have seen and endured since 1959 in Cuba, as a result of this unjustifiable. artificial divide, demands better from all of us. If the US could become allied with Germany and the horrors it committed in Buchwand and Treblinka, if Viet Nam has been willing to forgive our henious deeds, Chile have made peace with Pinochet torturers and Nelson Mandela gave the world the greatest lesson in forgiveness, why is it, the US, even with a President, who have seen abuse, segregation and marginalization first hand, continue doing the same and expecting a different outcome in Cuba?	There has been too much pain, suffering, and death since 1959 because of this divide. Other countries, such as Germany, Vietnam and Chile have had to reckon with much worse historical problems than the US and Cuba.
7057234	Wives should never speak at conventions or on national TV unless they are a salaried offical or employee in the administration. What they say is essentially dishonest and phony otherwise. But, more important, we desperately need to abolish the use of the term *First Lady*. We are not an aristocracy. The wife of the President has no official role and not a penny should be spent on an office, staff, her clothes, her trips, her hobbies or her press. When we have a woman as President (Clinton's speech last night was the kick-off the 2016 Hillary campaign) the absurdity of giving titles to spouses will be obvious. Enough of the *royal* Presidency. Michelle Obama is a terrific speaker and she should run for office. But until she does, she should keep quiet. ( Ann Romney as well) Let their husbands stand or fall on their own accomplishments.	Spouses of candidates should not speak at conventions unless they are an employee or official, because what they say is dishonest and phony. The US is not an aristocracy. The spouse of the candidate is not being elected and will have no official role in the administration.
7046664	It is possible that the spouse of a Presidential candidate, although educated and a professional, living a non-political independent life, would have nothing noteworthy to say about the campaign? A spouse could have strong opinions about numersous topics and insight into the character of one's spouse, but still not be in a position, or inclined, to opine on the relevant aspects of a Presidential campaign.	The spouse opinion may not be relevant to the campaign of the president.
7044185	i vote no, the wife can hurt her husband in ways that will go unnoticed, there are those who still believe that a wife should remain in the background, that she is not the one running for office ... i very much like the president and will vote for him again ....i will add that the the only exception for me was hillary clinton, by far the smartest most articulate politician in recent memory!! more together and harder working, too.... in fact, i voted for clinton because of his wife but i know of those who voted against him because of his wife	A wife can end up hurting her husband's campaign. The spouse is not the one running for office, even though I like the president.
7049483	I like to hear the wives speak. Knowing Michelle Obama's education/professional life, what I hear is: 'I'm Michelle Obama and I chose this man to be my husband -- so you think I'd pick a fool?' Knowing Ann Romney's background, I heard exactly what I would have expected: ' I'm Ann Romney and I chose a good provider.' I simplify, obviously, but hearing spouses talk does tell us things we should know about the men asking for our votes. My husband both reflects me and reflects on me.	The spouses are a reflection of the strength of the candidate, by how they chose to marry the candidate. Spouses can provide essential information about candidates that voters need to have. We should hear from candidate's spouses because my partner is a reflection of myself and candidates are the same.
13956677	"Unfortunately the new government has an agenda of welfare populism, suspicious to any kind of market-reforms and protective of vested interests." That is misleading. The new government is not protective of the elite vested interests that so wrecked Greece. It is protective of those who were harmed by auterity for thee but not for me. In the face of 25% unemployment (50-60% among youth) populist help is a necessary part of anything to be done. What would you do, let them starve? Reform the markets and let it work itself out would have been possible before it was so broken. Now, that is not sufficient. That time has past, that opportunity squandered.	The newest government throws welfare at its people and is against new market ideas. The government is not protective of vested interests, it is protected of those who were harmed by them. Unemployment rates are too high.
13961064	Mr. Lackman says Europe will not agree to end its disastrous austerity policies toward Greece for fear that they will have to do so elsewhere. That's a feature, not a bug. Austerity has been bad for Europe as a whole; it's led directly to the third recession in 7 years, and the risk of a long-term stagnation far below economic potential. The defiance by Greek voters should serve as a wake-up call not just for the Irish, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French, but for the Germans, Dutch and Finns as well: austerity is killing Europe, and should be abandoned immediately.	Austerity has caused recessions and a risk of long-term stagnation of Europe. Austerity should be abandoned right away because it is killing Europe.
13958896	"Continuing with the I.M.F.-E.U. imposed budget austerity measures risks condemning Greece to several more years of economic misery." Austerity hasn't worked, it isn't working and it ain't gonna work in several more years. At some point, of course, the Greek economy will recover, even carrying the burden of austerity. But as Maynard Keynes wisely observed, "In the long run we are all dead."	The imposed budget will lead to more misery. Austerity isn't working has not worked, and will not work in the future.
13958691	Forcing austerity on Greece has depressed the economy even further than it was, caused much human suffering and pretty much assured that the folks holding Greek debt will get less money that they would have otherwise. Perhaps it has worked as a morality play, but not as economics. This commentator is right, it'll be difficult for Syriza to do worse.	Austerity has caused suffering and worsened the economy.
13956896	Greece hasn't come to grips with the elites that have not only poisoned their country but ruined it. Syriza's defiance of the rest of Europe (though many countries in the south will try to emulate Greek intransigence) will be an enormous, even ultimate stress test for the European Union. If only the aid to Greece had gone to the people and not the banks and hedge funds that to be paid off, things would look different. Syriza takes a cheap route, blaming the Troika, the Germans. They do not change the corrupt Greek way of dealing with their own crisis. Even in Syriza there are many who will seek profit from Greek's demise. Just watch!	Greece has not dealt with the elitists who have lead to the ruination of their country. Syriza's defiance of Europe will test the allegiance of the European Union. The anti-austerity government did not change the corruption in the Greek system.
12763905	I'm constantly puzzled by the complete absence of any sense of irony in opinions offered by defense professionals. For example - "There is nothing new about NATO conducting operations and providing assistance to nonmembers of the alliance. Indeed, it is routine (Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya, et al)." Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya, et al are disaster areas now after NATO's ministrations. Libya, in particular, is as close to hell on earth as it gets. Again - "Too many countries in NATO are in hock to Russia economically, politically or otherwise, and fear "provoking" Moscow." They are also in hock to the US, ma'am, and fear provoking Washington.	NATO's ministrations did not help Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya. Libya is a hellish place.
12770824	This debater, and his opinion in this article, betray a very weak understanding of history. Nato expanded into the former Soviet Union long ago. The majority of the former Soviet Block eastern European countries are already part of NATO. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe, and potentially one of the Richest, if you do not count the European portion of Russia. Standing by, and not helping Ukraine to defended itself against Russia, would be wrong from national security, economic and moral points of view. Forcing Russia to expose itself as an extremely dangerous, immoral, and brutal country that no other country should trust, should be the minimum price Russia must pay to invade and occupy Ukraine. Send Ukraine arms, intelligence and money. Let them defend their own country, without a stacked deck.	NATO has expanded into former Soviet Union. Most former Soviet countries are in NATO. NATO should defend the Ukraine because it is wealthy and large. NATO should defend the Ukraine from Russia, on the grounds of national security, economics, and morality. Nonmember countries such as Ukraine must be protected from untrustworthy and potentially harmful countries like Russia. Supply Ukraine with support.
12762650	Based on the NATO charter - NO - but morally and as a question of ethics, I would like to see not just NATO, but the entire world jump up and kick sand back in Putin's face. Purely from the perspective of US politics, we still have more sanctions to play out, the requirement of a more serious commitment from the EU, and we can start to send arms if the sanctions fail. Speaking of US politics, let's not forget that the Immigration crisis, the Republican/Warhawk over-hyped faux ISIS crisis, and the mid-term elections, are all stealing the thunder from this serious Russian invasion of the Ukraine.	NATO is not required to defend nonmembers.
17015766	I've had cats since I was three years old, and I work in an animal shelter. I'm wondering what planet Dr. Hart is from. No, the vast majority of cats are not trainable in any way. And so what? If you worship your slipcovers, get a goldfish, and then reconsider what is important in life. If you're worried about your autistic child getting scratched -- and how many people does this apply to?? -- get a nice yellow lab. Then have a glass of wine. But do not mutilate an animal and leave it defenseless in order to allay your neurotic concerns.	It is inhumane to mutilate an animal and leave it with no defenses to simply make your life more convenient.
17012301	People should not adopt animals whose needs they cannot meet, regardless of what might seem beneficial to the children in the house. If a family for some reason needs a declawed cat, that family should adopt one of the many from a shelter rather than adopting an unaltered cat and declawing him to their convenience and his detriment.	People should not be allowed to adopt animals they don't have the resources to care for properly.
17024278	I have two cats that were either given to me or purchased that were declawed. It is a sad situation since they do not climb and can only jump a short distance. They usually do not cover waste in their litter pans and well who would after having this done to them. My cats do not go outside due to having limited ability to protect or fight off an attacker. I would not have this procedure done to my other cats as it takes away their nature instinct to scratch things. But, I do have several scratching posts that even the declawed cats will paw at.	Declawing your cat can understandably lead to them failing to cover their waste. Declawed cats have limited ability to protect themselves from an attacker. Declawing takes away a cat's natural instinct to scratch things.
17012311	I've had forepaws declawed for my indoor cats for almost 40 years with no problems. Good health, friendly behavior, near-perfect use of the litter box, no clawed furniture. My guess is that if they could choose, they would prefer that to euthanasia at the shelter.	It improves their lives and cats would rather be declawed than put down..
17009806	Here's some over-regulation to an absurd degree. There may be legitimate reasons for de-clawing. A responsible pet owner and a competent and compassionate vet should be left alone to make the right decision for each animal. If the pet owner is irresponsible and the vet is not competent, then there are way bigger problems at play than claws. Doesn't our legal system have enough to do without this nonsense?	Reasons exist for de-clawing cats so it should be legal. The decision to declaw a cat should be left up to owner and vet.
17091472	The publication cited by the author as evidence supporting his position that cats must be declawed is filled with so many errors I don't know where to begin. The Loss article has been routinely and thoroughly debunked as unreliable (statistical assumptions on estimates from dated studies, extrapolating those estimates, lack of accountability for population density in cat ownership in rural, suburban and urban environments where existence of land birds is diverse due to variation of vegetative coverage in human dominated environments, dominant predation territorial variation of wildlife in general, the unethical monetary support of the authors by organizations who support killing cats without a rational basis, etc.) in other words highly biased. As stewards of our environments, we must change our focus and pledge do no harm and we must adapt and change rather than exterminate or maim domesticated animals which simply is not rational or humane.	We need to pledge to do no harm, and we should adapt and change rather than exterminate or maim domesticated animals.
17090878	It's absolutely horrifying how people can defend this. There are no excuses to perform this kind of painful and unnecessary amputation on any cat, ever. If people in other countries are able to have cats, indoor and outdoor, without this kind of barbaric practice, there should be no reason for it to be somehow needed n the US. And the idea that allowing declawing decreases the number of homeless cats is laughable, considering the massive problem with stray cats in america, where many european countries where it's illegal have the problem under much better control. And ask any shelter if they never see any declawed cats, and the answer will usually be the opposite. Declawed cats are abandoned regularly because of the behavior problems they develop due to pain and lacking their natural defense. I'd like to recommend everyone who wants to understand the issue better to watch the documentary The Paw Project, which shows just how much this kind of amputation hurts cats, the consequences, and how many of them need another surgery to somewhat repair their paws after the declawings.	The concept of declawing and any attempt to defend the procedure is horrifying. It is painful and unnecessary to declaw a cat. People in other countries keep cats as pets and don't practice the barbaric ritual of declawing them. Declawing cats does not reduce the number of homeless cats. Declawing cats leads to alternate behavior problems cause by cat's pain and lack of natural defense.
17068275	I suspect that the cat is not too happy about being neutered either, but we do that for obvious reasons. If a cat is going to be exclusively an indoor kitty, and the alternative is the destruction of most of your furniture, then this seems a reasonable choice to me as a last resort. My parents left me with an entire house full of badly scratched furniture (including a Steinway grand piano!) thanks to not wanting to get their cat de-clawed. In their later years the cat often scratched them as well. The only caveat I would have is that if the cat ever gets out and runs away, it is probably doomed with no defense against wildlife, dogs, whatever. My own cats can go outside, and of course have their claws intact.	The cat isn't happy about being neutered, but it too must be done. It seems reasonable to declaw an indoor cat as a last resort to save your furniture.
17057400	Declawing prevents cat overpopulation? Doubtful. I was a vet tech prior to becoming an RN. I have been physcially sick twice in the last 10 years of those careers....both times were as a vet tech. Neve as an ER nurse! Once was a shot puppy, another was a post op declaw. It was HORRIBLE. But clearly, sir, you need an anatomy class. You see cats don't reproduce via claws....1 cat can have 30  offspring in the wild.....my cats have the option to go outside (where they were found- cold, starving, wet, fighting for their lives in city streets) they don't want to go outside!!!! Why would they?? And personally I would rather buy 15 couches than live without any of my fur babies. I can't even believe you were allowed to write this article, as you are terribly misinformed.	Declawing does not prevent overpopulation.
17017672	This man needs mental help. De-clawing a cat is NOT clipping her nails, it is cutting off part of the paw. It is painful, inhumane, and VERY often leads to biting and not using a litter box. Think about cutting off all your fingers at the first knuckle. That is de-clawing. It needs to be BANNED everywhere.	De-clawing is mutilation. Declawing is painful, inhumane and often leads to biting and refusal to use a litter box. It is simply as cruel as cutting off the first joint of your fingers.
17015769	I have a compromised immune system. If I could not adopt adult declawed cats, I could not have a cat. I've had three (two at the moment). They've all been different but not disturbed. They are great joys. If you oppose declawing, feel free not to declaw and not to adopt a declawed cat. If you want to campaign against declawing, go for it. But, do you really need the government to ban it?	My compromised immune system means I can only adopt declawed cats. Not wanting to declaw cats is a personal choice, and you can campaign if you want, but it should not be forced on all cat owners.
17014864	I have owned five cats (more accurately, they owned me) in my adult life, and every one has been declawed. Each cat was rescued from a shelter, three were under a year old, and our current two had lived in a no-kill shelter for three years before coming to our home. My vet sends the cats home the day following surgery with a pain patch on, and the cats are very comfortable yet able to jump onto furniture and use their litter box. The patch falls off in a few days, and life goes on. All of my cats have been spayed/neutered and indoor animals, no exceptions allowed, and they live long, happy, spoiled lives. It's okay to care about my cats and the way my furniture looks, too.	My cats were able to jump on furniture and use their litter box with the pain patch the vet gave them which then falls of on it's own after a few days. Declawed cats live lang happy lives. Cats and furniture can be valued equally.
17014431	I am not a believer in "animals' rights". Right to something is a concept developed by humans within their society. But I am against mutilating animals for their owners' convenience, such as declawing a cat, surgically severing the voice chords of a loudly barking dog, cutting horns of goats or trimming the wings of birds. Remember the Golden Rule of Ethics in one of its versions, "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself".	I'm against declawing cats, it's mutilation. The Golden Rule of Ethics should be remembered. One should treat their cat like they'd want to be treated.
17014181	My indoor cats love scratching stuff. Therefore we have scratching posts, cardboard scratching rectangles / circles / squares, next to every piece of furniture we care about. Cats almost never scratch on furniture as they prefer these things. Really, there's no reason to de-claw.	Scratching posts help cats maintain their claws. Cat's usually don't scratch on furniture anyway. A reason does not exist to declaw cats.
17014122	Bravo! cats with front claws often do terrible damage to furniture. While it is politically correct to object to it, the fact is there will be fewer homes for cats, who will end up being euthanized. The comparison isn't between an imaginary garden of Eden and declawing, but rather the choice is between more feral cats and more put down. Those of us who love cats don't want to see well-meaning humans decree that millions of cats suffer to meet the needs of humans.	Intact cats damage owners property. It is a moral thing, not a legal one. If cats are not declawed more will be killed for lack of homes. While well meaning, people who say that millions of cats suffer to meet our needs as humans are disingenuous.
17013118	When I adopted my precious cat about 20 years ago, the women who had rescued it were thrilled that I said it would be an indoor cat. Free to roam my fenced back yard as I watched her. When I asked my veterinarian if a declaw was OK she said it would be fine from a medical, procedural and moral stand point because the after affects would be fine and the cat would not be defenseless as an indoor pet. I went back to the rescue ladies who were strong animal advocates and they were supportive of my desire to declaw. So, it was done. My cat and I had ten great years together and her inability to scratch me when holding her or playing with her endeared her to me all the more. If an owner of a cat has a similar situation as I had, I'd say it's not up to the state to meddle.	My veterinarian informed me there would be no lasting effects from declawing my cat because indoor pets will not be left defenseless. The state should not dictate how owners should treat their pets. My cat was declawed and it made me care for her more.
17012985	Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Declawed cats are abundant in shelters. Declawing a cat causes NUMEROUS other behavioral problems. I have six cats and none of them are declawed, I trim their nails once a month and I have no problems with them ruining furniture. Educate people on how to care and train a cat instead of mutilating animals. Declawing IS a crime. PERIOD.	Declawing cats is inhumane and cruel and the process should be outlawed due to the high number of declawed cats in shelters. De-clawing can causes new issues. Declawing is a crime; instead, people should be educated on proper care and training.
17012940	Completely inaccurate. The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. "Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article.	Declawing is really amputating the toe, forcing the cat to walk on their phlanges, which are not meant to be fully weight bearing.
17012260	Declawing should be illegal. I think it is cruel and I have had this discussion with my vet. An animal should not be altered, I have a puppy mill rescue that has a cropped tail and no dewclaw and it was done by design and it is wrong. How can we say that we love animals and then pay and promote their cruel alteration. I have a cat with all his claws, which is the way it should be.	It should be illegal to declaw your cat. I think it should be illegal to declaw your cat. I have talked with my veterinarian and I think the practice is cruel. I have a puppy rescue with a cropped tail, it was wrong to alter him. It is cruel to declaw your cat if you love animals.
17012077	The top two reasons cats are turned into shelters are house soiling and aggression (biting). It is a well-known fact that declawed cats are deprived of their main form of defense (claws), and resort to biting. Additionally, it is painful for many declawed cats to dig in a litter box. Hence, house soiling. Shelters I have volunteered at have quite a few declawed cats come in due to these reasons, declawing being the source of these issues. Pet owners who want to declaw a cat should not have a cat--period. If you want to protect your furniture, do not own a cat. Cats naturally scratch. If dog owners don't want their animal to jump on their couches or beds, do they remove a dog's leg? If dog owners don't want a dog to bark, is debarking humane? It's the same thing as declawing a cat. Just don't have one.	The top reasons cats are given to shelters are that they aren't house trained and are aggressive. Declawed cats use biting as their main form of defense. Declawed cats have trouble using a litter box. Declawing is the source of issues which cause some cats to end up in shelters. Owners who want to declaw a cat, should not have a cat--period. Want to protect your furniture, don't own a cat. Cats naturally scratch. If owners don't want their dog jumping on their furniture, do they remove the dog's leg? If owners don't want a dog to bark, is debarking humane?.
17011720	I am from the UK where declawing is outlawed. I had never heard of a declawed cat and moved to the USA in 1999. After Hurricane Katrina, there were a surplus of cats and dogs for adoption at our local shelter. I adopted two cats not knowing that one had declawed front paws. It took away the defenses of the declawed cat against the cat with intact claws - though he did like to get the clawed cat in a headlock and scratch with his hind paws. If you don't like scratched furniture, cats are not for you. You have to deal with the whole animal, not just the parts you like.	My declawed cat was not able to protect himself effectively from an intact cat even though he was able to find alternative methods to try and make do. You should accept that cats scratch furniture.
17011337	There are, of course, exceptions but declawing is inhumane and unnecessary and should only be used as a last resort, if all. One of my cats always uses her scratching post and her cardboard scratchpad while the other one has no interest in using them. Occasionally, he will scratch at the sofa but we used double sided tape and that deterred him. He doe claw at some other pieces but we do not care, they' re not nice anyway and often, manipulative fellow that he is, he does it for attention. Education is key here, cats need to use their claws for defense and instinct, and cat caregivers need to provide appropriate scratching places. We all need to make compromises, use a cover for the sofa if the mess bothers you. We make allowances for our messy children. Mutilation and amputation for our convenience is just wrong.	Declawing cats is inhumane and unnecessary. They need to use their claws for defense and instinct. It is wrong to mutilate or amputate an animal because it's easier for you.
17010578	Declawing is unacceptable. A cat needs to go out a couple of times a day, just as we do, not least to relieve itself. Consequently, it needs to be able to defend itself against both feral and other tame cats that have not been declawed.	It is simply not acceptable to declaw a cat. Declawing cats leaves them defenseless.
17010541	Declawing is never a reasonable alternative,mutilating cats does not keep them in their homes just check any non kill animal shelter and see how many declawed cats have lost their homes for litterbox avoidance and aggression caused by the pain of those stumps. Note I said non kill shelters, in kill shelters declawed cats are routinely put to death immediately as unrehomeable because they no longer trust human beings and who can blame them? Declawing is despicable and it's people like you who are responsible for the millions of cats living in misery with sore stumps and claw regrowth. Owning a cat is a privilege not a right and if a person can't cope with a clawed cat then they have no business taking one into their home. It should be banned in the USA and Canada as it is in the rest of the civilised world.	There are other alternatives to declawing. Declawing cats does not prevent them from ending up in shelters because the mutilation causes many problems. Declawed cats are commonly put to death because they are hard to rehome. Declawing is wrong and can cause sore stumps and claw regrowth. A person who cannot deal with the realities of owning a clawed cat should not own one, as in the rest of the world.
17009879	I am against the practice, however outlawing it, I can't agree. I've clipped cats claws for years and trained all my cats to avoid the furniture. However, my Mom's pet was declawed at the advice of our Vet. This cat would scratched his face and nick his eye. I sucessfully healed four very bad eye ulcers. So bad the vet didn't expect us to get them healed. Before he injured his one of his eye's to the point of it being removed, the vet recommend we declaw him. Outlaw it and you remove options for good pet owners with highly unusual situations.	My mom's cat nicked his eye when scratching his face and her vet advised he be declawed. My cat should have been declawed to prevent injury to its eye. Making declawing illegal would limit options for cat owners and lead to less homes for cats.
17006831	A cat living in the wild needs its claws for climbing trees and for self defense. A pet cat kept indoors does not need its claws. If I have to keep a pet cat I would insist on declawing it. Otherwise I would forgo the pleasure of having a cat as a pet, no matter how cuddly.	Indoor cats do not need claws.
17006393	A person who cares more about their furniture than they do about their cat shouldn't have a pet in the first place. Any person who considers it ok to mutilate an animal to protect their three piece suite is a moral vacuum.	If a person cares more about their furniture than their cat, they should not have a pet. Declawing is mutilation and anyone who practices it is selfish.
17005695	Declawing is a horrible procedure. The cat is in excrutiating pain after afterwards and it is completely unnecessary. Get scratching posts; claw covers; use a squirt bottle with water;...all the declawing is because people who aren't cat savvy feel that their furniture is more important OR they don't like the sound OR they are scratched playing with the cat. This is a barbaric procedure. Those who implement it on their animals are not even remotely interested in the cat...it's all about what THEY want. Try having your fingernails removed people...see how you like it.	Declawing cats is inhuman o the animal. The cat will be in excrutiating pain and it is completely unnecessary. Declawing is barbaric.
9182291	Ridiculous. Myriad can have a patent on the techniques used to sequence a gene, a patent on the test used to detect the gene, but they cannot patent the gene itself. It's the equivalent of Newton patenting F=MA - it's a fact of the natural world that mankind has discovered, not something new mankind has created.	The human blueprint is part of the natural world and was not created by mankind.
9178967	According to Adam Mossoff: "But Myriad's patents don't cover genes in their naturally occurring, unisolated form, just as the aspirin patent did not cover chewable bark. Rather, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents claim the genes as isolated, purified and used in a scientific or medical context." But then the patents should still be invalid, because they would have failed the 'new "compositions of matter"' test. If I merely isolated and purified a chemical from its natural environment, I cannot yet claim to have _synthesized_ that chemical. I might be able to claim ownership of the process I would have used to isolate it, but I don't yet have ownership of the chemical. Myriad can choose to keep its _knowledge_ about the BRCA chemicals proprietary, but how could they be allowed to prevent someone from independently discovering equivalent knowledge about those chemicals from their natural settings?	Patents once they fail the "compositions of matter" test they should be invalid. If someone  takes a chemical from it's environment and purifies it, they cannot claim the chemical as their own. They can claim a patent on the process, but not the actual chemcial. Myriad can prevent the dissemination of their knowledge about BRCA chemicals but cannot prevent others from acquiring the same information about the chemicals from natural sources.
9177340	Mossoff is being quite disingenuous. He keeps talking about "identifying, isolating and purifying something." At a fundamental level, that is not what Myriad is patenting. They are in reality patenting the right to determine f the BRCA1 gene harbors a DNA sequence change that predicts breast cancer. It is not like insulin. A better analogy would be the presence or absence of a heart murmer. It would be like saying every time a cardiologist listens to your heart with a stethoscope and diagnosis a mitral valve problem, he/she must pay royalties. While Myriad may couch this in terms that suggests this is about "identifying, isolating and purifying something," that is not what this is about - it is about reporting something that is already either there or not there in one's body, the specific DNA sequence. It is not about isolating or purifying anything.	Would a cardiologist have to pay royalties when listening to your heart and diagnosing a mitrial valve problem. Companies should not be able to patent DNA sequences that already exist.
9182493	Every thing found in nature got to be by some kind of mutation and even engineered genes are now found in nature. The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.	Because genes have been patented anyone treating conditions of those fence have to pay the patent holders. Patenting genes inhibits innovations and blocks medical care. It is morally and ethically wrong to patent genes.
9183882	No they should not be able to patent a human gene. They didn't create it. The gene has been there all along. Certainly the company owns the testing mechanism they develop. If someone developed a technique to alter genes so they are not destructive to us, that method is theirs to patent. But the ownership of the gene belongs to the people who carry them.	Companies should not be able to patent a human gene. Companies did not create the gene. Genes belong to the people they are inside of.
9183640	Genes belong to the human race and other species. They should never be patented, owned or controlled by companies or governments or individuals. They belong in the public domain. They belong to everyone. They should never be used for profitable purposes. Margaret Nwton, MD	Genes belong to the human race or the given species. Genes are part of the public domain. Genes are public domain. Companies shouldn't profit off of genetics.
9180145	i absolutely do not think a company should be able to own my dna. I also do not think there can be a monopoly on it. their tests and modifications are different but every company should be able to work with and develop their own tests using any part of our dna to help save our lives. It is also disgusting that they are making it so expensive that most people will not be able to take the test. Companies get a lot of federal grants to do this research and that portion should belong to all of us and we should get a break in price.	Allowing companies to patent genes could produce a monopoly. Testing has become prohibitively expensive. Federally funded grant research belongs to the tax-payer.
7097021	The veggie and fruits at the supermarket have been scrubbed, plucked and waxed to be cosmetically perfect. And before landing in the produce section display cases they have been riding around in refrigerated tractor trailers for days and in some cases weeks --slowly oxidizing and losing precious nutrients. Why the devil would you want to eat this stuff? Buy local produce from the farmer's market instead.	Fruits and veggies that are non-organic are just as good. Before arriving at the store, the produce has already been riding around in transit, slowly oxidizing and losing nutrients. Food should be bought locally at farmer's markets.
7096784	Pesticides are inherently bad for one's health. Pay no credence to the Stanford study because it appears biased and probably funded by the likes of Walmart, Costco and Cargill. Genuinely Organic and Natural foods are healthier, and loaded with good nutritional factors and anti-oxidants	Pesticides are just naturally bad for you. The expense of Organic food is justified because they are healthier.
7097164	Mother Nature usually turns about to be doing things the right way before humans intervene with out own methods. Organic farming is much closer to the way Mother Nature farms. I'll assume it's better in the long run before I take industrial farming's word for it.	Organic food is worth it because natural is the best method for doing things. Organic food is better because Mother Nature would do it that way.
7094497	Conventional agriculture in the Midwest allows its fertilizers to wash into the neighboring streams. Conventional animal husbandry pollutes the Mississippi with manure. This waste of nitrogen and phosphorous has caused a loss of oxygen in a vast area of the Gulf of Mexico, killing off all the fish and the fishing industry in that dead zone. Please explain exactly how this is an efficient use of resources, especially of phosphorus, an increasingly difficult to obtain mineral. Organic farming strengthens the soil with compost, reducing runoff, and unites the animal and herbal branches. Finally, the reckless use of antibiotics, purely to promote growth, has been proven to foster antibiotic resistant bacteria. The impunity and political power of the farm lobby is displayed in the refusal to tally the quantity of any particular drug bought by a farm to the FDA. Many people will die of disease thanks to these farmers.	Conventional agriculture allows fertilizers to wash into streams and pollutes rivers with manure. Organic farming is good for the soil in several ways. Overuse of antibiotics causes resistant bacteria to grow.
7093361	The Stanford study revealed many issues. Having read newspaper articles about it ,brought me to the conclusion like many issues we pursue with herd mentality, Organic products may have just been a good marketing scheme. I kind of compare it to Drug manufacture advertising, after FDA approval, as if we all of a sudden we have a simple solution to complex problems. Drugs like organic produce, usually turn out to be questionable. Both cattle and humans are full of Antibiotics, problem is we consume meat from cattle. If feed lots don't protect cattle from disease they would cost us more as many would be sick and bring less profit when butchered. Point is Organic food is all about making money. Few people have the space or time to grow anything. We delegate those duties to corporate farming so it shows up nicely packaged at the supermarket with a label few can understand. I found people were not fooled by organic foods and drug raised cattle and chickens just confused many times.	Organic products are a scam. Organic produce, like drugs, is likely questionable. Feed lots don't protect cattle from disease and they would be sick and cost customers more. Organic food seeks only to make money. All foods come from the same farms.
7093338	When I visit NY, I spend time on the North Fork of Long Island, known for its many conventional wineries. The landscape is beautiful. Now, if there are no benefits to organic farming, how come so many of the vineyards have huge signs with skull and crossbones that say: "do not enter, pesticides are dangerous"? Every time I pass by I wonder about the high incidence of breast cancer in Long Island, and I wonder about the farm workers working on the vines, and I wonder about the need to post these signs if it is all so very safe.	Eating organic foods is healthier and expensive but i live longer. Organic farming is worth the cost because pesticides are dangerous.
7192051	While the government wants us to eat healthy, it is very true that organic foods are outrageously priced for the small amount of food we recieve. Yes, when going to McDonald's and getting 5 things off of the dollar menu you get more bang for your buck. However, that is one reason why America is in such bad shape literally and figuratively. Obviously organic products are healthier for you than genetically enhanced ones. The cows that produce the normal milk we drink are fed steroids to be able to produce more milk than naturally possible. Therefore, we are not consuming 100% pure milk. That can cut down the natural nutrients we would be recieving if everyone housed their own cow. So, this article couldn't be any more incorrect by saying that America is worse off consuming organic products. If everyone decided to trade out a bag of Lay's for some all natural vegetable chips, consumption sizes would be cut down and health could be improved.	Organic food is worth the expense since cows that produce regular milk are given steroids that can inhibit the natural nutrients that are available in organic milk. Health could be improved with effort.
7097300	Knowing that a combination of 33 pesticides are sprayed on the average apple makes me feel ill. An apple a day will keep the doc away from eating the apple! The dirty dozen list needs to be more publicized. I would rather spend more for the imperfect but pesticide free apple. The question is "How much pesticide can the human body take before the immune system is overtaxed and cancer cells are no longer eliminated from the body? Our bodies are not meant to filter out such chemicals.	Currently, regular produce has a combination of 33 pesticides sprayed on it, that is unappetizing. Eating a pesticide free apple is worth the cost. The human body can only handle so many pesticides before the immune system is overtaxed. Continuing to eat chemically manipulated foods is bad for the human body, which struggles to eliminate these foreign substances.
7096050	I have bought organic food and have never noticed that it tasted any better than the non-organic variety. I just paid more for it. Organic food is found in large supermarkets, whereas better food is found in local market with local produce. Plus I never got sick from either one - more important is the country it comes from. I avoid anything from Mexico. I just think Organic food is over-hyped and over-priced. It is not worth the extra money.	Organic food doesn't taste any better, but costs more. Local produce in local markets is better. Organic food is too expensive and not worth the buzz.
19946137	The actual choice is between global government control of the internet or global business control of the internet. During the past 18 years, businesses have dominated the internet and repeatedly attempted to assert a new form of law that supersedes all national constitutions and law. Key issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property, and employment are at stake. Only the US Government's continuing presence at a distance has prevented the net from becoming an international kleptocracy. Only governments are rooted in law. They should govern the internet.

19949061	I think we would be kidding ourselves if we tried to prevent the transition to a multi stakeholder system for Icann. If we try to stop the proposal, the rest of the world will create an alternative domain name management system.

18554051	I've always enjoyed watching the Olympics. It's an opportunity, albeit a huge spectacle, to remind us that we're all on the same planet, where we can compete on the field with sport, not war. Brazil is one of my favorite countries, with a rich culture and a special joie de vivre not found in many other places. It's unfortunate and sad that their political problems have brought the situation to where it is now....but, political corruption is not really anything new, and not limited to Brazil. I've lived for years in dangerous mosquito zones (zika, chikunguniya, dengue, malaria) and stayed healthy by taking preventative measures. Olympic goers need to be educated about how best to prevent mosquito bites, the place needs to be sprayed, and an easy test people should be readily available for people returning home. Furthermore, the Olympics represent the dream of a lifetime for all the athletes who train so hard to get in. Let the games go on!	It unites the countries of Earth by allowing us to compete against each other. Brazil has a rich culture and way of life. Political issues have been going on throughout time and are not, and do not only happen in Brazil. The Olympics should not be postponed,I have lived in areas where mosquitoes are a threat and preventative measures suffice. People attending the Olympics need to learn how to avoid mosquitos. The Olympics are a dream for many athletes since they train extremely hard.
18546714	I have lived in Brazil for the last five years (and off and on over the last 27 years). I know of no one here who is even remotely excited about the Olympics. It would seem that people don't care. The economy is tanking and government is at a complete standstill. We have more important things on our mind right now.	I don't know anyone who is excited or cares about the Olympics happening.
18544990	The Olympics in Brazil is a joke, do this in a city where they are killed 6000-7000 people per year and kills crime.Se much more here than in Afghanistan (which is at war and has cars bomb every day). ... but it is the fault of our people, because we do not charge anything from the rulers, and the manifestations of the streets are all articulated by the press, making the exit of President Dilma second blow to the democracy of our country .... without health , jobs and an institutional crisis without prededentes, this Olympiad is another way to get people's attention from the bad things of our country	The Brazil Olympics can't be taken seriously.
18540583	The games should proceed. Athletes have made tremendous sacrifices to qualify and be prepared. It would be cruel to deny them their chance. In the future the Games should be held in countries within the top say 15 GDP per capita.	The games in Brazil shouldn't be postponed. Some athletes have spent huge amounts of time preparing for this event, it would be a shame for all of that work to go to waste.
18540371	My concern is purely in regards to the safety and health of the game participants. Based on the numerous articles in the NYT and other leading media organizations the safety and health of the participants is at risk. I understand the commitment of the athletes and Brazil but risk is not worth the reward IMO.	Brazil should postpone the Olympics for the health and safety of game participants. The safety and health of the participants are at risk. The risk of Zika outbreak is not worth holding the Olympics.
18540339	Delaying the games in Rio and making an international push to beef up Brazil's public health infrastructure--with a particular focus on mosquito-borne illnesses like Zika--would use the Olympic spirit and massive media power for a brilliant purpose. And holding the games instead next summer as Rio 2017 would forever memorialize an international success story, and ensure that Brazil is not punished for the misfortune of the Zika outbreak.  # OlympicPublicHealth	Olympic games should be delayed and media focus on mosquito-borne illnesses. Holding the games next summer in Rio would memorialize an international success story. Postponing the Olympics would punish Brazil for the Zika outbreak.
18550135	Thank you, Dr. Williamson. This gross spectacle not only does nothing to serve people, except those with money (usually lots of it), it diverts attention from human suffering. Those who pay small fortunes to attend these phony extravaganzas should be ashamed of their presumption. Those who spend days watching them on television should be ashamed of their shallowness.	The Olympics is a spectacle that serves only the rich and diverts attention from human suffering.
18546949	Brazil's political and economic problems are no reason to postpone or cancel the games. While the non-political ideal of the Games has never actually existed, canceling the games at this late stage would only make things more political. And as for conditions on the ground, most of the (very real) damage that Dr. Williamson points out has already been done. The Zika virus is another story. It's too early to confidently predict the course of the epidemic. In a couple of months, it may be a lot better, with public health officials finding good ways to protect travelers (and their communities back home who they might then infect). Or it may be a lot worse. If a scientific consensus emerges that the Games are likely to be a public health disaster (and the jury is still out), then the 2016 Games will need to be postponed, or canceled outright.	The political and economical problems of Brazil shouldn't impose on the games. Postponing the Brazilian Olympics would  politicize something that should not be political. The damage that the author warns about has already been inflicted. Zika virus is too early to predict the course of the epidemic.
18553740	With the Zika virus raging in Brazil, who wants to go there for the Olympics and end up sick with Zika. I think the game should be postpones or moved to another location out of a disease zone. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would want to go to Brazil with an epidemic raging. I will be surprised if attendance is not quite low. It is too risky, from a health point of view to go to those games.	People do not want to go to Brazil for the Olympics and contract the Zika virus. The Olympics should be postponed or moved out of a disease zone. There is an epidemic in Brazil. From a health standpoint, it is too risky to go to the Olympics.
18551463	How about this idea? Tell Rio we'll postpone their hosting for four years until 2020, so the Zika problem can be sorted out. Then for 2016, go ahead with the Olympics, but split the hosting among a variety of countries that can each host one or more sports. And bring it all together virtually via TV, which we kind of do anyway.	Rio should postpone the Olympics until the Zika problems is sorted out.
18547742	It's a corner of paradise, tainted by some of the worst pollution on Earth. We should have insisted that it was cleaned before an Olympic bid was considered. The games will happen as scheduled, nothing we can do about it now. But in reality, the place should have been cleaned before the games were awarded.	A corner of paradise, tainted by some of the worst pollution on Earth.
18546160	I think I'd find it a little bit redundant to postpone them entirely. Unfortunately I'm still a little salty my hometown wasn't picked, but nonetheless Brazil does and will have its problems. Postponing the olympics won't change that. If they could somehow be relocated to a more suitable location, I'd be fine with that (wink)	It's redundant to postpone them. Brazil's problems won't go away if they postpone the Olympics.
18541016	Holding the games in Brazil is pure insanity. Zika and dengue fever are out of control. The Olympic committee expects swimmers to compete in an open sewer. Participants and fans will be risking their health, and the health of their families and even their future children, to attend these games, and also risk the health of their home countries upon return. All so that NBC & the olympic committee can make big bucks. It's not worth it.	The Olympics should be postponed because of ZIka and dengue fever concerns. The swimmers shouldn't have to swim in toxic water. Attending the Olympics will risk the health of participants and fans as well as their families and entire countries.
5474672	Home school is good thing. I've had great success in the classroom at the college level with home school students. Sports is not academics. There seems to be some value in permitting home school students to play sports from the social development perspective. As far as competition is concerned. A more appropriate mix of academics and competition is interscholastic speech competition (forensics and debate) and chess. These activities mix competition and academics much better. In fact, I believe funding for the above activities should be equal to sports. They also serve title nine objectives and should be counted as interscholastic competition activity, just like sports in competitive activity with some thinking taking place.	Sports are not academics. Sports can help home-schooled children improve their social skills. Mixing academics and competition is good for all students.
5477790	School sports teams should consist of kids who attend that school, not those who are home schooled or who attend private schools. Home schooling is a choice and choices have consequences. There are kids sports leagues not affiliated with any school (at least here in California) and those are the leagues home schooled kids should be playing for.	School sports teams should only have players who attend the school. Home schooling is up to the parents, and is a choice with consequences. Home schooled children can participate in non-affiliated sports leagues.
5477405	Nick, homeschooled kids are part of society. They just don't go to public school, same as private school kids. In my state, the state athletic organization that oversees high school sports created guidelines for homeschooler participation in high school sports. They must meet academic and other requirements that enrolled kids must meet, but as long as they do, they are eligible. The overseeing organization realized that excluding homeschoolers was indeed discriminatory, and set about creating a system within which they could participate. In other states, there are laws on the books that require schools to allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities. My daughter was very involved in sports, and very talented at it, and she took advantage of both elite leagues and her high school teams (she was an enrolled student, not a homeschooler). The elite leagues are available to those who can make the teams, true, and most serious athletes participate in them. It's the lack of programs for the average kid after the age of 14 that's a problem. Also, even those who can make the elite teams can't always afford the fees.	Kids that are homeschooled are still people. It is right for home-schoolers to play for high school sports teams if they meet the same academic and other requirements for enrolled kids. In some states, there are laws that require school to allow homeschoolers to participate in activities. Many sports leagues are available for students who can make them especially if they are serious.
5475006	It seems to me home schoolers willfully separate themselves from the community to a certain degree. If they wanted to benefit from the community, such as participating in public school student activities, then maybe they shouldn't be trying to remain separate from it.	Their desire to separate themselves from the educational community should also separate them from student activities.
5518992	i agree with these article because home-schooled children should have the right to play sports and venger into sports that they like. they should be allowed to play in sports teams to not only be active and do something they like but to also socially inneract with teamates. it would give them an oppurtunity to enjoy the sports and company of others around them. they pay school tax funds so they should have the right to play school sports and have a chance to further their abilities in the sport of their choice. just like tim tebow they chould become sports stats as well. why give up a chance like that?	Home-schooled children should have access to sports as well as public school children. Playing with high school teams allows home-schoolers to have more social interaction. Home schooled kids could enjoy sports and company of others around them. They have paid for the right through taxes and deserve the chance to further their athletic abilities.
5492849	when kids are homeschool they dont interact with people as much as a public school kid would. I think thats a really good idea. If every public school had that program that would give kids a chance to get to know kids that like football and that are from differnt cultures.	Home schooled children do not interact with other students as much as non home school children. Home-schoolers should play for high school teams because it would allow such kids to get a chance to interact with other kids who like football and are from different cultures.
5490554	It amazes me that what is best for children seems not to be part of this discussion. Why wouldn't we want as many children as possible to be able to participate in high school athletics? We all know the benefits of sports for kids, why would we want to deny home-schooled kids these same benefits just because they are doing their academic work outside of the classroom?	All children should be able to participate in sports. We should not deny home-schooled kids the benefits of playing sports just because they are doing their academic work outside of the classroom.
5481449	I think not. They and their parents make the decision not to be a part of the classroom experience. Those reasons do not disappear after class. Team sports is just that, being a part of the team. That means being in the Class Room, in the school activities. Showing up for practice and the games is only a small part of being a team player.	Parents have made the choice not to be involved with public schools. Being part of a team is more than practice and games.
5481112	Well, I think the home schoolers who live in my nearby neighborhood should be able to get together and form their own Homeschooler Hornets team and then play the Homeschooler Hamsters across town. To let them play against a real high school team would then open the door for them to ask for helmets and shoulder pads to be provided at no cost to them, school bus transport to their games, etc.	Homeschoolers should be self-reliant and organize their own leagues. The home schooler might want the school to pay for their gear and transportation.
5477994	My daughter would LOVE to be able to opt in and out of classes at the Virginia public high school she attends. Personally, I would LOVE to be able to pull her out of certain classes and get her tutored in them or some such. But that's now how it works. If her high school is not good enough for these kids to attend, then they have no business being there playing sports. It is not a cafeteria, you don't get to pick and choose what you do and do take off the tray. Why don't we just take team sports out of the schools and make them a separate institution? Certainly a lot of the folks who are gung ho on their local high school football and basketball programs don't give much of a damn about the academics of those students anyway so long as they can have a winning team. Let's set up something elsewhere and let the rest of our kids concentrate on getting an education that will enable them to do something besides playing sports!	Why should kids be able to play at a school that they feel is not good enough to learn at?. Those choosing to home school should not be allowed to just take what they want from public education.
5477731	Where do we go with this? If families who don't believe in public schools can enjoy the athletic privileges, why not someone who doesn't believe in education period? Why shouldn't a dropout be able to play football? Or, for that matter, someone who wants to attend one school but wants to play ball at another? The far right loves to rail at what they see as narcissism and elitism, but they never recognize it in themselves. This is a matter of someone opting out of the community effort, stating by their actions that they are better than the riffraff, yet demanding participation in the only thing that they think the public schools are good at. These people are basically saying to the community, "You aren't smart, you aren't good enough to teach my kid, but I will admit that you are good at athletics, so we want in on that part of it." If this doesn't disgust you, fine, no one's gonna die. But it is yet another reminder that we will never be a community as long as groups of people don't want any part of a shared effort.	Families who don't believe in public schools may enjoy athletic privileges, why not someone who doesn't believe in education?. The parents should not be able to reject the public school system and then demand the athletics system for their use because they like that part. Home schoolers are not part of the community.
5477096	Why would a kid who attends a public school and plays for one of its teams want to, or have to, give up a spot on the roster, or even their position, to a kid who doesn't attend their school? Why would a team of kids who may have played together, hung out together, studied together, taken the school bus together, eaten lunch together, for a number of years want to welcome a kid who they may only see at practice onto their team? Why shouldn't a talented kid who goes to a school with particularly weak athletic program and/or facilities be able to join a team from a school in another part of the city or county that has a great athletic program and/or facilities? Should public schools be allowed to set up a draft for home-schooled free agent athletes? And so on.	A public school student who plays on a team could be forced out of his position or off the roster by a home school student. A homeschooled child won't be a part of the social group because they are not a part of the entire school life. If home schooled children get to pick a high school sports team high school kids will want to be able to play for other schools.
5476726	Yes, Steve. That's just how it works. My kids have been part time enrolled students at the local high school. They've taken chemistry and French, theater and music. They've been in marching band, color guard, acting, and chess teams as homeschooled kids. Homeschooling means the parents determine what educational tools best serve the interests of their kids. Savvy school districts happily include home educated kids when they can facilitate that education. It's worked wonderfully for us, in West Chester Ohio.	School should facilitate sports education for home-schoolers. Has worked  quite well in West Chester Ohio.
5475830	Seems it would be good for the children of folks who have rejected being a part of society to be exposed to the children of normal people no matter how it happens. Being brought up in the paranoid bunker without exposure to the outside world can lead to a warped world view. There were things I did not like about our public schools but the kids will have to swim in the big pond sooner or later. Better they learn to do it sooner.	It would offer homeschooled children a chance to be exposed to wider branches of society. Great experience for home-schoolers to navigate in the bigger world.
5474728	This idea is absurd. If a child's parents choose to home school him or her, that seems a clear choice to remove one's family from the life of the school, including its extracurricular programs. How about the home-schooled students play on teams of home-schooled students? Or perhaps individuals could compete in solo sports against other home-schooled individuals. Their parents could make the effort to create their own league, or have their children participate in community-based or private recreational or competitive leagues. The taxpayer argument does not hold water. People without children-as well as commercial property owners who live outside the district where their business is located-must pay local property taxes without receiving the benefits of sending their own children to that school. Moreover, as far as I know, most schools' indoor facilities (libraries, gyms, pools, and so on) are not open for the general use of taxpayers who live within the boundaries of particular school systems. Outdoor tracks are probably the exception.	Children who are home schooled should not be allowed to selectively participate in school activities, like extracurricular programs. Everyone else must pay taxes into the school system whether they use it or not and if they do not they receive nothing in return. Home-schoolers and other residents not enrolled in the public school are not be permitted to use schools' indoor facilities.
5480877	I was home-schooled, and so I sympathize with the plight of home-schoolers without adequate athletic competition. However there are at least two strong arguments against home-schoolers' inclusion (and against the tax payer argument) that none of the debaters brought up: 1) Private school families also pay taxes and yet may not try out for public school teams 2) Public schools only get funds based upon enrollment. Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken? I suppose the only reason it's even considered is the opportunity for competitive advantage to the school. If they were demanding inclusion in art class, I doubt it would be on the table.	Public schools earn their funding by the number of students who are actually enrolled, therefore, anyone who doesn't enroll should not get to use services paid for with that money.
5477919	Home schooled young people should be allowed to participate in after-school activities in their home district school, but I fail to see the relevance of the fact that their parents pay local taxes. In most communities a majority of taxpayers have no children in grades 7-12 and thus no participation in after-school activities.	Although they do not learn in the classroom they should be able to participate in after school activities.
5475255	People make a choice to send their kids to public school private school or to home school them. I'm all for it. I'm also all for people making a decision and living by it. No public school? No public school sports, social events, etc. Part of being an adult is knowing that making choices does not include "all I want is all there is".	If you didn't go to a public school you shouldn't get to participate in there sports or events. Adults should know that making choices doesn't mean that all you want is all there is.
5474645	It does not matter that parents who home school may pay just as much into the school system as other families. People without children pay as well and don't think this authorizes them to use the library or recreational facilities. In addition, supporting a school is not just about paying taxes. Parents who home school because they don't think public schools are good enough for their offspring weaken the very fabric of the public school system and should not seek to benefit from it. If it's not good enough for English and Math, it's not good enough for sports. (Of course, this should not apply to children who are home schooled because of special needs.)	School support does not just come from tax dollars. Parents who withdraw their children from public school because they think it's not good enough end up weakening the system and therefor should not benefit from it. If the parents do not like the way the schools operate they should not be allowed to take what they do like.
5483718	There are layers upon layers of sports organizations that accommodate home schooled kids - high school varsity should not be one of them. These kids have the opportunity to compete athletically in local recreation leagues, travel teams, AAU teams, and elite regional teams. High school sports should be about building athletic excellence and also about developing a sense of pride and comraderie in a placef that's that's truly the center of their existence for 4 short years. After all, should we then allow kids in private schools, boarding schools, or local religious schools to compete for varsity spots in their local public school? After they all pay taxes, but what do the school colors really mean to them?	Many layers of sports organizations accommodate home schooled kids. Home schooled kids can compete in local, travel, AAU, and elite sports leagues instead. High school is an important place for 4 years and it is about the pride and camaraderie of those attending. Like private school, boarding school, and religious school students, home schooled students might pay taxes, but the school colors are not meaningful to them.
5477940	The main reason educators argue against home schooling is because it works. It works so well, they have designed the system to work against the parents who chooses to become a primary educator to their own children. The legislators' should embrace the parent's decision and remove legislative road blocks that would hinder and disrespect a parent's unique role in their children's lives. I believe this is called progress in the right direction. One way to overcome this obstacle with sports would be a standardized test that would allow public and homeschooled students to participate in all extra curriculum activities without any bias or discriminatory practices. As it is now, home schooled students are being discriminated against.	Homeschooling is a unique role for parents in their children's lives and there shouldn't be laws that punish those who choose to go that path. Standardized testing can be given to allow both public and home schooled children to play sports together without any bias towards anyone. Home schoolers are discriminated against when they can't play sports.
5475504	In previous times the Virginia High School League did not let black high school students play sports. It is interesting that it took 16 years after Brown vs. the Board of Education to integrate schools. Perhaps homeschoolers may be able to overcome the prejudice as well. 24 States currently permit homeschoolers to participate in high school sports. If the Virgnia High School League had its way perhaps black athletes would not be in high school sports now.	If they play for high school team maybe they can overcome the prejudice of being home schooled. Homeschoolers should play sports because 24 states already allow that.
5477663	How about children who live in the district but attend private schools? Should they be allowed to play? What if their private school doesn't have a football team, or they don't make the team? Presumably their parents pay taxes; should they get to try out for the public school team? Home-schooled children do NOT attend the school. It is a school team. They should not participate. Should home-schooled children get to participate in the spelling bee, robotics club, science olympiad? in Michigan, public schools receive a certain amount of money for each child who enrolls, not a lump sum based on how many parents pay taxes. These schools should not have to use their budgets to pay for opportunities for children who are not enrolled and, therefore, do not bring dollars to pay for their education or other opportunities the school provides.	Since it is a school team, home-schooled children should not participate. If children aren't enrolled in the school and bringing financial gains to it, they should not be permitted to play sports there.
6038523	To JeffB Well, Rachel raised great questions that got attention - great. This is what this debate is about. I am quoting you: "Controlling prostitution at the level of the prostitute is like controlling drugs at the level of the junkie." This statement (on the GRE or LSAT) would not pass a stress test on logic, regardless of sides, as there is a missing correlation - business of prostitution similar to business of drug trafficking (missing piece). Great focus on demand! So, we get help for the junkie, indeed. All addicts need help for the addiction, including the sex junkie. So, do we legalize prostitution so the level of sex addiction that will always be with us becomes abundantly clear? No - because the consumption of women, as flesh and blood drug, is a form of cannibalism. Not all of us against prostitution are of the 'Christian majorities' - some of us survived serial killers and are trying to get a word out. Imagine that.	Controlling prostitution is like controlling drugs to the junkie. All addicts need help for the addiction, including the sex junkie. Do we legalize prostitution, so sex addiction that will always be with us?. The consumption of women is a form of cannibalism.
6040526	So does the article suggest that if a woman chooses to work as a prostitute, then working conditions will improve? So much of what we're learning about prostitution is that it is a job that is forced upon a woman/girl for financial gain, and that the prostitute is not the one who fully benefits from the money.	Prostitution is not any safer when it is legal.
6040313	I am currently a legal prostitute at the Moonlite Bunnyranch. Making prostitution legal everywhere would help to decrease not only the spread of STD's and help stop sex slavery. Laws making prostitution a crime aren't stopping people from entering the sex industry, regulation is truly the only answer.	Legal prostitution will lead to a reduction in STD's and make sex slavery more difficult it has been shown that legality does not stop the sex industry from existing.
6039744	Prostitution is harmful and dehumanizing and encourages modern day slavery which is Human trafficking. If legalized, we will be providing a much larger opportunity for traffickers to exploit more victims. This is what many people do not understand and need to be educated in.	Prostitution is harmful, dehumanizing, and encourages modern day slavery. Legalized prostitution opens the doors for sex trafficking.
6039591	Should be legal. Sex work - oldest profession - is not going away. Reduces AIDS and STDs when controlled. Half the celebrities are sex workers of sorts selling their bodies so why not the ones who actually have sex be allowed. Not everyone wants to do that. It has a strange effect on the psyche of women. An act made for bonding and love done with people you dont like - messes with the mind.	Prostitution has been around a long time, and will not go away. It reduces STD's. Half of the celebrities sell their bodies so it should be legal to actually sell sex.
6038024	On the island of Curacao legal prostitution has been there since I was a tiny toddler there (60 years now). That place, Campo Alegre (or Happy Place), was always bussy and always gleaming reports from indeed happy locals and tourists (Americands included - they were more than just happy; they went nuts). No diseases and within walking distance from the airport. Same health security in places like Amsterdam, Hamburg, etc. Grow up America.	Campo Alegre had booming business and wonderful reviews from Americans. It should have the same health security as places like Amsterdam and Hamburg.
6039608	I strongly disagree with the author's characterization of prostitution, but strongly agree with the author's suggestion of what to do about it. Prostitutes are most certainly allowed to say no to unwanted sex. It is only because the current system within which prostitution operates has so disempowered prostitutes -- leaving them vulnerable to both their clients, their employers, and the law -- that their wishes are so easily disregarded. If the prostitution laws were reversed so that it is the johns and the pimps, not the prostitutes, who commit the crime, then prostitutes would have much greater power to avoid unwanted sexual contact and violence, and perhaps a much better chance of getting out of the business altogether.	Prostitutes have a choice as to whether to have sec. The current system causes prostitutes to be unable to control their work and safety.
6066271	I believe working in a legal brothel cuts down on violence and abuse.Here we are safe and here by choice.People that come here are also safe we are tested weekly and all sex is protected and safe.In a legal establishment keeps girls off the streets and away from abusive pimps. I have been working in a legal brothel for about 6 months and I am happy here.	Workers in legal brothels are safe and there by choice where violence and abuse are minimized. Legal prostitutes are tested providing a safer interaction. Legal establishments reduce the dangers of prostitution. Working in a legal brothel makes prostitutes happier.
6039095	We've seen how a wild west approach with no laws works - abused children and adults get exploited. At least with a legal system there are some checks and balances to protect the workers, satisfy demand, and ensure a safe work environment for adults. With a legal path, there's an incentive to play by the rules. Those who continue to operate outside of the laws - the traffickers and child abusers - have less cover from the laws and those who enforce them.	Abused children and adults get exploited under a "prostitution is illegal" regime. Prostitution being legal only stops arrest not diseases and murderers. Legalization of prostitution will bring order to an uncontrolled system.
6037743	Legalizing prostitution and cracking down on trafficking are not mutually exclusive. The increased traffic in Amsterdam comes from the fact that it is just one such city and attracts men from all over. If prostitution was legal in every country in Europe this would not happen. Does prostitution dehumanize women? Absolutely. But until we get rid of it, legalization does, in theory, offer protections that doesn't currently exist.	Legalizing prostitution will not necessarily reduce trafficking. if prostitution were legal all over Europe there wouldn't be so much traffic to Amsterdam for prostitution. By legalizing prostitution, it can provide safeguards and protections.
6037518	Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).	Because prostitution has been illegal, it tends to be dominated by often violent pimps. Legal prostitution will over time remove the violence and criminal element.
6036521	"Numerous studies show that between 70 percent and 90 percent of children and women who end up in commercial sex were sexually abused prior to entry." The author seems to imply that if there were no sex workers, all of these people would not have suffered abuse. The problem of abuse came before the activity of prostitution. Abuse leads to prostitution, not the other way around. Banning prostitution will do nothing to prevent abuse, and abuse is the real problem, not commercial sex. I see no valid argument that legalizing prostitution would prevent prior abuse of women and children. It could be bettered argued that if there were legal outlets for sexual urges, cases of abuse would decline.	Abuse will exist even without legal prostitution. Prostitution doesn't lead to abuse, it's the other way around. Banning prostitution does nothing to prevent the real problem, abuse. Abuse could decline if prostitution were legal.
12418818	The unacknowledged advantage of privileging 'starchitects'' over the local talents is that the first come with a set of standards, a rigorous vocabulary and a name that prevail over the compromises usually inherent in a developer-driven culture (cost cuts, value-engineering, the client's 'taste', etc. - whatever could damage a project from the design phase to the actual built outcome). If one looks objectively, disregarding personal taste, whether it is a Gehry, a Nouvel or Isozaki building here in New York - they all stand out as impeccably executed architecture. Most of them relate to their context (see the formal empathy between the Beekman Tower and Woolworth Building, for instance), or creating a new one where such context is either weak or lacks character. It is a welcomed fad that reinstates the lost 'edge' New York once had, and subliminally educates both the developers' taste and the local crop of professional talents. Why should we be afraid of that?...	Starchitects adhere to a more rigorous set of industry standards than do local architects. If you don't judge by personal taste, New York has amazing architecture. Starchitects are a welcomed fad that reinstate the lost "edge" New York once had.  Starchitects educate both the developers' taste and local professional talents.
12412641	Having left NYC many years ago, I eventually came to live in a city of 40,000 that through the generosity of a patron secured the talents of the mid 20th century 'starchitects' and prominent firms. Today this small city and its architectural treasures is an international destination for those interested in architecture. Other than the large cities, where else can you find a collection of work by Saarinen, Venturi, Pei, Meier, Polshek, Stern, S.O.M., Pelli, Weese, Gwathmy, Barnes, The Architects Collaborative and sculptors like Henry Moore, Jon Tinguely, Chihuli. Obviously, none were local.	A small city with architectural treasures can become an international destination for architecture aficionados. Work from the Architects Collaborative and sculptors, which includes many well-known names, have enhanced large cities.
4063723	I am a retired HS media specialist and I am still asked all the time to help people find things on the Internet. My HS age granddaughter needs help evaluating reference material. Example: Why not depend on Wikipedia only? Libraries and the Internet work together and a library can't exist on its own. Without a person in the facility to keep it going and to teach students its value, it will die. Teacher or media specialist is not the issue. We need to support public education fully. That means teachers, the arts, sports, and the Media Center.	Libraries need faculty to teach it's value to students to keep them open.
4062443	As a former network and radio communications specialist for the U.S. Army and a small network administrator, I believe that I can say with confidence that I agree, eliminating librarians so that they can be replaced by technology is a gross diseconomy. First, the school board must be forgetting about the fixed costs of maintaining a library. Second, there is a complete neglect for the fact checking costs. Third, current technology costs are prohibitive; the school board's enthusiasm about the power of technology, though understandable, is misplaced. Then, there are the children themselves to be considered. What level of confidence will these children be able to have in the integrity of their resource material without a person to person interaction that will be able to uncover the specific focus and the nature of the child's, or the adolescent's, inquiry. That alone should be reason enough to reconsider.	School boards may forget about maintenance costs for libraries. The costs to replace school librarians with technology is prohibitive. Without a person to person interaction, what level of confidence will these children be able to have in the integrity of their resource material? They'll be unable to uncover the specific focus and the nature of the child's, or the adolescent's inquiry.
4062079	The reason school administrators are reviewing library budgets in light of new technology is because they themselves are mostly confused about new technology-and all too few of them have ever had much insight into what librarians do in schools. Too many school administrators, and subject teachers too, think of the library as the baby sitting department. Meanwhile, the librarians-who are usually the only professionals in the school with notable training in research methods-go along quietly, educating students about how to tell a source from a delusion. The web has made that need more acute, not less. Good quality school administrators know that, but they are few and far between.	Librarians are usually the only professionals able to teach students to recognize credible sources of information.
4061448	Easy access to relevant and accurate information is a cornerstone in our democracy. How can we not have specialists (aka librarians) who find, catalog, index, and protect the information used by all of us? We all frequently rely on specialists - medical, technical, financial, etc. - for the best information and advice. In this exploding universe of digital information, let's encourage our academic and governmental decision makers to fully realize the critical and specialized value that librarians provide to patrons of all ages.	Democracies need easy access to information. Librarians find, catalog, index, and protect information used by everyone. Specialists are relied on for advice. We must encourage our decision makers to realize the value that librarians provide even in the digital age.
4063639	My high school librarian was wonderful. She was at my 50th high school reunion two years ago, no longer able to see, alas, but still the lively, alert, aware person she was years ago. It seems to me that this isn't a question of ebooks replacing paper books as one commenter seems to imply. Nor is it a question of whether or not "internet access" is the same thing, as another comment states. Reading an ebook is a skill, and a different skill from reading a paper book. Using the internet efficiently and critically is also a learned skill. Google and Wikipedia are not the beginning and end. These skills need teaching--skilled teaching. Librarians have the skills to do this, and they have the heart and mission to do this, and they have the love of patrons of the library to do this. So let's not suggest that a visit "once a month or so" is the equivalent of a human being available down the hall daily.	Librarians are not expendable because there is more to learning than digital format. Librarians have the ability to teach a special skill set to those who come to their buildings and they generally have the love of their job to do just that.
4063299	I was a library aide in elementary school, for Mrs Archer, who treated both books and people with respect. I still have the dictionary she gave me at the end of sixth grade, when I moved up to junior high school, and another library. Mrs Archer and Mrs DeVoll, who ran the public library branch in my neighborhood, were both a huge part of my life as a child -- I am incredibly grateful to them and to all their colleagues, and am thrilled to have this chance to recognize them here, among their peers.	Public librarians can be important to people's lives.
4065692	If lawmakers don't (can't) recognize the contributions librarians make to the endless need for researching good answeres to questions that arise in all arenas of life, no wonder our politicians are so lame-brained loser-lunkheads. I want lawmakers to have close ties to competent research librarians. I want lawmakers to research, seriously research, the matters they vote on. Without librarians providing RELIABLE data, a lawmaker is voting based on guess, bias and campaign donations.	Librarians make contributions by way of researching in all arenas. Librarians provide quality data but politicians are using inappropriate influences to make the decision to remove them.
4061947	Librarians might find some protection if they were to get back in the classroom and teach a course for credit on research methods. Most school librarians are already certified teachers, so this would not be a difficult transition. Librarians are involved in classroom instruction, but usually in the classroom of another teacher. Let's get research skills or information literacy into the mandated curriculum and protect our kids' libraries and librarians.	Many school librarians are already certified teachers. Librarians are important because they are secondary instructors for other classes and they add research skills and information literacy to the curriculum.
4060841	As a school librarian who enjoys working with our local public library system, I think there is a lot to be said for looking at ways for the two to work together more closely to best serve our students, not as a cost-saving measure. Can we deliver better service and aid student achievement by joining up more effectively? But while there is overlap in the goals of public and school libraries, they have a different focus in their staffing and services. In addition, as teachers are asked to do more and more, a school librarian is able to support THEIR training needs and those of students to provide instruction and resources that match their curricular needs. The school librarian provides a fantastic value, reaching every single child and staff member in a school - every program, teacher, administrator, and students of every background and ability are served. Talk about bang for your buck!	Too much is asked of teachers. School librarians provide support and resources to help students. The school librarian's role touches all teachers and students and affects every program in a positive way.
4070387	It seems that many of the comments in this thread are from educators who are in the classroom, face to face with students every day, as am I. My experience teaching students to use the Internet and do efficient, objective research runs the gamut from those who easily learn techniques for evaluating and validating information to those who can be convinced that President Lincoln was actually a female based on a ridiculous edited photo and a headline on a tabloid from the grocery store! My advice to politicians, policy makers, and pundits is to spend a few days in a school, in Mr. Wurman's case with certified Library Media Specialist, and see what is really going on. The problem with schools today is not the teachers, it is the decision makers who think they know what is good for students because they once went to school.	The internet is full of things which can fool impressionable students, some learn easily, while other will be fooled. The politicians and policy makers should spend time with librarians before removing the position.
4062498	I have to agree with Wurman to the extent that "If we are to have any hope of meaningfully increasing the literacy of our students, the solution must lie with classroom teachers and not with libraries and librarians." What he neglects to include, however, is how important the school librarian can be in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources and skills to work with students in improving literacy. Keeping abreast of literature and new technologies that will meet the needs of the wide range of learning styles and abilities within one school is a yeoman's job. To expect the classroom teacher to be that expert without support is once again expecting too much from teachers, leading to many leaving the profession. A school librarian, if the right one is hired, can be the school leader in information resource management and use.	Librarians ensure teachers have the necessary resources. School librarians are a gate keeper to knowledge and are necessary to keep students informed of all of the ways to search for information needed to complete their studies. It puts too much pressure on teachers to have to fill yet another role. A librarian can lead the school in information resource management and use.
4060847	When every document ever written has been digitized and available without charge on the internet, then one may argue that libraries with physical books are not needed. Old, even ancient, literature is just as important for research as recent literature. During my PhD research in chemistry in the 1950s I had to refer to work from the 1850s. My university did not have these in their library because they were so old. The research institute where I ended up working most of my career would not have had this work because the originators thought that only work produced after 1925 was relevant. (Someone convinced them otherwise.) There you have the gamut of poor thinking about libraries.	Even when all knowledge and documents are electronic, librarians will still be needed. School librarians research insitute.
4060466	I am sorry but I agree. I love books and libraries. However, my kid being in elementary school, and having Library as special subject (along with music, gym, art, computers), I often think he better had a foreign language or something else instead of Library. The teachers already teach regularly the students about books and authors, and help them in this domain, in addition to very accessible local libraries and children librarians.	School teachers perform the duties that libraries are expected too perform, and thus libraries are redundant.
4059957	The entire issue then seems to one of inadequate funding and sometimes inability to even do the job. A short while ago we made great strides in reducing average class sizes at least for K-3. Now all those gains have evaporated in the crucible of 'can't afford any new taxes.' We are raising a huge number of kids who don't/can't read and certainly cannot write.	The issue with school libraries seems to be inadequate funding and inability to do the job. A large number of children cannot read or write.
17502873	One of the most crucial reasons that education from K-12 in this country is so bad are activists and aspiring politicians who run for School Boards and prevent people who have the interest and learning to keep the schools funded and educating students well from serving on the Boards. These people are out to attract attention to their pet projects, gripes, transformative visions, and general ego promoting activities which will help them advance and to excel. They basically keep the students in their districts from gaining the educations which they need to excel. Being an activist is a big ego boost but it making a difference means giving up one's ego and just making the dull and banal the focus of one's efforts.	Activists have been infiltrating school boards and preventing those who can actually run a school from being able to serve on the boards. When activists try to be politicians it is clear they are only pursuing their own narrow objectives and visions, just to stroke their own ego. They keep students from gaining the education in which they need to excel. Being a successful activist means putting one's career second.
17502811	Activists run for elected office and are elected frequently, and they advocate for their causes just like every politician advocates for something. They usually accomplish their purposes and sometimes what they introduce actually remains after they leave office. As public servants they tend to be focused upon their core constituents and their core issues and tend to trivialize the concerns which do not relate to them. They really feel that the day to day concerns of people who they formally represent but really do not wish to bother worrying about do not matter or can be ignored as they follow their passions. One of the reasons that so many people feel alienated by politicians is the way local politicians are preoccupied with causes and special interests.	Activists push for their causes when elected as all politicians do. Activists do what they set out to do and some effects are lasting. They are more focused on core issues.
2564893	RC is right. What if a public employee even publishes a comment supporting the right to burn the Koran on the New York Times website? Does that mean the government should fire him or her? This dangerous precedent will lead to the stifling of free expression and censorship throughout the country.	Limiting the speech of public workers stifles expression and promotes censorship.
2562479	Why is this such an important issue? Muslims should be sensible, diplomatic in their thoughts & actions; and not let this or any similar acts to be used as provocation. Let them burn a few Koran - heck, let them burn a few million copies. Burning some Korans certainly wouldn't weaken Islam. And didn't Allah said that "I have sent you 'The Book' and I will protect it"? So why are we so threatened by some misguided acts of a few ignorant people and let the detractors sully Islam's name? On another note, the transit worker should not have been fired. It was a private, non-violent act, and if it gave him peace of mind let him have it. Muslims should even urge the transit authority to reinstate him. And it should be remembered that if we gladly accept that denying of someone's right to free expression now out of expediency; then we must also be prepared to accept the same fate in future.	The worker's act caused no harm and should be allowed. If speech is allowed to be suppressed for public workers than we may suffer the same fate later.
2566839	Looking at the violence carried out in response to the mere concept of "International Burn a Koran Day" and before that with "Everybody Draw Muhammad Day" and before that with the publication of a few caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a Danish news paper: One could make the argument that the followers of the so-called "Religion of Peace" are so inherently violent as to make any speech which is deemed an insult to Islam tantamount to yelling "fire" in a crowded theater. If we allow ourselves to do this, then what we have essentially said is that constitution is incompatible with world wide Islam.	By limiting a public workers free speech and allowing Islam to use the threat of violence to silence opposition, then we show that our constitution is not compatible with Islamic views.
2564576	The Government has no business controlling its workers' free speech on religoius matters during off-hoursand to attempt to do so amounts to government endorsement of which religious practices are acceptable. This is easily demonstrable -- as follows: A person is an adherent to a new religion. This religion believes that the holy books of three large monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have been corrupted, have errors and therefore must be cleansed. The required cleansing is done by fire. Each Sabbath, adherents must burn one page of each of the holy books for these faiths. It is a bona-fide belief helf by adherents to this faith. If the government prevents them from conducting their cleansing ceremony because others are offended, then it is clearly taking sides on what does and does not constitute acceptable religous beliefs and practices.	Workers' off-hours religious speech should not be controlled or limited by government. You cannot decide what is and is not acceptable religious belief.
2561314	I agree that legislation neither can nor should alter one's intellectual disposition (or demonstrated deficiency thereof), but what is the cumulative, aggregate effect of such a hands-off approach from our government when the media is so actively involved in pursuit of the polar opposite: informing citizens' views, fertilizing nascent biases with clever sound bites, punditry and selective editing, and even stoking flames of [fill in the blank] - all the while protected by the First Amendment? The result is a two-way mirror, with the citizen - Quran burning or not - sitting in the interrogation room, too comfortable in his or her biases or just too dumb to question the reflection before them.	Limiting speech is a two way mirror with a citizen being too comfortable in his or her biases or too dumb to question what they see.
2565476	"But I certainly would fire any of my employees who would consider flag-burning as an act of defiance. It's not. It's childish and immature behavior, and those who would do such a thing would be unworthy of public employment." Actually, I once told my wife that if an amendment were actually passed banning flag-burning, I would burn one the next day on the steps of the Supreme Court. It's not necessarily an act of childish defiance; it can be an all-in statement of what is important about this country. By the way, flag-burning is required by law. Last time I looked, it was the only proper way to dispose of a flag too worn to be flown any more.	Their speech isn't childish, it is their personal belief of what is important in this country.
2565169	As I Muslim, let me say that I am glad that Salam Al-Marayati is not my boss. That the head of MPAC does not understand something as basic as the right to free speech, gives me pause about his own understanding of America and, by extension, that of his organization. Mr. Fenton had every right to burn the Qur'an and should not have been fired, and I fully support his right to do so and believe he should be given his job back.	Not allowing free speech for public workers makes me question if leaders understands what America is about. The right of free speech is granted to all Americans and it was done off the job, therefor he had the freedoms to do so.
2567516	This is America, and we should not give in to political correctness to appease these fanatical Muslim thugs. If someone can burn the flag with impunity, show a crucifix dipped in urine, stage plays making fun on Catholics, deny the Holocaust, then he or she can burn a religious text. And the Muslims who seek to live in this country had better get used to it. Will the ACLU, that intrepid defender of left-wing and Muslim civil liberties, take up this case? I doubt it.	Political correctness should not superseded our rights to free speech. A person is free to burn the flag, show a defaced crucifix, stage plays mocking religion, and deny the holocaust. So they should be free to burn a religious text as well.
2567078	At what point does the concept of free speech become a hate crime? The Nazi regime started out burning books written by Jews and then we know where that led. Taken to an extreme, burning of books is just the opposite of free speech. It empowers ignorance by destroying the written word. Sadly, this is an example of someone committing a dumb, but not illegal, act. Is it really freedom of speech or an example of intense hatred? Should that person be fired for his actions, off duty? Probably not in our society. Is this an example of American society, at its best? Definitely, NOT.	Although the speech is hateful, off duty actions cannot be considered to fire someone.
2566415	As long as he did it on his own time, did not use resources from his employer, and in no way represented himself as acting in an official capacity, he had every right to do what he did. I don't agree with what he did. But he had every right to do it. If employees are able to fire their employees for doing things off duty that the employer doesn't agree with, essentially we don't have a right to free speech anymore. We just have a right to speech that doesn't offend our employer, and that's not much of a right.	Workers should have right to speech if they do it on their own time with their own resources, representing themselves. This would eliminate free speech.
2566181	What the NJ Transit employee failed to understand is that there is a distinction between free speech rights (burning a Koran, a flag or what have you) and the fact that employment in America is, by and large, at-will -- you can get fired if your boss doesn't like the color of your socks. If his off-hours -- but very public and very controversial -- actions were deemed to affect his workplace efficiency, then his employer had a perfect right to fire him. Sadly, this particular individual has learned, in the harshest way possible, a rule of Free Speech that many tend to forget in our times: just because you have the right to say whatever you want it doesn't mean that it's always a smart idea to do so.	Free speech rights do not trump employers rights to at will employment. If a person's actions during his or her work hours affect workplace efficiency then employer's may have a right to fire. Although free speech is the law, sometimes one should refrain from speaking.
2565794	Well, that guy just burned a bunch of paper... Why he can't protest against fanatic Muslims? Those who punished him are just getting upset for nothing. Can the burning of a Bible or a Koran means war? this is stupid. People must learn to not get upset for things like that. To convince about God, please don't use terrorism or bullying... use love, reasoning, and wisdom	If the transit worker caused no harm he should be allowed to protest.
2565452	One thing that nobody seems to be asking, and that no source seems to have made available (quite possibly because nobody knows) is what Mr. Fenton was wearing. Regardless of being off-duty, if he was clearly identifying himself as a Transit employee he's very likely still subject to the Transit code of conduct. Most New York firefighters wear NYFD t-shirts when off duty, at least some of the time. the same goes for New York police and NYPD t-shirts. If Mr. Fenton was doing the same, there's a strong case that he's acting as a representative of the NJ Transit Authority rather than a private citizen. Keep in mind two things folks. First, if he'd burned a Christian Bible lynch mobs would be forming. Second, the only protection this idiot has from being fired is that he works for a government office. Any private employer could fire him for the act without hesitation.	If he is clearly identifying himself as a Transit employee then he is still subject to the Transit code of conduct. Private employers can fire workers for acts easier than public employers can.
2565365	While I find Mr. Fenton's behavior appallingly violent and highly immoral, I also find the long reach of his employer's arm legally unsupportable. I wouldn't be surprised to see this man reinstated in the backlash. Being a democracy has always meant tolerating all manner of disrespectful and hateful language - as long as it remains language and not a specific call to violent action.	The long reach of an employer's arm is legally unsupportable. Public workers should be allowed free speech as long as it does not lead to violence.
2565341	Democracy destroys itself because it abuses its right to freedom and equality. Because it teaches its citizens to consider audacity as a right, lawlessness as a freedom, abrasive speech as equality and anarchy as progress. -Isocrates I believe in the first amendment but this man is intentionally trying to cause pain to others by disrespecting their beliefs. People will obviously be upset by this. I am upset by it and I am not a Muslim. So NO your 1st amendment rights are not violated when you are told to shut up because you are going to cause a panicked mob during a fire drill. You DON"T get to claim American rights of protection when you violate the tenets of equality and freedom in your speech.	Freedom without responsibility and accountability undermines democracy. Speech can be limited when the intent is to cause pain and disrespect others beliefs. The 1st amendment does not provide the right to cause panic in a mob. Public workers have a right to free speech when off-duty.
18200299	As long as jobs are scarce, it makes sense that people who have not been convicted should have a better shot at them. This means that the burden of the scarcity of jobs should fall more heavily on the convicted, even though this makes it more difficult for them to go straight and have successful lives. On the other hand, those with criminal records and experience are more likely to return to crime if they cant find legal sources of income like jobs, and those with no criminal experience are less likely. From this point of view, it makes sense to give the oil to the squeaky hinges, thereby rewarding lawbreaking and penalizing those who have not gotten caught breaking the law. This is our present policy, which we wind up with because it is supposedly cheaper in the short run. People unlikely to make trouble because they cannot find jobs are left to their own devices.	Non-felons should get priory for jobs when they are scarce. Those that have committed crimes against society should have that seen when competing fairly for jobs with those who did not commit crimes.
18197815	No, ban the box is not enough there should be a time limit for back ground checks, 6 months for non violent misdemoners, 2 years for non violent felonies. and a longer time for violent crimes depending upon the crime. People need to work and have a job and have a place to live.	Applicants should not have to report nonviolent crimes after 6 months (misdemeanor) or 2 years (felony), and whether an applicant must report violent crimes depends on the crime. Everyone needs to work, have a job and a place to live.
18199552	The desire to continue punishing people who have served their sentence and paid their debt to society is pervasive, unjust and inhumane. It seems all too many of us would prefer to push individuals with a criminal record off the proverbial edge over extending a hand to help them regain their footing. Fear may be at the bottom of this pattern of behavior but in my view it only makes things worse in the long run.	Criminal records of job applicants should not be an initial screening tool for employers. Too many people would prefer to push individuals with a criminal record of over the proverbial edge instead of giving them a helping hand. It gives a very negative impression.
5899543	It is nothing more then one big commercial farce labeled a friendly competition. At the end London is going to find out its folly just like Greece did. When it is all over Lords Coe will be no where around to address the issue and answer questions.	The Olympics are a big commercial rather than a friendly competition.
5903270	A lifelong New Yorker, I agree entirely with Mr. Moss about the detrimental effects of hosting the Olympics that a city suffers. Now, as a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University's Institute for Public Service, I hope he will turn his attention to the devastating effects of NYU's expansion on neighborhood life and architectural scale in our city.	Cities suffer detrimental effects when hosting the Olympics. NYU's expansion has harmed the neighborhood life of the city.
5907773	So based on these numbers London is forking out ~12-24 Billion dollars to pay for the Olympics. According to the Official projection they have already spent 12 Billion pounds (or just abous $20 billion). Unofficially the bill is looking more like 24 Billion pounds (or closer to 40 Billion dollars). What a complete waste of Money.	The Olympics have already cost 12 billion pounds and will end up costing closer to 23 billion. Hosting the Olympics is a waste of money.
5905284	The Olympics seem like a frivolous project that will benefit a few well placed construction companies. After building the venues they get to walk away with fat bank accounts and the cities get stuck with maintenance and interest expenses. Granted the cities now have an opportunity to use the venues for other events, but those opportunities are few and far between. The publicity generated for the host city seems dubious. Who doesn't alread know about London or Rio?	These games really only serve as a frivolous event that benefits construction companies with connections. Building the venues leads to cities being stuck with maintenance and interest expenses. Even though they are opportunities for the cities. Publicity generated for Olympics included has both positive and negative impacts.
5360372	If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping. I am saddened that people are making money off these stupid ideas that you seem to be willing to propagate. Kids go to public schools and they do learn there. If parents want them to learn a competing view, have them pick up a book after school and learn some more. To ask public schools to cater to the whims of parents is more harmful than the big, bad federal government mandates you seem to fear sir.	Public schools already tailor classes to children's needs without parent interference. How much students learn is also dependent on how much they care about learning. Kids do learn at public schools. Parents can choose what their kids learn at home. Federal government mandates are less harmful than parent mandates.
5358829	"Then numerous schools will spring up and parents will be able to pair with educators who share their views..." I should think college admissions offiicials would be interested to know if an applicant is coming from a school whose goal is to omit significant areas of history, science, etc. What a shame for those young people who will be deemed ill-equipped to enter the world of grand ideas. Here's how it works in my house: My kids learn facts at school, we talk about the implications at home, I give them my view and tell them to form their own. To date, none of them have spontaneously combusted.	Parents should not be able to select their child's learning plan because it could negatively effect their college performance. Kids should learn at school and be taught at home as well.
5358519	"One size does not fit all" is a good sound byte. And trying to make students learn about and take an interest in subjects in which they have little or no interest is difficult. But allowing students to choose to be ignorant by only studying what they want to study is just sheer stupidity. We Americans are already THE most illiterate and ignorant bunch of "educated" human beings on the planet. But countries like Russia and China are certainly pleased with "It's your right ot can be as stupid and ignorant as you want to" mentality.	Its good to remember "One size does not fit all". Students do not need to be allowed to choose to be ignorant. Americans are already illererate.
5357182	So if someone can't do algebra they can out of it, but if another student takes it and fails they get an F on their transcripts? How could this work and be fair to those who attempt to take subjects which challenge themselves?	Parental control will lead to children being unchallenged at school.
5355496	People assume the only parents opting out will be conservative evangelicals who don't want their kids to learn about evolution or the birds & bees. When I was in school, one of the best history teachers in the district was forced to retire early because a few African American parents didn't like how he taught the Civil War. Now around here in CA, Latino families are objecting to how American history books teach the Mexican-American War. People have a lot of different opinions. Liberals want their way of thinking taught, conservatives want theirs. There has to be some way for schools to deal with this other than bowing down to the pressure of the most vocal parents.	Political bias clouds the debate surrounding public education. Need to find another way than bowing down to the pressure of the most vocal parents.
5350361	It's disappointing that the Times would ask a professional bigot to contribute to this discussion. The Cato Institute is funded by people who wish to denigrate and weaken government at every level. If they pay McCluskey's salary, it is because he is carrying their water. Parents who are not content with what their children may or may not be taught in public classrooms have always been free to home school or enroll them in private schools. Public education has been a smashing success story for America and tens of millions of its citizens. However, allowing individual parents to alter lesson plans at will can only result in chaos and a less-educated population. This New Hampshire experiment will end in failure.	Parents are welcome to home school or find a school that teaches as they approve instead of dictating public school teaching. Public schools have successfully taught tens of millions of Americans. Results of individual parents controlling lesson plans would be chaos and less-educated population.
5373407	I think that parents should not have the right to change every lesson they dont like. If they dont like the then they should ask for the student to learn something else not change the lesson. If parents are so worried what there children are learning then they should put them in pirvate school. Also teachers have gone to school for this , this is what they do for a living so i think they know what to teach kids.	Parents can choose to place their children in a different school, if they don't like what is being taught. Teachers are trained professionals and I believe the parental interference only hinders them.
5365834	Should parents be given a shopping list or a line item veto for everything their tax dollars are involved in? Seriously? Procedures & materials for road repair? Medical practices in surgery? Proper chemicals used to treat the town water? We could all have opinions on these but are they professional or informed? Parents do not have a six-year degree and teaching license to qualify for text/curriculum/lesson plan design - just as they have no geology degree for road projects, or med degree for surgical procedures, or chemical engineering degree for civic operations. If individuals are so fearful and filled with anxiety & distrust of modern society, isnt that a private matter for the family and perhaps a mental health professional to deal with vs. these private fears being foisted on the general public who want modern medecine, scholarly education, and sound civic operations to be able to do their best for us. This attitude of "Some of my tax money is involved so I wish to inject my own set of facts and opinions with a red face and a loud voice like I've seen on Fox News" is getting out of hand.	Parents don't have a six-year degree, or teaching license to qualify for text/curriculum/lesson plan design -  just as they have no geology degree for road projects, or med degree for surgical procedures, or chemical engineering degree for civic operations. People trying to force their opinions on the school by claiming it is their right because they pay taxes is getting out of control.
5359179	I live in New Hampshire most of the time and all I can say is that this doesn't surprise me. The right wing has taken over the state and as far as they're concerned education is a waste of time because gravity doesn't exist and global warming only has something to do with sexual dysfunction.	The right wing has corrupted education and is convinced it is a waste.
5358904	My comprehensive high school sex education course was one of the most valuable to me of all my subjects. My high school classmates and I were the guinea pigs for the pilot program at LSU's University Lab School in 1953. The course was quite comprehensive. It covered the mechanics, contraception, VD, prostitution, deviant sexual behavior. I don't recall the word abstinence being used. However, the teacher, J.Q. Long, emphasized that sex should be more than a physical act with potentially serious consequences, physical and psychological, and was not to be undertaken casually. Twenty-five years later I was amazed when some parents in my children's school in Michigan objected to the sex education courses which I'm pretty sure were less comprehensive than mine thirty years before in Louisiana.	Parents should not have control over important topics like sex ed.
5358339	Obviously they SHOULD NOT. Such people are often narrow minded and ignorant, and want to keep their children the same way. How a state would write such a law says something about the sickness of their legislature. How about parents who DON'T LIKE ANYTHING? Will the school have to write an entire curriculum for them and assign a teacher to work with this child and teach whatever worthless nonsense the parent's desire?	The parents that want to control learning are narrow minded and ignorant and wish their children to be the same. The school shouldn't have to rewrite the curriculum and get new teachers because the parent doesn't like what the school teaches.
5357545	I'd just like to see the curriculum. Too many times, the syllabus for any given course is behavior focused with no mention of the topic material to be covered. I also have to agree with one of the commentators below. Language Arts and similar classes are not academically challenging for good readers because of the need to accommodate those who struggle. I don't object to helping those who struggle but I would certainly let my child opt out of classes where he/she does not learn anything new. I'd also opt out of the character education training, which too often, requires students to respect everyone's opinion.	I would like to see what they are teaching my kids. Smart kids aren't being challenged in language arts and other classes because the teacher has to work with the kids who struggle. I would also prefer to avoid character education training, which requires students to respect everyone's opinion.
5356141	One of the horrible developments of the internet age is that people can actively avoid those topics they do not agree with or which cause them distress. One of the fundamental issues facing our society is that this avoidance of intellectual conflict leads to STUPID people, and an unwillingness to compromise for the betterment of society. Civil relations and critical thinking are dead under this model. Pick and Choose should be OPPOSED at ALL LEVELS. The only thing I have to say about getting old is that it is likely I will be dead and buried before this country implodes in a holocaust of partisan hate. But it will come.	Avoiding intellectual conflict creates stupid people who will not compromise for society. If parents controlled why kids learned civil relations and learning critical thought are dead.
5354126	I think that teachers should teach what there assinged to teach. Teachers have gone to school for this and this is what they do for a living. So they probably know what they're talking about. If you dont like what teachers are teaching in public schools then you should probably enroll your kid in a private school	Teachers should teach what there assigned. Teachers have gone to school for this, it's what they do for a living. Parents should consider private schools if they don't like public curriculum.
12104587	I am not now, nor Have I ever been a beach person. I have often commented that beach front property would be wasted on me, and those who most want it and are willing to pay for it should have it. I do, however, believe that private ownership should be limited to the spaces above and adjoining the beaches. Public access to the beach seems to be a no-brainer. I believe we should also make these private owners of beach adjacent property responsible for rebuilding their own homes when the next storm or tsunami comes their way. Beach cottages used to be ramshackle affairs, built on sticks, with second hand wicker furniture. Now the hoipolloi builds mega million dollar mansions, filled with great furniture and art on the beach. Surprise surprise, your house got washed a way again. The Federal Government should stop encouraging and supplementing people who build irresponsible sand castles on foundations of sand.	Private owners should also be responsible for rebuilding their own homes when storms hit. The Federal Government should stop encouraging people who build irresponsible beachfront homes.
12103871	Most beach communities have public beaches and private land. I don't see why that's a problem, frankly; it is a problem if people begin believing that 'what's yours is mine,' unless you want people to then begin believing that your home is also theirs because they like it, or your living room couch should be theirs because it's 'welcoming.' Unless you're a communist; then it makes sense.	Most areas have both public and private beaches. What belongs to one person doesn't belong to the masses and the masses should have no claim to personal property.
12100570	I would argue that, at least on the Gulf Coast, the government DOES compensate coastal residents for the use of their land. They are compensated in the form of aid whenever a hurricane destroys their beach houses. Seems to me a small price to pay to allow people to walk on the beach behind your house. (I would, however, understand if beachfront owners pushed for strict rules concerning the use of those beaches: curfews, open container rules, and that sort of thing). . Me, I'll avoid the whole problem when I buy a weekend house for my family. We'll buy on a lake instead of on the ocean. No beach to worry about, and no hurricanes....	In some areas, the government reimburses private residences for the public use of their land. If a hurricane destroys their beach house, they are compensated with aid, so allowing people to walk on the beach is a fair trade off.
12099899	If some rich curmudgeon buys all the land around a public school can he then deny access to the kids? Access should be guaranteed: if the landowner won't sell a piece of his property leading to the public area, it should be confiscated; case closed.	Lakes are public and should be accessible. Access should be guaranteed, and a landowner should have to either sell the property or have it confiscated.
12103852	What exactly is the point of preserving the pristine character of beautiful beaches if the only people who can afford to enjoy them are the uberwealthy people who own them? The value of such scarce natural resources is so high that it really shouldn't be affordable for any one person to own them. Because, once a beach leaves the public domain and becomes the private property of one person, the benefits of that beach are the right of that person to enjoy (and charge others for or restrict others from) in perpetuity. In my opinion, beaches all over the country should be declared public property	Preserving beautiful beaches is pointless if only uberwealthy people enjoy them?. This natural resource that is not readily available everywhere should not be the under the sole ownership of one person, instead it should be a public domain. Beaches are private property and the owner can decide how to use them. Beaches should be public land.
12103423	Beeches and access to them should be open to all. For those that argue the rights of private property and the free-market solutions they should remember it when it comes to flood insurance and disaster relief. The public should not have to open their purse for others sho build homes on what should be public commons.	Beaches and their access should be public. Proponents of private property rights and the free-market should consider social programs like disaster relief and flood insurance. Homes built on public commons and not open to the public, should not receive public funding.
12104634	I grew up in Malibu and my family still lives there. I have no problem with public access to beaches, what I do have a problem with is public access with no public facilities - ie. restrooms and trashcans. I can't count the number of times my family picked up litter on the beach in front of our home or emptied the overflowing, un-maintained public trash cans at the access. The public has a right to the beach, but I'd like to think I have a right not to step off my front steps into another persons excrement. Disgusting.	I have no problem with it. Beachfront should be open to the public, so long as the public takes care of the land.
12103088	Maine and several other eastern states define private ownership out the mean low tide level. Water covered zones are open to fishing, fowling, and water-borne navigation, but not recreation. I certainly support the idea of public access, especially in areas where barrier reefs and islands naturally move around. I don't think your typical Maine coast solid-rock ledge is in that category.	People can fish, fowl and drive on the water, but can't use if for recreation. Beachfront should be made public, especially where barrier reefs and islands are.
12098143	I would say if private owners insist that the public not be allowed access to public beaches, IE: high tide marks. All recovery of private property because of natural disaster be nullified. My tax dollars pay for these folks to recover loses due to their choice to build in obviously unstable environments. Therefore if the public may not cross their property to access the public lands; the Federal government should not be obligated to insure and/or pay for their loses. Enough government subsidies of private luxury, private beaches.	The public's tax dollars pay for recovered losses from building in unstable environments. The US government shouldn't' have to pay to insure or cover losses if their beaches remain private.
6627987	A well groomed man is not un-manly. A real man does not need to look like big foot and act like a neanderthal to be manly. Manliness is stepping up to ones responsibilities without question, being courteous, gracious and fair. A real man is not afraid to be gentle, kind and helpful. A real man is confident enough in his manliness to not care if anyone thinks he is manly enough!	Manliness is not contingent upon grooming. Real men don't need big muscles to be manly. Modern manliness is defined by the ability to take care of one's responsibilities, and not to be afraid of showing emotions or not being perceived to be manly enough. Men who are confident enough are manly.
6619277	Not being from New York, maybe this discussion isn't meant for me, but I have to weigh in. I grew up in the country, on a farm, with a man for a father. He taught me to be like him: wake up early, work hard, eat a good meal, go to bed, repeat. He taught me that it is the responsibility of the strong to stand up for the weak, to do the right thing because it's right and not because someone is watching, to treat everyone with respect even if you loath them. He taught me how to shoot a gun, how to hunt, and the responsibilities that each of those carry with them. He raised me to be better than him, because that is the mark of a good man: leaving things better than you found them. So, to me, if a man does all of these things, he's a manly man even when he's getting a manny peddy. (don't know if I spelled that right because I've never had one.)	Everyone should treat each other with respect and stand up for the weak. Being a man means leaving the world better than you found it, my father raised me that way, so you are still a man even if you get your nails done.
6616203	Yes. That is what I think most women want. Personally, I can easily adapt to a man's appearance, be he a well-coiffed girly man or a gorilla guy. Who cares? It's not how he looks but how he treats me that really matters. To me, real manliness is a guy who takes responsibility, who supports and protects his wife and children, who stands up for others, who does the right thing in the face of difficulties, who doesn't whine and complain about his life but instead carries on with dignity and compassion for others....someone who walks his talk. In other words ... he has a code.	What matters is how a man treats others, not how he appears. To me a real man is a man who walks his talk, and who faces challenges without whining.
6622253	The notion of manhood traits aroses from primal times when manhood connoted the ability to ensure the survival of oneself and then of family and community. So manhood became associated with the warrior, the hunters, the frontiersman, the guard and the provider. Woman complemented primarily by being the homemaker, while her man was out in the wild or at war. But ancient threats and dangers are gone, society is relatively safe and women are quite capable of providing for themselves, thank you. But modern threats have taken new forms but the underlying gnawing inner emotions of fear, insecurity, doubt, hopelessness etc still exist. So the new role of a man is to inspire faith where there is fear, courage where there is doubt, hope in despair and love in the midst of hate. all this talk of rough edged muscles, sweatiness instead of perfume, ability to light fires and chop wood are nothing more than sexual fantasies and turn ons - which of course is still necessary for good relationships and survival of the species.	There aren't as many dangers as there were in ancient times so woman can take care of themselves. Gnawing inner emotions of fear, insecurity, doubt, and hopelessness still exist. A man should be inspirational and courageous and loving in a world full of hate.
6611644	The manly men I know don't eat bacon cheeseburgers or drive SUV's. But they have plenty of strength, ambition, and, yes, even love and compassion. I'm not ready to give up on the male species yet. But I could do without all the smartphone addictions.	In my opinion eating meat and driving big cars do not make a man today,but a different kind of strength and compassion is what makes modern men manly.
6621965	This article is silly, online dating sites are full of 'manly men'- carpenters, construction workers, laborers, and others. These men are not exactly faring well in this economy, and at no other time does there seem to be more a disconnect between women and these guys than now, it seems.	Online dating sites have many "manly men".
6620440	this is so sexist! Smelling clean, keeping fit, and looking put together does not make a man feminine any more than having back hair, showering once a week, or beating his wife would make him more masculine. I am NOT equating domestic abuse with having back hair by any means. But I am trying to show that gender stereotypes are stupid. There is nothing masculine or feminine about grooming your body hair or wanting to look good. If a unibrow is bothering a man and all it takes to fix it is a $20/20 minute trip to the salon, then whats the problem? I also don't appreciate how a lot of these things that are popular with gay men get labeled as feminine when applied to straight men. Perhaps in the past gay men have had more liberty to deviate from gender stereotypes and as a result straight men have felt more at ease to do the same. I really don't think that there is any justification for the kind of reactionary view that some of the opinions expressed here.	Certain activities don't make men more or less manly. Grooming and attention to appearance is not gender specific. Straight men now feel more at ease to deviate from gender stereotypes because gay men have historically had the liberty to do so.
6618700	The red meat and potato men are probably like my overweight, high blood pressure father, dead of a heart attack at 56. Call me crazy, but as I enter my mid 40s, I prefer to eat more vegetables, lean meat and fish, and go to the gym (or otherwise exercise), I have the feeling a lot of my peers, who also lost their fathers at what today seems like a young age, are doing the same so they can still be around when their sons reach their mid 40s instead of just being a person from history to their grandchildren talked about now and then.	Modern men are masculine enough because the typical masculine profile of a red meat and potato men is like my father who died of a heart attack at 56.
6620153	I'm married to a man who is vegan, can build and fix stuff, grew up in a farming culture, is a NYC transplant, a total intellectual, and cares about his appearance. Since when do we need to categorize men? Isn't this what women hate being done to them? That said, this was a fun and entertaining set of opinions. I wonder what people would think in a couple decades if they came across this collection!	I car about my looks, and I am a married man who is also vegan, and grew up farming and building and fixing stuff. Categorizing men is sexist.
6620360	This is my fifth read pertaining to this article and I will give credit to Schlossman for having the most mature and evolved view. Lets not forget the man of yesterday was less likely to help out in the house with regards to children and chores (a 70 to 90 hour a week job if left solely to women). To wish for the man of yesterday is myopic - times have changed and the having the costume of a man does not equal being more responsible and courageous. Schlossman states to just be "...honest, kind, tolerant, open, intrepid, self-aware, inquisitive, etc..." - that works for me and for societies sake, should work for everyone else too.	Modern men help around the house with chores and children. Regardless of the costume, men are still responsible and courageous.
6006832	It has nothing to do with nutrition education. Nowadays, we have this magical thing called the internet. There are no excuses for not knowing what's healthy and what isn't. You're either too lazy to figure it out for yourself (and so you let the food companies tell you what to eat -- nice conflict of interest right there), or you simply don't care. I also like how you mention ridiculous "documented" results yet fail to provide said documents. A "50% reduction in the incidence of children becoming overweight." You can deduce that just by changing drinks in a vending machine? Please tell what analysis was performed to come to that fitting conclusion -- as a statistician, I'd love to know. And, Yael, "100% juice" isn't any better than soda. It's all garbage.	Lack of education about nutrition isn't the problem. The internet contains sufficient nutrition information. Information regarding healthy eating is readily accessible to any who care to educate themselves.
6003260	It's really not enough to say "we need more information". Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong. For well over 50 years, we've known why we get fat and oddly enough, it's not the fat in our diets as most public health officials would have us believe. It's not portion sizes nor is it caused by lack of exercise. It's simple carbohydrates...toxic sugar, high fructose corn syrup and white breads, pastas and sugary sodas and juices. Gary Taubes, in his book "Why We Get Fat - What To Do About It" details the reasons for our modern day obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sadly, our fixation on "heart healthy, low fat and portion controlled" diets will only postpone the day that we discover the real secret to normal weight and sensible exercise...a low carb diet, free of processed foods full of toxic ingredients subsidized by the U.S. Congress and recommended by nutrition "experts" who will never tell the truth about why we get fat in the first place.	Doctors and the government have bad information. We've known for a long time that carbohydrates are what make us fat, not fats in our foods like the public health officials say. Congress and nutriton "experts" subsidize toxic ingredients used to make processed foods that keep us unhealthy.
6032130	The real reason people get take out food... they don't know how to cook. Mom didn't take the time to educate the kids, girls and boys alike, on how to cook and the schools have done away with Home Economics classes for science and math classes thinking this will better America. Over the last 40 years the ease of outside food access into the home outweighs the time of cooking in the home and getting everyone fed and into bed for the night. The ability for people to slow down and have family time, and moreover people want and know how to use family time, will be the obesiety epidemic end and will solve so many more problems than just America being fat.	People get take out food since they cannot cook. Some kids are not taught by parents how to cook, and many schools have done away with home economics in favor of science and math. The ability to get food outside the home with ease over the last 40 year, requires us to need more advice about eating well.
6007802	Jane Black's findings, that people still do eat poorly even when they have easy access to better foods and the means to afford them, is telling. We always want the easy way out. It's human nature. It's far easier for busy parents to get the family take out pizza and fast food--foods kids love--than it is to cook. And once someone's developed a taste for high fat, high sugar meals, there's going to be a lot of resistance to eating more healthfully.	According to Jane Black, people eat poorly even when they have other options. We want the easy solution. It's easier for familes to order kid-friendly take out than to cook. A developed taste prevents people from eating well.
6007042	The single most important issue is 'portion size'. People don't need to change how they cook as much as they need to change how much they cook. My son gained weight when he left home, but when he lost 50 lbs with the help of a diet sold by a national franchiser, he realised that the amount of food that he was served at home (and complained about) was a normal portion size. Now he is much more thoughtful about what food he orders, even from the fast food chains. Try searching on the term "portion distortion' and look at the 2 powerpoint presentations from the NIH. They are very useful in teaching patients about what to eat and how active you must be if you eat the large portions that are sold.	Americans might be healthier if we understood nutrition better. We do need more advice about eating well because many people lack the knowledge of healthy cooking. My son gained weight and lost weight when he ate prepackaged meals and realized in spite of his complaining I had been serving a normal portion of food. If you look up the information, you can read about eating well and staying active.
6003819	It's actualy a global issue, in the UK, we're increasingly heading down this obesity path, despite similar popular trends for buying fresh/loca/organic, etc. I don't think there's an easy solution, I think it involves policy effort across a number of areas (unfortunately), including education, food regulation (labelling, salt content, etc), and possibly that dreaded word:..tax Taxing those food products that, like cigarettes and alcohol, are vices and placing a collective burden on our national healthcare systems. I speak as a smoker, drinker and occasional lover of fast food, just aware that clearly the current situation is taking society as a whole down a very unhealthy path. Also, very dangerous territory, both morally and practically, but perhaps directly factoring in BMI (or something) into the cost of health insurance?	People globally are headed toward obesity, even with fresh, local, and organic trends.
6003165	Self-control & delayed satisfaction are habits worth learning at a young age. These habits may help one to resist impulse & convenience buying of fast food & snacks. The food-industrial complex will always be with us but we can learn healthy habits to defend against their marketing.	It is good to learn self-control and delayed satisfaction while young. We can learn healthy habits to defend against the marketing of the food industrial complex.
6002988	Many people are uninformed about diet and lifestyle to promote optimum health. Less is being taught students of today than was taught when I was in school (in the 40's and 50's). The agriculture/food industry and the medical community have been promoting the values of greed rather than health. Our car culture has taken the most healthful exercise from many of us -- walking.	Many people don't know how to eat healthily. Less advice on eating well is being taught in school the in the 40's or 50's. The food and medical industries have been promoting values of greed over health.
6002312	One way Americans can change their diets is to do it ONE small step at a time. For example, I decided to drink green tea in the morning, instead of a coffee latte. Later, I decided to substitute iced water for soft drinks. Another change was whole wheat thin buns for sandwiches, instead of regular bread. Instead of yogurt with lots of calories and sugar, I now eat plain, non-fat Greek yogurt mixed with fresh fruits like blueberries or bananas. Each change was painless and over the years the weight melted away, until I reached a BMI number of 22. I think I would have been discouraged if I had tried to make all the changes in my diet at once. It would have seemed too hard.	Americans can change their diets one small step at a time.
15986315	59% of California's non elderly Medicaid recipients are Hispanic. Large portions of California, from the Mexican border, through LA, and up the spine of the state to Sacramento, have been overrun with illegal immigrants. As a group, they are poorly educated, low earning, and their families are on the full array of entitlements from birth. Some model.	A majority of California's Medicaid recipients are immigrants. Illegal immigrants have overrun large portions of California. Immigrants are poorly educated, low earning, and entitled.
15977205	One third of births in California are to illegal immigrants, the medical bills paid by the taxpayers, at a cost of billions of dollars a year, after which the family qualifies for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, and subsidized housing for the next 18 years. Not exactly a formula for attracting the best and brightest.	One-third of the births in CA are to illegal immigrants, which costs the taxpayers billions of dollars in medical expenses and entitlement programs every year.
15976967	The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.	Undocumented workers burden society. Unauthorized immigration results in worse living conditions for everyone. Children are left in a legal limbo because of unauthorized entry. Exploited workers can do little about it unless they force the employers on their own.
15975442	Really? Maybe 10 years ago that was the prevailing sentiment. But since the illegal immigrants' protests and activism, and the trivialization and demonization of people who criticize the illegal nature of their status and actions, and being called racist or worse, I and many people I know are less supportive of these policies. For criminals to demand rights, and to totally ignore their illegal status starts to show that there is now a sense of entitlement, when there is no basis for one. The situation is better solved by deportation.	Immigrants have broken a law, making them criminals, but they now demand US Constitutional rights and feel entitled to them when they have no legal claim to them. Deportation should be used to solve the problem.
16000844	We have a woman sitting in federal prison because she refused to abide by the disputed 5-4 ruling of the supreme court. Meanwhile we have entire sanctuary cities in brazen and unrepentant violation of federal immigration laws who suffer zero consequences. Instead they are cheered on by leftist for repudiating and nullifying the federal immigration laws in their communities.	We have entire sanctuary cities in brazen and unrepentant violation of federal immigration laws, who suffer zero consequences.
15978831	This article is misleading readers into thinking all the immigrants are the problem. In fact, only illegal immigrants are , not legal. We filed the paperwork, paid for the fees , waited years for visa to be available, countless of trips to UCSIS , and U.S Consular. Years after years of waiting, we can now set foot on U.S head held high as legal immigrants. Meanwhile, illegal immigrants sneak into the U.S , anchor babies, expect to have benefits and free education without paying a penny. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. Is is fair of legal immigrants like us ? Dear Mr Saavedra, have you ever been cut in line while you are lining up in a busy restaurant or theme park? That's the same feeling of legal immigrants toward illegal immigrants and freeloaders like you.	Illegal immigrants are a problem. Illegal immigrants take advantage of the freebies America has to offer without paying into the system.
15978072	One more time, with feeling!!!! Immigration is not, nor has never been a problem for us. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION is the problem! If we are a sovereign Nation we need protected borders! What don't some bleeding heart Liberals understand about this!!	Legal immigration is not a problem. A sovereign nation needs protected borders.
15978895	The undocumented migrant who stays and becomes a member of the community, adhering to the laws and contributing to the community is, in essence, a de facto citizen. He or she has earned the rights of citizenship in ways that the lucky few who obtain green cards in the lottery or have employers who can finagle HIB visas.have not earned citizenship. Congress should stop the pandering to the fearful and hateful, and figure out a way to define and recognize de facto citizenship.	A migrant is behaving like a citizen when they follow the low and contribute to the community. Congress should define de facto citizenship instead of yielding to people who hate and fear.
15975693	They are certainly no problem to Democrats where they are viewed as new voters who will be sustained by welfare paid for by someone else. Once the Dems have this huge voting bloc there will be no viable conservative resistance. Of course they don't want the conservatives to go away completely otherwise who would they blame all their problems and failures on? Question: If illegals are such an asset why not open the border completely?	Democrats don't see immigrants as a problem because immigrants vote democrat.
15975417	I think the issue that we ought to be able to agree on, is that birth right citizenship has to end. The motivation for immigration can vary, but poverty and lack of opportunity in the country of origin seems like its often a cause. And international policies that worsen prospects for a better life would have to be seen as a contributing factor as well. Yet, openly rewarding illegal immigrants with automatic birthright citizenship is incentivizing the disregard of the host country's own laws. This continuing conversation over immigration going on in the US, mirrors that going on in Europe today. It's the same issue. Do we fix the world first, and hope the desperation driving illegal immigration abates over time? Or absorb those flows of people from those troubled regions seeking a better life now? I think its better, and more fair to all concerned, to have a managed process for documented labor, visitation and immigration, than a mad lawless rush across borders. Civilization and civilized behavior breaks down in the face of desperation. Accepting unlimited immigrants from around the world would not improve the lives of those left behind. Who is responsible for helping them?	Automatic birthright citizenship is an incentive for illegal immigrants. Desperation causes civilized people to act poorly. Accepting unlimited immigrants will not improve the lives of those left behind. Who will help them?.
15975337	Cheating is the problem: H-1B visas granted solely to lower an employer's labor cost. Foreigners illegally entering our country or illegally overstaying in our country. Dishonest news media discourse is also a significant problem: All Americans support controlled immigration with quotas set by our Congress. No Americans support uncontrolled entry into our country or the granting of citizenship to foreigners illegally present in our country (illegal aliens).	Immigrants are being granted visa's solely to lower employer's labor costs.
15987683	Exploitation of "unauthorized immigrants?" Seriously? They are here illegally and have no right to minimum wage. They are here because at any wage, they make more than they did in their home county. Want a minimum wage or better? Get in line and come here legally. "Overall, immigration is good for the country in myriad ways, including its effects on the wages of most workers." You forget the key word just before immigration: Legal.	Immigrants are here illegally and should not make minimum wage. The legal immigration process should be adhered to.
15976233	America is the richest nation in the world, nearly twice as rich as we were on a per capita basis just 20 years ago. My resentment is with the hording of resources by a small number of Americans for their own benefit. The GOP supports local control, especially for schools, so the rich won't have to pay the taxes it costs to have a civilized society.	America is the richest nation in the world, twice as much as we were per capita 20 years ago.
15975481	So the 65% of my ridiculously large real estate tax bill that goes to the school district should be increased whenever someone comes over our border crying whatever? We need faster deportation and less tolerance for this scam game where our own children are being shortchanged while illegal immigrants soak up all the resources in our towns, cities and country. Enough. Stop the flow by eliminating the benefits.	Illegal immigrants crowd the schools which in turn causes higher property taxes. Our children are being denied while illegal immigrants take all the resources in our communities.
15981217	Immigration certainly does not affect all Americans equally. I can't think many ways at all that I am adversely affected. I have never experienced crime, violence or job loss due to immigrants. My local school system has to finance the cost of dealing with the influx of immigrants, but many of them are also bringing up the local test scores. For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also.	It's difficult to think of reasons why an individual such as myself is negatively affected by it. Immigration has not personally caused any problems. Immigrants increase cost however they bring improvement with them. A combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages, and moving manufacturing back from overseas would cost less than a border wall and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants.
15974201	Some evidence would be helpful here. Without it, I do not believe that illegal immigrants are taking jobs that citizens would do. Anyone unemployed reading this that's willing to pick fruit in the hot sun for $5 an hour ? Please chime in.	I do not believe that illegal immigrants are taking jobs that citizens would do. Citizens are unwilling to do the work of immigrants.
14166865	I expect Randall gets paid plenty to say these things. I'd put it more bluntly. It is win-win for the oil companies. They privatize the profits and if something bad happens, at worst they pay a token amount -- the real cost will be borne by taxpayers and by irreversible damage to the environment. Damn it feels good to be an oil man! (apologies to the Geto Boys)	It would be a big win for the oil industry, they can drill and make profits and at the very worst, they pay a fine if there are any damages. This would damage the environment and cost taxpayers.
14166293	Why was this lobbyist published without at least asking them we they won't also lobby for true best practices. We learned in the gulf what can go wrong. Well the Atlantic is stormier. So what new technology exists to quickly contain a spill? In the late 1950s there was an oil tanker incident in the Atlantic. All I remember about it is my mother bringing nail polish remover to the beach to clean off the tar balls from our legs.	If we cannot drill for oil in the Gulf without mistakes then  Atlantic offshore drilling would be much harder.
14164520	Finding all the earth's hydrocarbons and burning them as fast as possible is not long range planning. Free energy collection technologies (solar, wind, tidal, hydro) are practical alternatives to the depletion of hydrocarbon resources. Leave them in place. Future generations will appreciate that they have something left to use for organic chemistry that we can't imagine yet.	It is dangerous to our future to destroy more natural area. We should not be drilling for hydrocarbon when have other energy collection options. We need to preserve nature for future generations.
14166329	The fact that the newspaper of record can host a debate on the proposed expansion of off-shore drilling, with all we know about climate change, with the history of the BP disaster, should be all the proof anyone needs that we have a sick, greed-driven group of people making and reporting on our energy and economic policies. Unless the people rise up and challenge this insanity, people like Rob Whittman will see to it that we leave our children with a very bleak future.	This newspaper hosting a debate about expansion of off-shore drilling proves the people of this paper and law makers are sick and greedy.
14165508	"I -... - would not support the idea if I doubted our ability to put environmental safeguards in place." Putting "environmental safeguards" in place and preventing disasters are not the same thing. Standard, well intentioned engineering practice in oil production, refining, and transport includes safeguards like double and triple redundant fail safe systems. Still, engineered systems fail and all too recently we've had well-head blowouts (Deep Water Horizon), refinery explosions and fires, and oil transport disasters ranging from pipeline ruptures to tank train derailments to the Exxon Valdez. Imagine a perfect storm situation off Virginia Beach where a well head blowout coincided with a Hurricane Sandy. Crude oil from the Chesapeake to Iceland and a potentially mortal blow to already fragile shore communities and fisheries along the way. The only way to be 100% sure that the East Coast won't suffer catastrophic damage from oil production is to outlaw the outlandishly risky exploitation of hydrocarbons in our salty ocean waters.	Environmental safeguards do not prevent a disaster. Standard oil production practice includes safeguards and fail safe systems. Oil pipelines frequently fail and produce leaks, as with Deep Water Horizon and Exxon Valdez, thus the Atlantic coast should not be open to drilling. This would endanger the communities and fisheries of the area. Outlawing the exploitation of hydrocarbons in our ocean waters is the only way to ensure that the East Coast won't suffer damage from oil production.
14164442	Now would be a good time to begin instituting a serious conservation program to obviate the need for whatever oil might be found off shore in the Atlantic. What's so good about more oil? It is polluting the planet to a dangerous degree, we lust for it to the extent of going to war for it. Our modern civilization runs on machines that run on it. But there are realistic alternatives that can be developed. Going after more oil instead merely perpetuates a sunk cost fallacy that says we are in too deep to try something else and further enriches a few corporations at the expense of our shared planet. The earth is a finite place and everything in it is of limited quantity. Sooner than you think we will have no choice but to explore other options. Why wait until there is a crisis?	More oil isn't necessarily good. The planet is already being polluted enough. There are, in fact, other alternatives instead. Earth  is a finite place, it is of limited quantity.
14166450	Unless we can start to make climate change a bigger part of conversations like these, we will never actually take the steps necessary to decrease carbon emissions before we commit ourselves to catastrophic levels of warming/ocean acidification. How was that left out here? It's like to a whole bunch of powerful people, climate change is something to be discussed in the context of bad emissions by developing nations, but never with regard to actually changing patterns of domestic production or consumption by the developed nations that did the most to get us where we are.	Climate change should be a part of discussions about drilling on the Atlantic coast.
14166276	Look at the record snowfall in Boston and its economic consequences. Look at the record cold coming up in Raleigh. Look at the devastating consequences of the drought in California. Look at what is happening in Sao Paulo in Brazil. We must get off fossil fuels and we must do it as soon as we can. Drilling for oil off the coast is not the answer. More solar, wind and conservation are the answer. We need to wake up before it is too late for the future of this planet. Our kids are counting on us to do the right thing.	There will be economic consequences. We must get off fossil fuels. Solar and wind power along with conservation are the answer.
16961730	Take religion out of the equation and ask why any country should welcome people who believe that 50% of the population is inferior to the other half. But add religion to it and suddenly anyone who objects to importing more immigrants with these abhorrent beliefs is a 'racist' and 'xenophobe'. Political correctness and cowardice will be the death of the civilized world.	Political correctness as well as cowardice are what America should be afraid of.
16960657	How many Muslims have been killed in terror attacks so far in the us -Zero but how man americans have been killed in Islamic terrorist attacks so far not sure but around 3,500-4,000 and that not counting the arm forces over seas who are killed by terrorist bombings.	No Muslims have been killed in terrorist attacks. Many Americans are dying because these issues.
16964122	"Justifiable fear of terrorist attacks?" Certainly not justified by reality or statistics. Certainly not rational. Justified only by the fear itself. Since I arrived in the United States in 1975 I have been constantly surprised by the easy fears that seem to affect and are expressed in different ways by a large section of the population. It has always intrigued me because the American stereotype is the opposite.	Fear of terrorist attacks might not be justifiable. There is no rational justification in the fear or statistics.
16962419	If 1941's liberals thought the way any number of liberals and leftists think today: December 8th, 1941. FDR stands before Congress, asking for a declaration of war against Japan. The ships in Pearl Harbor still spewing smoke. But a huge delegation of liberal democrats from the President's own party stand and denounce their own President. Two thousand Americans died yesterday, while eight thousand were murdered by their fellow Americans last year. Gun violence is a greater threat in the US than Japanese Imperialism, they declare with one thunderous voice. And so the US sues for peace on Japanese terms. Far fetched? Not in today's world, where any number of liberals begin their declarations that gun violence is a greater threat than terrorism by stating: after 9/11, in the years after 9/11, if one counts the number of Americans killed by terrorists after 9/11...Completely discounting 9/11, because the terrorists didn't use any guns.	Americans have a  right to be afraid 8000 were killed by their own last year and 2000 died yesterday.
10949342	The banks made deliberate decisions that they correctly believed would increase their profits immensely if nothing blew up on them and would increase their profits moderately if they were caught and had to pay modest fines. No matter what they did, the banks and their management would make out like successful bandits while others would suffer. Reforms have not appeared to change the dynamics because the reforms that are politically feasible to the vast majority of the legislators taking contributions from the banks are ones that are acceptable to the banks. I expect until there is personal responsibility by the bank management all the incentives are toward risky behavior. Under these conditions, I don't see how a bank that didn't engage in risky behavior could compete. Nationalizing banks would make it clearer than ever that the banks were too big to fail (and could engage in even more risky behavior on more profitable terms than their competitors who lacked the too big to fail guarantee).	Banks will always end up successful. Reforms in banking haven't changed the dynamics. Legislators taking contributions from banks will only support reforms that are acceptable to banks. Incentives for bank management support risky behavior with no personal responsibility. Big Banks are out of control because if they are not, they cannot compete with the banks that take big risks. Banks are becoming too big to fail.
10945708	The Fed provides discounted money to banks to encourage lending, which will encourage investment, which will encourage jobs, which will encourage spending and more jobs. This process is broken because excess world capacity in labor and off shore productivity is sopping up all of the spending and the banks are putting their investment in risk fee bonds. Why not a nationalized bank that pays a premium, over any commercial bank, to long term (retirement) depositors, who are U.S. citizens (not corporations), that is solely dedicated to funding U.S. infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, dams, housing)? This plan encourages saving by U.S. citizens (the kind that breath), retains jobs and spending on U.S. soil, and the increased productive enhancement realized by such projects remain in the U.S..	Big banks are so out of control it is just all broken. Big banks are often not in compliance with regulations.
10944255	How to start re regulating? What's the difference between this now, where the govt itself seems to have no power over the banks, despite public opinion, and the banking S&L crisis when hundreds were prosecuted and jailed? Clinton started the deregulation of banks in the 90s. Lobbying and campaign donations have hugely increased, esp since the 2010 court decision. How can the govt untangle itself from the corporate hold on its powers? It's as if the govt is really regulated by the banks and corporations, rather than the govt regulating the banks. And all in the name of 'free speech' and free private enterprise. And in this bad economy with huge unemployment, the banks threaten more joblessness and recession if they are not left to do as they please. Where's the rebuttal in our main media? The majority of the public is anti big bank and want to break them up. The democracy isn't working.	The government seems to have no control over the banks, and it is no different than the S&L crisis that resulted in hundreds being prosecuted and jailed. The government is regulated by banks and corporations instead of governments actually regulating banks. Even in this bad economy they threaten jobs and foretell recession if not given their way. Most of the public doesn't like big bank.
10945584	Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial system recently, they no longer pose any such threat. That is illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly.	JPM didn't control it's traders or know what they were doing. More regulations need to be passed to regulate these big banks and punish them for wrongdoing. There is a lack of control in banks.
10948971	The bank CEO's were never made to answer for the crime they committed when they knowingly bundled bad mortgages and sold them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Eventually the housing market crashed and home owners ended up with homes worth about a third of the mortgaged debt. Our economy is still reeling from the effects of this boondoggle and only the homeowner has been punished by having his credit ruined in this deal. Most lifetime earnings were lost as a result and the big banks are still wheeling and dealing as pre usual in the new mortgage schemes they have put together today. What happened to the funds the Federal Government gave the banks to assist those in underwater home mortgages? Only the banks profited from this bailout, and no one else! Break the big banks up just as was done with ATT many years ago.	Big Banks are not held accountable for the problems that they have caused so cannot be controlled. Big banks caused the housing market crash. Our economy is still suffering from big banks. Big banks are still operating same as ever with their new mortgage schemes. Big banks will only look out for themselves and then drain the government when they fail.
10948828	Simple !. We live in democracy and capitalism. Under the this two norms, we have to maintain the free competition. The other hand, financial institutions have became the indispensable organ of the nation and common economy. Administration obligate to manage this financial system work to both whole nation's economy and citizen's good. Ultimately nature will demand financial system should be under the direct control of administration. But can you accept that concept? No, so, Financial institutions should be return the position that first of all institution had began the first. First, separate again Investment bank and place under the strict jurisdiction and supervision.	Big banks are crucial to modern finance. The government should work to monitor the financial system for the benefit of all citizens.
10948075	The question is not if "Are Big Banks Out of Control"? why bother asking a rhetorical question. The correct questions should be: 1. Who and what else do these bankers control besides the Big Banks? 2. Why does a nation of 300 plus million people watch in silent obedience this farce where not a single person is even indicted let alone sent to jail for an economic crime of a century if not the country's lifetime that devastated millions of people and is continuing to do so?	Why does a nation of 300 plus million people watch in silence? Not a single person is indicted,  let alone sent to jail, an economic crime of the century that devastated millions of people , and continues to do so.
10944652	It should be clear by now that, given enough slack in their leash, the banks will take the path of highest leverage without concern for risk. Look at how they all copied Countrywide Financial so they could get a larger share of feed at the trough. Of course this will always end with the US taxpayer baling them out and financing hideously large bonuses to those that risked everyone else's money and lost. We desperately need the Glass Steagall wall between deposits and investments. It would also be a big help if we implement a method to lower income inequality so that unsustainable amounts of personal debt are required to prop up our economy. Remember when Chairman Greenspan testified on TV in a Senate hearing and urged existing homeowners to tap into their equity? The rapid rise in personal debt in the form of credit card debt, mortgages and student loans is feeding these to-big-to fail financial behemoths that throw their weight around Washington.	If allowed to banks would be into the highest leverage regardless of risk. US tax payers will have to continue to bail out large poorly managed banks. There is a large rise of debt feeding big banks.
10944418	What the settlements and the lack of criminal prosecution for those humans who made the decisions to engage in wrong doing is that there is at least on class of humans who get to lie, cheat and still with no consequences. In fact, these miscreants get honored by the President and sweep into the offices of the very agencies tasked with regulating them to lecture agencies heads and staff about how regulation is wrong. And on top of all of this, taxpayers get to cover their losses, virtually pay the bloated compensation of their CEOs and lobbyists while the masters of the universe get to listen to their mouth pieces in Congress demean hard working Americans. Yep, these settlemts say a lot; none of it good for our country, our economy or most of the humans who work hard and cannot seem to get a head.	Settlements and lack of prosecution prove that bankers are the one class of humans who are not held accountable for their actions.
10947114	Nationalizing the banks would only move them from a bureaucracy that is too big to one that is even larger. If we do nationalize them, at least do it the way we created Government Motors, creating smaller leaner institutions. I would support the Warren-McCain Glass-Steagall Act update. The one issue overlooked in this discussion is the lobbying power of Wall Street bankers that is a roadblock to host of issues from tax reform to their War on the Poor to regulation. Could I suggest that a change in the phraseology from Too Big to Fail to Too Big to Regulate?	If we nationalize banks they would be run by the bureaucracy.
10951533	I would imagine Mr Bove would have said many of the same things about Lehman Brothers in early September 2008. Sometimes too big is also too dangerous despite profitability. There's way too much control not only of the economy but of the politics when banks get as powerful as the two he references. Furthermore, I suspect that if those giant banks were broken up, smaller more local/regional banks would hire every one of those employed by JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, etc. Not only that, but their economies of scale actually reduce the total potential employees mini-banks would need to operate. And those mini-banks would be beholden to their communities such that they'd more likely be rigorous in compliance with regulations.	Even though they are largely profitable, they have gotten too big to be safe. Banks pay large fees instead of complying with rules. They operate in such a large economy that it makes it almost impossible for smaller banks to succeed. Smaller banks are more likely to be rigorous in compliance with regulations, as they are beholden to their community.
10116658	Not only single payer but doctors must be on salary with no incentives for overtreatment and doctors should make the medical decisions based on medicine, not what the patients want or their employers or their lawyers. What we got was what one would expect when a bunch of Ivy League wing tipped lawyer lobbyists wrote it. I wonder how the lawyers would like the doctors to come up with Obamalaw......national legal care!!!	We need a single payer system with doctors on salary with no incentives for overtreatment.
10102331	Single payer is the obvious solution. We have a single payer system here in the Czech Republic. I can choose my doctor. I receive good care quickly. I had elective surgery one time, received it within a week. The system works. The US system does not, and will not, even under ObamaCare, because of the for-profit insurance industry.	ObamaCare will not work because of the for profit insurance industry.
10094946	This is a prime example of the best being an enemy of the good. Well, maybe good is to kind, but better is certainly apt. While I agree 100% that single payer is the right approach, it isn't in the cards now or any time soon. So,do we lift our middle finger to an incremental move in the right direction, or do we bull-up and demand what we can't get? If you need to think about this, you're part of the problem.	Obamacare is not working because it doesn't make a single payer system and the system is not ready for that change.
10095324	Obamacare is a second-rate plan. These writers are imminently correct in stating that a single-payer plan is far and away the better system. Leaving the private insurance companies in the loop and paying them 20% off the top was a gross mistake. They are in it for the money, nothing else. A single-payer plan would remove the profit motive and provide better and cheaper coverage. The private companies have no motive to hold down costs since their part of the pot is assured.	It is not a top notch plan. Private insurance companies are in business for money. Obamacare doesn't work because it does not remove the profit motive like single payer would. The market allows companies to raise prices at their leisure, there is no motivation for them to keep costs reasonable across the board.
10100991	The low rates quoted by the Administration don't include total cost, which in the case of the lowest cost policies include high deductibles and co-pays. The other shell game is that delivering many young and healthy new insureds will offset the cost to the insurance companies of no pre-existing condition restrictions. With high premiums many young people will ignore the law or choose to pay the alternative tax. Insurance companies will not lose money; if enough young people don't sign up premiums will rise or companies will stop participating.	Obamacare used low rates as a shell game to hide high deductibles and co-pays. Obamacare is being deceptive with their reporting practices and cost figures. The high cost of premiums will drive younger healthy people to avoid purchasing the insurance and instead pay the tax penalty. Insurance companies will increase premiums or stop participating if they don't have enough people who sign up, rather than lose money.
10096095	The claim that millions of Americans are being moved to part time jobs because of Obamacare is simply not true. the move to part time work spiked with the catastrophe of 2008 (back when Obamacare was still a conservative Republican plan) and has since remained at that plateau. The rest of the article is also regurgitated dishonest babble, but it gets so tiring having to refute these liars point by point.	Part time work was already on the rise before Obamacare was passed.
10092396	" Congress should delay the law for a year..."? Tell that to my niece whose 17 month old toddler has just been diagnosed with a rare disease that will need years of medical care. Without the provisions in the new health care law, this family would be facing bankruptcy. I prefer living in a nation where we have the decency to realize that health care is a right. Obviously those who seem to be objecting to the new health care law have never faced what 30 million people face in our country every day. For them another year's delay is life or death.	The new healthcare law helps save families money. I want to live in a country where we accept health care is a right.
10100881	I can't help but wonder how many of these problems might have been fixed if the Republicans in Congress had made a legitimate effort to help fix them, rather than devoting all of their efforts to throwing up roadblocks and trying to defund it. It's really hard to build something when you have to deal with someone else trying to tear it down at the same time.	Many problems might be fixed if Republican congressmen made an effort to fix them rather than obstructing and attempting to defund it. It's hard to build something when you deal with someone else trying to tear it down.
10099723	Sure, Medicare for all would have been a better option, but that couldn't be sold. This is the best that could have been done under the circumstances and circumstances are not likely to change anytime in the foreseeable future. It is what it is - Deal with it.	It would have been better for everyone to have Medicare, but we couldn't convince everyone of that. It's the best we could do with circumstances aren't likey to change soon.
10098902	What Chris Jacobs is really saying is that he hates a plan that the Heritage Foundation developed that was the basis of much of first Romenycare and Obamacare. I agree that there was a much simpler and better plan out there and I am a beneficiary of it and can tell you that it works real well for our family It's called Medicare and it will can serve us well as a common sense model for our entire population.	Medicare for all is a much better alternative to Obamacare.
10099651	How can this be the so called 'law of the land' when there are so many waivers and exemptions ? Give me an example of another global law that only applies to certain Americans? As such I think the law is invalid and the real attack should be for injunctive relief to force the administration to rescind the waivers or the law is nullified.	There are too many waiver and exemptions for this to be the law.
10099242	I live in Maryland (DC suburb) and my wife and I are on it. It greatly lowered our costs. Our children were able to go on it until they each found jobs with their own health care. We love Obamacare and so will everyone. It's doing exactly what it's supposed to do, and it has freed people where one family member has a pre-existing condition to change employment, thus helping the economy. The Republicans don't want it to go into effect precisely because they know it will expose them as frauds.	Obamacare lowered costs and children were able to utilize it until employment was found. Obamacare has allowed people with pre-existing conditions to change employment.
10098012	I am fully insured on my own and help finance Obamacare too. And I don't regret. Such obligations are imperative for a civilized society and a nation. These obligations pale in comparision with,( like all citizens do),the benefits, advantages and rights I enjoy at the same time. In fact, what I want is a far less complicated, straight-forward, far more liberal and universally applicable health care system that is at least comparable to what are obtaining presently in France,UK and Scandinavia.I don't mind the personal costs,no one should, I believe.It is the basic minimum that any nation should render to its citizens.And it could prove to be quite cheaper than whatever provided by any insurance company and far more efficient, if wisely administered. Anyway, I personally believe, ofcourse buttressed by my own calculations and ratified by my intellectual friends, that the rich are indeed the free loaders in any society, extracting far higher benefits from it than what they themselves contribute.But they make the maximum noise and grossly distort the reality for denying the middle class and the poor what they richly deserve-- through rational logic and by canons of progressive civilizations.	While not perfect, Obamacare provides healthcare for some people that would otherwise not be able to afford health insurance.
10095919	The status quo ante prior to Obamacare was that healthcare was a complete perversion of the free market and open competition. This country allowed insurance companies to corner the market on healthcare via insurance, to price medical treatment beyond the range of any individual to pay without insurance, and therefore to deny care and coverage to anyone with impunity. Obama has restored the balance by taking away the insurance companies' ability to block consumers from receiving medical care. He did it without the social violence that, by rights, should have accompanied such a revolutionary change. Obama actually initiated a return of healthcare to a free market, competitive status. But it required an acknowledgement that basic healthcare is a right that cannot be abridged.	Before Obamacare, the healthcare industry was completely ruled by market forces. Obamacare has removed insurance companies' ability to refuse coverage to consumers. Obamacare was a return of healthcare to the free market.
11654333	I don't know how Kristen Feemster can sleep at night. No amount of money is worth inflicting that damage by force. They always want to focus on the one person in an iron lung from 1947. How about you focus the attention on the 154 people paralyzed by the polio vaccine in the last 35 years, while nobody unvaccinated got polio? The scientists are anti-science, and they believe in Nazi medical experiments.	154 people were paralyzed by the polio vaccine, but no unvaccinated person got polio. Sometimes scientists do not believe in the scientific process.
11464074	I take issue with the idea that the only valid exemption aside from an individual medical issue is religious, which is the law in my state (MA). This means I can only exempt my children from vaccination requirements if I do NOT have an objection based on reason - it can only be a faith-based objection. I find it very condescending to be told that the thinking has already been done for me and I cannot think for myself but only follow the tenets of a religion. Why do we privilege religion as beyond questioning and reproach but have no respect for freedom of thought?	kids must take vaccination shot it helps with health issues.
11448878	It seems clear from reading the comments that the vaccine debate is falsely represented. While there are those who absolutely refuse any vaccinations, they are clearly in the minority. In fact, the vast majority of those who question the childhood vaccine schedule are looking most closely at a few of them, specifically Varicella, Flu, Hepatitis B and to some extent MMR. Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good. You don't need a medical degree to think critically about your family's health and to demand answers from vaccine manufacturers who are, frankly, not forthcoming with information.	People who are skeptical of the childhood vaccine schedule are looking closely at a few of them, specifically. We do not know enough about vaccines. It is unfair for families affected by vaccine injuries to say that their suffering is for the greater good. Vaccines manufacturers are not forthcoming with information and people can make their own decisions.
11417696	It is quite sad to see a doctor advocate for government coercion for something that every doctor acknowledges has its risks. How would this doctor propose to enforce this coercion, prison terms for parents who refuse to vaccinate? Stalking the kids and vaccinating them in the street? Providing each child with a vaccine record microchip? It would be one expensive government program to run. It seems a lot more reaction would follow and hence some real outbreaks. Peaceful persuasion seems to be a wiser alternative. Or, if an increased compliance is sought for the more serious diseases, such as pertussis, measles, polio, rubella, then offer separate vaccines that fewer parents would object to and eliminate the ludicrous vaccines from the compulsory list, by ludicrous I mean those that clearly might be doing more harm than good as is the case with the varicella vaccine and the hep B vaccines given routinely to babies of non-carrier mothers. The more such vaccines are forced, the more families react by complete refusal of vaccines.	Doctors advocate for vaccines even though they know they carry risks. There is no way to enforce manditory vaccination. Increasing the number of vaccinations for children causes more people to refuse to be vaccinated at all.
11411433	The United States of America is the most advanced country in terms of childhood vaccination. (that means, American children are the most heavily vaccinated in the world) And yet, more than half of that most vaccinated U.S. children suffer from chronic illnesses or obesity. Have you ever thought why? Wake up Americans.	Vaccinated children suffer chronic illness and obesity so that means vaccinations do not work.
11411383	the fact of the matter is it is our decision as parents to make the decision we feel best suits our children. if one chooses to vaccinate, that is their choice and i respect that they've made the difficult decision to protect their family by vaccinating. my choice however is to not vaccinate our children, as i feel i would be doing more harm to them than good. it's not an easy answer whichever you choose, but i am proud to be born in a country that allows me the freedom to make decisions regarding this. we as parents have researched the options fully, and are aware of both sides risks...and choose the lesser of the 2 evils for us.	Parents muse be able to choose what is best for their children and family. Vaccination does more harm than good. Parents can research options and want to have a say in making a choice.
11410953	Please show me the study that proves that vaccines are either safe or effective. There are no such studies, but there are many studies that cause me to question their safety, not to mention the thousands of cases of vaccine injury documented on the VAERS site. If vaccines are safe, why has our government given monetary compensation to thousands of vaccine injured families through the VICP program?	No study proves vaccines work. There are thousands of people injured by vaccines, and years of studies that make me question their safety. The government has given compensation to thousands of people injured by vaccines. They are not safe.
11408162	No Thank you. I do not EVER, want my government to force me to inject my children with anything. Many vaccines and eye drops for that matter, contain the carcinogen Mercury, which in later years can present as rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoma-like symptomology. And, people still today get polio from live but weakened polio virus vaccines... This has to remain individual choice. My child was allergic to Pertussis vaccine, but homeopathy protected my children much more than any vaccines could. It's educated parents that are needed, not forced vaccinations.	The government should not be able to force injections upon my children. Vaccinations should not be mandatory because they have mercury, a carcinogen which can cause symptoms similar to arthritis and lymphoma. Vaccinations can cause polio even in the weakened form. Vaccination should remain a personal choice. There can be allergies, and homeopathy is a better alternative. Parents need to be educated about forced vaccinations.
11408115	There should be no exeptions from vaccinations with the exception of valid medical exemptions i.e. an individual with a serious allergy to the vaccine for example an egg alergy in the case of the flu vaccine. Asside from that demonstratable allergy no exemptions for either personal belief or religion should be entertained. If I had my way vaccinations would be a part of a single payer national health system providing universal care. The private sector has proved itself to be incompetent to provide modern health care and need to step asside.	The only acceptable exemption should be a legitimate medical reason, such as a vaccine allergy.
11405532	Of course vaccines should be required for all children, despite whatever religious or philosophical reasons parents might have for withholding such preventative medical care from their children. Why? Because we live in a cooperative society where our actions have direct implications on the lives and wellbeing of others. Those "withholding" parents are no better than the selfish fools who won't get a flu shot because, "everyone else gets them, so I don't need to." Spanish Flu killed 20 million people, yet today's parents still have the gall to say the medical onus should be on others, not them. For all those parents out there who don't want your child immunized, try living for one year in a third- or fourth-world country where immunizations are rare (if they exist at all), and your kid is exposed to myriad diseases all but extinct in our society. You'd be terrified to let your kid play with neighborhood kids, yet here you think nothing of exposing other people's children to the same. Vaccinations should be mandatory. It's time religion and philosophy (which are one in the same) take a back seat to rationality and public health.	These vaccines are preventative medical care that are more important than religious or philosophical ideals. Vaccinations should be mandatory in a cooperative society were actions have a direct impact on others wellbeing. Parents who do not vaccinate their children should consider what it is like to raise a child in a more disease prevalent country.
11404549	The choice to abstain from vaccination tends to be based upon concerns about the additives and preservatives placed in the shots. I do not understand why my cat can get an additive free vaccine and my child cannot. How about demanding a change in the pharma industry to make the actual shots safer? There are known human carcinogens like formaldehyde and neurotoxins such as aluminum in many vaccines. Vaccine injuries are very real and a risk some are just not willing to take.	Abstaining from vaccination tends to be based on additives and preservatives in the shots. The pharmaceutical industry needs to change. Vaccination shouldn't be mandatory for children because many vaccines still contain dangerous chemicals like formaldehyde and neurotoxins. Some are not willing to take the risk of vaccine injuries.
11403407	I couldn't agree more. The decision of well-meaning but ignorant people to deprive their children of vaccinations endangers not just the children, but the children of others, and vulnerable adults. Our right to choose ends when those choices result in harm to others.	People who choose not to vaccinate their children endanger their children as well as others. If vaccinations are not mandatory then those making selfish choices will cause others to be harmed.
11408927	NO CHOICE ! John Stewart Mill defined freedom as all inclusive except when it infringes on that of others. So, if parents decided not to have their children vaccinated... OK. But this choice puts others at risk. It has been said that certain vaccines or combinations of them lead to autistic spectrum disorders based on anecdotal evidence. Though sincere these people know nothing about science and the scientific method and when two events occur simultaneously -- it may be the "false cause and effect fallacy." And in the present case this is what exactly is going on. And there is agreement about this in the medical and scientific community. Students in high school and college who take biology, chemistry, physics... are apt to learn just facts in favor of what the scientific method is all about.	Not vaccinating infringes on the rights of others. [Not vaccinating] puts others at risk.
11408919	"It is a news media-driven misperception that parents who claim philosophical or religious exemptions are uneducated or misinformed. MOST PARENTS WHO INDIVIDUALIZE THE VACCINE SCHEDULE ARE ACTIVELY EDUCATING THEMSELVES, CONTINUALLY ASSESSING THEIR FAMILY'S SPECIFIC HEALTH NEEDS, and doing everything they can to keep their children safe and healthy." Ms. Margulis offers no data to support her blanket assertion about the industry and motivation of "most parents," a position which, on its face, seems improbable given the breadth and weight of scientific evidence supporting immunization which is not subject to reasonable dispute. Based on anecdotal information, "most parents" are refusing to vaccinate their children based on their gross misunderstandings and unwarranted fears of the alleged risks of immunization, or based on their unique interpretations of religious dictates. If you intend to offer relevant commentary, Ms. Margulis, it should be evidence-based. Your personal opinions are no more interesting (or informed) than mine.	Vaccination should not be mandatory because informed parents make sure to educate themselves so they can make the best choices for their individual child. Most parents are refusing to vaccinate.
11408807	I am a libertarian, but this is not a purely self-regarding choice. RC is right. This is a choice that might endanger others. If a parent's failure to allow their children to be vaccinated creates a transmission belt for an infectious disease, then the parent should be liable for the consequences of their choice. Moreover, the parent who won't let their child be vaccinated is a free rider. Other parents are accepting a minuscule -- but real risk -- of an adverse reaction to the vaccination. Their decision helps to protect the child of the free-riding parent because the vaccinated child serves as a sort of firebreak to slow the spread of the disease.	Unvaccinated children endanger others. Anyone refusing to vaccinate children should be liable for any disease or death they cause. The risk of an adverse reaction is small.
11408793	If, as the author suggests, "Most parents who individualize the vaccine schedule are actively educating themselves, continually assessing their family's specific health needs, and doing everything they can to keep their children safe and healthy," then why are we having these outbreaks? It is apparent that whatever these parents are doing is not working, and in the interest of public safety, it is time for meaningful legislation to ensure that these preventable diseases are indeed prevented.	Vaccination should be mandatory because non vaccination is not working. Legislation should protect children from preventable diseases.
11407484	I agree that parents (and the kids, once they're old enough--say, 16) should have the right to opt in or out of SOME vaccinations--namely, ones for diseases that are hard to spread. Hepatitis B? HPV? Be my guest--that choice only affects your family, because those are not diseases your kid can spread at school, on the bus, etc. But no one without a medical exemption should be able to opt out of vaccinations against HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, very dangerous diseases like German measles, pertussis/whooping cough, mumps (which can leave little boys permanently infertile), etc. Measles can live on surfaces like classroom desks and the metal handles people hold in buses for several hours. Nobody has the right to expose complete strangers to devastating diseases that are so easy to prevent.	Without a medical exemption, no one should be able to opt of vaccines. Not vaccinating your child exposes others to risk from preventable illnesses.
11405667	The problem is the cost of non-vaccination is not borne by the dissenting parents, but by the sickened and possibly dead injured by the loss of herd immunity. If someone does not want their children to be vaccinated, that person should be required to post a bond to cover the potential damages. A bond should also be required by individuals claiming religious exemptions.	Problem is the cost of non-vaccination is not borne by the refusing parents, but by the loss of herd immunity. People should be financially responsible for their choices on vaccination.
11405435	"An American parent could reasonably decide not to follow the C.D.C.'s current vaccination schedule by choosing to vaccinate on the schedule they use in Norway, which has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world." You don't come close to explaining how it's "reasonable" for a parent to second guess the CDC's recommended schedule. Do you have actual evidence that the potential risk of infant vaccines outweighs the risk of the diseases they prevent? It seems not.	Do you have evidence that the risk of vaccinating infants is greater than the risk of disease.
11404235	Both the child and the rest of the population have a right to be protected against Communicable diseases that can result in Deafness, blindness, paralysis, mental retardation and death. Newborns, immune-compromised adults, and the unvaccinated are protected by herd immunity. If all parents decided to forgo vaccination for their children, our infant and child mortality rates would soar. By the way, Breast feeding has no protective value against tetanus, diphtheria, measles, or whooping cough.	We all have a right to be protected against communicable diseases which cause serious issues or death. Herd immunity protects against those that cannot be vaccinated. Vaccinations save lives. Breast feeding does not confer immunity to the illnesses we immunize for.
11404377	We still haven't addressed the problem of children who come from other countries into America and have not had the advantage of early childhood vaccinations. We are seeing cases of measles, mumps, etc. increase, and this cannot be all the fault of those who have lived with and been in contact daily in this country since birth with their peers who have been vaccinated. I'm old, and when in 1st grade, I contacted German measles. NOT from someone in my class and, in fact, no one seemed to know where I contacted it. I then proceeded to infect almost all my entire class apparently. My point in telling this story is that we cannot know exactly where a child gets his contact, and therefore IMO opinion, vaccinations should be mandatory for every child entering schools from pre-K up. Until everyone - from the child who comes with their parents to America to the kiddo next door, we have to be consistent.	Some children come to America from other places who have not had early childhood vaccinations. Cases of measles, mumps and other diseases are increasing. Vaccination of school children is important and should be mandatory because it is impossible to tell where a child might contract a preventable disease. All children should be vaccinated for the sake of consistency.
11403606	The choice of whether to breastfeed is of little consequence to others. Not to vaccinate one's children places others at risk, particularly other children and health-compromised adults. The analogy used by the author doesn't hold up. I'm also willing to bet that in Norway the overwhelming majority of young children are inoculated.	Unvaccinated children places others at risk. I believe the kids in Norway get vaccinations.
11403441	"Unlike in the United Arab Emirates, in America we believe parents are capable of making their own decisions about their children's health. We believe in freedom of choice. This freedom of choice extends to when - and even whether- parents vaccinate their kids." Oh really? I seem to remember reading about several recent outbreaks of formerly all but eradicated viruses putting the health and lives of many at risk because of the so called "capable" choices. And this recent choice is rather new. When I was a child back in the 70sI had to get a back-up MMR shot or be denied access to school. What has changed is organized and ill-informed parents pushing back politically to gain exemptions from sound public policy that has protected the American public for generations. Individual choice should not dominate here. We need herd immunity to ensure our society is protected from serious and even fatal diseases. Parents need to be better educated but I don't think we need to continue to allow ever larger groups of children to go without vaccinations - not only for the broader American public but also those children themselves.	In recent years, there have been a few outbreaks of viruses that were once all but eradicated and they can be blamed on people who make "capable" choices. People should not have a choice. Herd immunity is vital to protect society. Parents should be better educated, but children still need to be vaccinated.
11407412	I am a health care worker and I have to get a flu shot because it is federally mandated. I have no choice; I have to get the shot. I would get a flu shot anyway but it does not feel good to be forced, it makes me very angry. I strongly believe in immunization and believe people should be encouraged and educated about why immunizations are important but I don't think forcing people is the right answer. I also believe that schools and day care centers should have the right to refuse to accept kids who have not been immunized.	Flu shots should not be mandatory. Forcing people to vaccinate isn't right even though I personally believe in vaccinations.
11404562	People should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on others when it would harm or endanger others. Parents should not be able to deprive their children of medical care, like vaccinations, and employers should not be able to deny their employees of medical care, like contraception.	Imposing your religious beliefs on others can harm or endanger others. Parents shouldn't be able to take away medical care like vaccinations from their children.
11404170	Why does Jocelyn Elders support religious exemptions from vaccination requirements? This not only endangers public health, but also violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in my opinion. I don't approve of any exemptions. But if religious exemptions are permitted under a state's law, than so also should non-religious exemptions. Providing preferential treatment solely for religion is unconstitutional. It would be like exempting churches--and only churches--from property taxes.	Religious exemptions for vaccinations should not be allowed. Not vaccinating endangers the public and violates the establishment clause of the first amendment. I don't agree with any of the exemptions. The rights of non-religious Americans are being violated.
11405775	People in the US listen more closely to the rantings of a former Playboy model than they do their doctor. Americans tend to believe more in pseudoscience because of ignorance. These two things are driving the loss of herd protection from diseases long thought virtually eradicated in the US.	It is unwise to listen to a model as opposed to medical professionals. Americans often are ignorant and believe in pseudoscience. Vaccination should be mandatory for kids because diseases that were considered eradicated are now popping up in the US population.
11914230	Mr. Jaffe seems to be confusing three very different situations. Parents of minor children already have the right to know what is going on with their children's care. And people who have been appointed as legal guardians (conservators of person) also have this right; naturally, that includes parents of adults who have been judged incompetent to manage their own affairs (in probate court), unless someone else (such as a spouse, adult child, lawyer, or physician) takes that responsibility. Done deal! The third case is that of an adult who suffers from a mental illness but has not been found legally incompetent. That person has exactly the same rights and responsibilities as anyone else. Of course one's doctors, lawyers, accountants, priests, and (for that matter) barbers do not communicate with our parents about one's decisions! Why should they? Mr. Jaffe seems to think that we should have a new law that would sidestep the need to establish that a person is, in fact, psychiatrically disabled. That is a dangerous road indeed.	Parents of young children are already granted the privileged of knowing every aspect of their child's care. A mentally ill, competent adult has the same rights and responsibilities as anyone else.
11917910	All human beings are a potential threat. There are those who are honest about aggressive feelings and thoughts and those who deny and conceal. Imminent threat is a other matter. Tarasoff properly recognizes some responsibility to third parties but offers tremendous leeway to deal with that--reporting to the police is one option and usually the most ineffective and destructive. Involving family and others in the patients supportive social environment usually is far more effective and, even when done dispite objection by the patient, may preserve the therapeutic relationship. This risk is usually not confined to the moment but is at least in part characteriological and sustained. Mandating reporting to he authorities makes psychotherapists functionaries in an increasingly militarized police state. Might as well just outlaw psychotherapy outright as no real psychotherapy can occur in such an oppressive setting.	The laws are tough enough and the patient's family and support system are more effective in helping the patient to not become violent. Mandatory reports would make a psychotherapists job useless.
11913541	Still fail see how this would have necessarily prevented this horrific event. This would only work if the patient actually tells a mental health professional that he or she wants to harm someone (targeted individuals or in general). There's no evidence that Rodger ever communicated any such feelings to his therapists except a few minutes before he started killing. There is substantial evidence that he knowingly and willfully lied to police, withholding entirely his intent to harm. He demonstrated enough mental capacity and control to have hidden his real intent from his therapists, too. He plotted for well over a year without anyone else knowing. Unless he told his therapists in advance that he felt like shooting up a sorority house or the community, your proposed measures, even if already in place, would not have stopped it.	The patient needs to be forthcoming for this to work. Laws that are already in place should prevent violence.
11913257	I find this discussion tremendously beside the point. Some good ideas here that parents should be more in the loop and that mental health professionals should have adequate support for sharing information with law enforcement. And THEN WHAT? Presupposing that these things could be predicted, it is extraordinarily difficult to have someone involuntarily committed for psychiatric treatment and that commitment does not last long. Police can't imprison someone because their therapist or parents think they might do something dangerous. As long as we make guns easily available, we are not even trying to stop this. They have psychotic people in other countries and many fewer murders.	Parents should be more involved with their children's lives. It is difficult to be committed involuntarily, and these commitments are usually short. We aren't trying to stop violence because we are making guns available. A therapist can't have a person imprisoned because they think they are dangerous.
11912768	Hold on. Reporting concerns to police is not very effective if the police are not very well trained to respond. Very few police departments have the funds (or priorities) to provide special training for dealing with mentally ill/disturbed people. Too often mentally ill people are tasered, assaulted, or shot unnecessarily. And patients who are reported to law enforcement often feel, understandably, betrayed by the person who reports them, leading them to stop treatment--or at least stop being honest about their thoughts and feelings.	The police may not be trained to respond to concerns once reported. Authorities have little to no training in dealing with mentally ill people. If people seeking helped are betrayed by their therapist they will leave treatment or be dishonest which will not help them.
11912503	I think our, so called, entertainment industry is conditioning our young to more violence and radical behavior. In the case of all irrational behavior... More aggressive action must be taken when family or authorities see unusual behavior. In this case his parents recognized his problems, had concern, and notified law enforcement. The sad thing is he conned law enforcement and they took no action at all. In this case he should have been forced to seek professional help. Law enforcement does not have the experience or capability to make decisions as to mental capacity or stability.	Families and authorities should take irrational behavior more seriously. Law enforcement lacks sufficient experience to determine a person's mental capacity or stability.
7957857	As a former teacher and long-time first grade volunteer in a low income school district, I regularly use the CLEVNET system to get books for our class that compliment our curriculum or that are about subjects in which the kids express interest. We develop a reading list of the books shared each year, and let kids know they have access to them all through our local library. For communities in which books are an unaffordable luxury, libraries level the playing field, giving access to unlimited literary riches to all. In our community, they also provide much needed parenting help through story times and reading activities for caregivers and young children every week. Many families without computers at home get access to the internet at the library for homework help, employment and tax information. While libraries may be redundant for more affluent families, they provide a window into a different present and future for those of lesser means.	They provide supplemental materials for curriculum to both teachers and students. Libraries level the playing field for people who cannot afford books. Libraries provide much needed activities for caregivers and young children in communities. Libraries provide internet for those that need it to do homework, find employment, and file taxes. Libraries give a chance for poorer families to get information and reading material.
7957258	Librares are more than places for reading, borrowing books and recordings, and doing research. They are community centers of wisdom. And as such, they are the intellectual aspect of overall community health. When policy makers (providing funding for libraries) understand this aspect, libraries and their surrounding communites, thrive.	They are the intellectual aspect of overall community health.
7952992	The seats in the Central Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library are filled with high school and college students reading, researching, and completing assignments.I used the library in the same way, as a quiet place in a crowded city away from a crowded apartment with little private space when I was teenager living in the Bronx in the nineteen sixties. The space is free, the walls are lined with books, and you can travel around the world, back in time, and to distant planets during your breaks. I once had a high school teacher who took points off of a report because I did not include pictures. I explained that the library did not allow you to cut pictures out of the magazines. He did not seem to understand. People who do not understand what libraries mean for working class youth are too blinded by their privileges. For working class youth the library is like a small piece of heaven.	Public libraries are filled with students seeking knowledge and learning. With books, an individual can travel all around the world without leaving the room. Libraries provide access to books to minority children.
7954757	I don't sure next generation will read printing books or not. but I needed to visit library. browsed the books handle the new arrivals doing this every week I experienced mental satisfaction.That kind of joy I never experienced on Internet. ,may be old habit never die..For references libraries are essential.There is other advantages of Libraries you can meet there book lovers we can enjoy discussion on book,exchange idea ,may some time debate .Can it possible on virtual world?	Libraries provide satisfaction to people. Libraries are essential for references and can provide a joy never experienced on the internet. Yes, we still need libraries because there are many advantages they offer. There is social interaction at libraries.
7952666	Information has moved from print to digital. That does not mean it is free or that it is easily located. Stop equating libraries with print. The point of most libraries never was to serve as a storage space. Unless you are a librarian or work at a library, you probably don't realize that everything in a library, including computers, wifi, online journals, and ebooks, is there as a carefully curated collection created to meet the needs of the people who use it. What you do realize is that when you walk into a library, or go there online, you find what you need and don't need to think very much about how that happened. Libraries serve the same purpose today that they have always served... to make information accessible to everyone through resources and services.	Libraries will keep print media alive. Don't equate libraries with print. Those familiar with libraries realize all the resources that have been carefully placed there to help people. Libraries have always been about making information available to all people.
7952465	Yes we need libraries. Public libraries provide so much more than just internet access, though that is an important service. Many libraries assist with literacy training, host book clubs, provide after school activities for children, give senior citizens on fixed incomes a place to borrow books they otherwise could not afford to read. Many libraries do dual duty as de facto community centers. Using the internet at home to do research is fine, Wikipedia is not a peer reviewed source that is accepted as a reference for many schools and universities. Scholarly databases that provide access to academic journals are available at libraries and are usually not affordable for most people. I could go on, but in short YES - we NEED libraries in our communities!	Public libraries provide much more than important internet access. Many libraries provide numerous valuable services to their communities. Libraries function as community centers, as well as lending out books.
7952451	Not only would enlightened libraries provide us with a more sensible approach to information, generally, it COULD be a great way to help us educate our children. The opportunity to access educational opportunities would be greatly enhanced and the cost of educating our children would drop dramatically. Each child at his or her own rate of accomplishment. It would catch on like wild fire.	Enlightened libraries could provide us with a sensible approach to information, it COULD be a great way to help us educate our children. We need opportunity to educated our children with opportunities like libraries.
7952064	Libraries are a place for word literate people to visit in the increasingly computer literate wasteland. In a world where we are increasingly ROTFL and LMAO in twitterese or emailese (sorry to make up these proto-language names), some people just want to read a book while surrounded by other books. We want to check them out of the library and bring them back and repeat the process. We are still in love with the comfort of the printed page on paper. If all you are using it for is computer access, stop. Get a cheap android tablet, go to McDonalds, buy lunch and a coffee, get the password from the manager and surf away. Next time you are there, sit in the browsing section and read something other than your electronic reader.	Libraries allow a sanctuary for those looking to escape technology. Some people like a social place to read. We want to be able to check items out of the library and return them. People still like reading printed pages.
7951873	Yes I'm wired and also have a Kindle and Netflix. Nevertheless I'm a heavy library user and can't imagine living in a community without these resources. My husband and I are now deciding where to retire -- just as we want a location with good medical facilities and an airport we also want a first class library system. We want to live in a community that respects literacy, reading and has good children's programs like story hour, etc.	I use the library often and it would negatively impact the community to lose these resources. Libraries promote good reading habits to children.
7951380	Libraries r important in the minority neigbborhoods. When one talks abt minority, the Asian immigrant neighborhoods are NEVER included, andyet these r occupied by new immigrants whose adults work 7 days a week, leaving children to non English grant parent as care takers.Libraries serve as a save haven for knowledge and learning during weekends and holidays. Library plan reading activities and children programs to entice young readers who would otherwise stayed home, watchng the junk programs on TV. What I do not understand is why libraries would find it necessary to provide Dvds of movies to be checked out! Isn't there enough outlets around for that without wasting public money to benefit Hollywood?	Libraries have great value in minority neighborhoods. When school is not in session, one can still gain knowledge and a peaceful environment in a library. Libraries draw children into reading rather than television.
7951620	The books, the computers, the storytimes, even the staff expertise are only elements of the emerging (or, more properly, continuing) role of the public library. The library is a community focal point and a community development agency. For decades, my colleagues in the field rode the wrong bus. Libraries and librarians sold themselves as information agents. Then we were blindsided by the development of do-it-yourself information tools. We forgot that our mandate is broader -- much broader -- than information. We are a place where people gather to connect to other people, to culture, to information, to works of art and works of the imagination. From an individual's perspective, that's enriching. From a community's perspective that's vital to the sustenance of vitality and diversity in the polity.	Libraries have many events and activities as well as expert staff which play a vital role in the community. The library brings community together as a center for development. Having a place to gather to connect to people, culture, information, and works of art is enriching and vital to the sustenance of vitality and diversity.
7950969	For the Homeless, libraries are also an increasingly important safety net: providing them with a warm place to get indoors on a cold day, newspapers, magazines and computers to let them look for a job or any other need they have, often with a means to make application for the same online. A friend of mine told me that she became homeless for a year and lived in her car. She said it was libraries that gave her a means to search and apply for the job she needed -- and won, getting off the street and into a small rented house again.	Libraries provide help for the homeless, including temporary shelter and career resources.
7948878	It will be a sad day for all of us when libraries become simply access points for the Internet. Libraries should be for books and reading, primarily, and all other activities secondarily. Plus the fact the most every library which I have ever had access to has funding problems. And libraries, like teachers and schools, are always the first to feel the cut of the budget axe. We are a strange society, and, I predict, one which is moving quickly downhill as did the old Roman Empire..........	It will be sad when libraries become only access points for the Internet. Libraries are essential for books and reading.
7950152	We definitely need libraries!! It was my safe sanctuary when I was chased as a kid by bullies on my way home from school. We definitely need both printed books and Internet access, and digital books accessible from home, too. However, everyone cannot afford the digital devices so public access from the library is necessary. We would be wise to put a library within walking distance of every American, and keep the library open 24/7. The library is the most valuable resource for lifelong learning.	Libraries are needed. Libraries can be safe havens for children. We need printed books and internet access from the home. Libraries are needed since everyone cannot afford digital access. Libraries are a wise addition. Libraries provide for lifelong learning.
7956728	I am always amazed at the number of people I see in a library. At the college where I teach, students pack the large computer center, use the stacks of books and study (just as I did 40 years ago) at the tables. The addition of small, private meeting rooms in our new facility allow students to congregate in study groups without disturbing others. Public libraries are also a hive of activity as people who struggle through the recession use the lending of books, movies and music to remain entertained at virtually no cost. Benjamin Franklin would be proud of this American legacy, yet so often it is the first to lose public funding. How sad that we take these institutions for granted and yet we refuse to provide for their necessary functions in our lives.	We need libraries because they offer computer centers, print books and a place to study. Libraries allow students to meet and collaborate. Public Libraries are good for those less fortunate, providing a nearly free source of different media's. Libraries are needed.
7951577	Aside from all the new and exciting ways libraries are giving their public access to information, I am in love with the fact that I can access books I would never buy just to see if I like them. If not, no wasted money or time. And sometimes I uncover new gems by this method. Something I didn't have the time to do at Borders. I love the fact that my library appears to be a hub for all kinds of learning and discussion. Where else in this money-driven world is there space for a community center that operates well and offers value to everyone?	Libraries are giving the public access to information in new and exciting ways. I can access books without having to buy them. My library has many kinds of learning available and provides a community space for everyone, which I love.
7948914	I didn't realize that libraries were an American invention. I knew that Benjamin Franklin established the first on in this country (almost enough to let me forgive him for floating the ghastly daylight savings time joke in Paris a few years later) and Andrew Carnegie is the only philanthropist I've heard of to devote his fortune to the cause. I thought we had just done our fair share in keeping up with our responsibilities. I don't use the library often, I'm too fond of instant gratification in book stores and too undisciplined to return books on time, but I'm convinced they are a great value in our communities and support them willingly. I also have more internet bandwidth than most libraries. Books and DSL are expensive. I may be crazy enough to put those equal to or even ahead of paying for groceries but it's crucial that others in the community have access to what I take for granted without making the same commitment. Van	I do not use libraries but they add to the community as a whole. Libraries provides books and internet access to those who cannot afford it. Libraries are crucial resources so that everyone have access to their resources.
7979843	Having worked in the public library sector in Australia for over 20 years, I am a strong advocate of life-long learning and equity in access to information, thus I support the Open Access movement. In May 2012 I started in a fixed-term contract position at a University Library, my first foray into academic librarianship. As such, the topic of digital libraries and institutional repositories is of personal interest to me. The Open Access movement and institutional repositories have openly challenged the traditional scholarly communication system, supporting a new model for scholarly communication. Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms. Institutional repositories (by their very nature) exert pressure on journal publishers to permit as much free online access to their content as economically possible. The library and information sector plays an important role in providing public access to networked information. Public libraries worldwide are a significant component; by ensuring that there is equity in access to information (for both educational and recreational purposes) through the provision of quality library services for all citizens.	We need to be able to access information and learn all our lives. Libraries are important because they allow everyone in the community to have access to knowledge. We need libraries because the significant role libraries play in the information arena and providing public access to networked information can't be overstated. Public libraries provide equal access to information for all citizens for both recreation and education.
7951527	Do we need libraries? I'm shocked that such a question is being asked at all. There has never been a time when the library is more relevant and in demand. Internet, digital books, multi-media com, culture, meeting point, making friends, quiet haven, working corner, coffee breaks, workshops, forums, seminars, newspaper and magazine reading, fiction collection, etc etc. In fact I would venture to suggest that the library should be open 24/7. A well-designed library should be the HUB of every city, no less.	The library is more relevant and in demand than ever. Libraries provide a venue for a number of desirable individual and shared life-enhancing activities. A proper library should be a focal point for it's community.
7950351	Look, there are issues to be debateed. Do we need as much brick and mortaror public shelf space as we have? I use libraries a lot. I download audible books frequently, but I don't use my local northern NY library system to do it, I use the NY City Library. If I do want a book I locate it on Amazon (since its presentation of the book: description, professional and reader reviews is much better than the libraries) then I order it (on-line) from my local library system. When I get the e-mail notice that the book is ready I finally pay a visit to my library to pick the book up. Using this process I wonder why my library has publicly displayed bookshelves at all.	Libraries now offer books online reducing the need for a brick and mortar style library. I can locate books and reviews easier online. With the internet, we really don't depend on the old system.
7955845	In our community, the most elegant, welcoming and practical buildings are our libraries. In the 9 years I have lived here, two libraries have been built and one redesigned and refurbished. Like the comments about the need for internet access among the poor, libraries ARE so much more. They have become a cultural, community hub for education, community activism, art, music, video and social interaction. One library has attracted the local gardening society to create and maintain a butterfly garden with many native plants that are marked for people to learn about them. Another group has offered to create a meandering walking path around the expanse of the building for reflection and a chance to walk in beauty outdoors. In many ways, I see our libraries becoming a sort of secular ministry -- feeding the souls as well as the minds of people. They are far from obsolete -- they are becoming more relevant and essential than ever before!	Libraries are elegant and nice buildings in my community. They provide internet access for the poor, as well as other things. Libraries provide a meeting places for many positive activities. I lot of reasons. Libraries are needed more than ever to feed the soul and minds of people.
7951790	If libraries were used for information only, those who are there for the computers benefit from the librarians, who know where to find appropriate info. But there is so much more at the library--music and book cds, dvd films, magazines and much more. I have used and owned computers for many years, but I value the library as much as much as ever.	Libraries have lots to offer in addition to books they provide music, dvd's, magazines and more.
6103587	The banks have been making enormous profits and paying out (again) obscene bonuses, seemingly forgetting that their purpose (as per Founding Fathers) is to serve the public not themselves. I could accept being nickel and dimed if the executive salaries were brought down to acceptable levels (i.e., maximum $500 000 for the CEO).	Banks are making big profits and forgetting to serve the public first.
6100112	If banks were doing what banks have traditionally done, i.e. provide credit for home purchases, small businesses, etc. they would not have to assess so many largely hidden fees. It seems since the financial collapse of 2008, banks are afraid to loan money. Even with interest rates as low as they are, providing consumers and the economy this essential service would provide them with the income they need to function.	The banks should provide credit for home purchasers, small businesses, and other entities. Interest rates are low and consumers should have basic services to help them.
6099502	Perhaps in the interests of balance this piece should mention that a checking account is the loss leader that any bank requires in order to get consumers to take out a credit card, savings account, buy CDs, take out a Mortgage, Car loan, etc. Not to mention that without consumers depending on the banks they wouldn't get bailout or cheap federal funds...	If citizens weren't forced to use banks for so many day to day things, banks couldn't depend on the government for a bailout or any funding.
6097752	In the early 90's I was studying Maths of Finance at university and fees and charges were just starting to raise their ugly heads. In hindsight Australia is about 20 years ahead of the US with regards to bank fees and charges and now the amount spent on User Paid fees and charges each year is equivalent to the total amount of profits declared by the Australian banks each year. I was curious and developed the Leveraged Depreciated User Paid Leasing system model at the time to calculate the consolidated impact of levying fees and charges per $1 unit on items that were already depreciable and leasable such as ATMs and PC's. It's not surprising that this simple but userous structure (with a 10%GST) can produce $1.36 in tax for the government and $2.56 in direct profits for the banks while the poor old user has to pay $6 for something that previously only cost the bank $1 in house and the government $1 from the public purse in depreciation, leaving the user and the bank with no net impost.	A bank user has to pay many times more for a service that costs the bank much less.
6102894	This problem didn't just arrive with recent regulation. Long ago banks started to look towards fining their customers as a way of making money. This was accompanied by deceptive practices used to maximize the amercable events ergo some of the regulations. Indeed hitting upon fines as a profit center coincided with discovering that gambling with the free money customers provided was more profitable than providing services to customers and the community - like making loans. We all know how that ended. Banks are a regulated industry (just like Wall Street) and the cost of doing business is offset by all that free customer's money and the banking monopoly (freedom from competition) created by the law regulating them. If retail banking is such an unsustainable business model, re-introduce the postal savings system or other government bank with expanded authority to make personal loans.	Bank fees ought to be regulated because banks are too eager to make money off their customers in the form of fees that function like fines. Banks are making more money with services than though offering basic services to the community. The cost of doing business for banks are offset by their customer's money and the banking monopoly.
6102433	Those banks have FREE USE OF OUR MONEY for weeks and months and years on end. Their business model is supposed to involve lending that money out at interest and generating profits that way. Fees? What do they need to charge fees for? Greedy bums!	Banks have free use of our money for weeks, months, and years. Banks generate profits by lending out money. Banks do not need more fees.
6100083	While it is true that Banks need to cover their costs and even make a profit the problem here is that Bank profits are once again substantial. When Banks show that they are loosing money on every retail customer (not just on offering checking accounts) I'll have some sympathy.	Banks' profits are too large. Banks don't lose money on retail customers.
6108212	Here's a funny episode: IRA account was closed February 2011; $12.86 interest was deposited after the balance was $0; February 2012 bank says deposit at least $1,000 or $30 fee will be charged starting April 30, 2012; requests to close essentially dead account have been circumvented with the most wordy, polite and obfuscating excuses; wondering how many years before account is actually closed.	I attempted to close an account in 2011 and in 2012 the bank stated they would charge a $30 if $1000 wasn't deposited, and the account is still open.
6104729	The way banks structure their fees for their services is absurd. The free account but profits made through hidden unrelated fees no one expects. It is like grocery stores that offered all their food for free to pull the most possible customers from competitors. But then they charge random cars in the parking lot $100 for parking more than 10 minutes. They charge a $10 surcharge on exit for every child that enters the store (with no signs posted about this on entrance). And an assortment of other fees that change as people catch on. And yet people keep coming for the free food. When the store wants to increase profits it comes up with more absurd fees.	The current fee structure banks impose for their services is absurd. Accounts should not be listed as free, when they include hidden fees.
6103657	Why shouldn't banks charge fees for accounts? It costs the bank money to open a branch, hire tellers to work at the branch, set up ATMs around town, produce debit or credit cards, print checks, and support the systems that transfer money electronically throughout the financial system.	It costs the bank money to operate.
6103526	How about this? My sister sent me a check for my birthday. I took it to her bank, and with my own i.d. tried to cash it. The teller said no problem ( I didn't have an account at her bank) but that there would be a $6 fee . So the $100 check cost me $6. Is this being ripped off? You bet it is.	Fees need to be regulated, I have tried to cash one of the banks own checks for which I was charged a fee for being a non-account holder banks are ripping off consumers.
6103367	This mess began more than 30 years ago when the government did away with the usury laws. Since then it's been open season on bank customers. With the rates imposed and fees added you'd think you were dealing with loan sharks. So far the only difference is that nobody drops by your house to break your knee caps if you overdraw your checking account, miss a payment, or move your money to a credit union. We need to reimpose caps above which no money lender or financial institution can impose fees, interest, or any other charges or fines.	The government getting rid of usury laws allowed banks to charge high fees. Fees and rates should be regulated because it is as if you were dealing with criminals.
6101724	Banks have to make their profits somewhere. Overdraft fees were very lucrative (if unsavory). The additional fees we're seeing now are a direct result of the decreased profitability around overdrafts. Consumers really didn't understand the extent to which overdraftees were propping up the free checking account for te rest of us. Also, some fees are designed to encourage unprofitable customers to walk out the door. And you guessed it. Small personal checking account customers who never purchase other products (e.g. mortgages), never generate overdrafts, etc. - we are the proverbial deadbeats. Big banks would love to see us walk to the credit unions. They will even hold the door open for us and wave goodbye.	Banks have to have a way to make profits. To regulate the result of decreased profitability around overdrafts. Overdraftees can affect the checking account system for everyone. Fees can make some people, who would not be desirable customers, choose to not use certain banks.
6099616	Unfortunately in this nation owned and led by the greediest, most unethical, and immoral executives America has, none of them care about the American people and wouldn't think twice about keeping a $5 fee instead of letting the baby have some milk. Its a sad, sad America today with no emotion left for the human condition, only a cold, heartless relentless pursuit of money. And for what? A new toy?	American executives are greedy and do not care about the American people. America is so concerned with money they have no sympathy for humans.
6099856	"The Center for Financial Services Innovation"...that says it all. Looking for innovative new ways to gouge consumers. I did financial services marketing and advertising for years. And I'm always amazed at the different marketing tactics banks use depending on their target audience. For example, I have a relatively high income, while my sister's is low. We both have mortgages with the same large bank. Both of us pay on time every month. But I'm offered special low refinancing rates with no closing costs via FedEx, and the bank sends someone to my home free of charge at my convenience to close, while my sister gets no offers and in fact they refuse to refinance her house at any rate. I can't even imagine the fabulous offers they make to the truly wealthy.	The Center for Financial Services Innovation provides an explanation for bank fees. Banks are constantly looking for innovative ways to pass fees on to consumers. High income customers are receiving more benefits than lower income customers who actually need help financing.
12633427	ISIS kills helpless minority "pagan" Yazidis and "deviant" Shias. It ethnically cleanse Christian minorities, it uses Yazidi women as sex slaves, it advocates genital mutilation of women, it kills innocent civilian hostages, it attracts starry eyed Muslim radicals from all over the world to join the new "Caliphate". It is a anti-civilization evil force that thrives in nihilism and wanton destruction. ISIS is Al Qaeda on steroids. Today it may not yet be an immediate danger to the US but it would be tomorrow once it consolidates its grip on the "liberated" region, its "Jihad" veterans would return home in the western countries like the UK, France etc and spread the mayhem there, it would plot from its "Caliphate" to repeat many more 9/11 until the "western world is brought under the Caliphate". It may or may not succeed in that ultimate goal but its methods would surely result in deaths and destruction all over the world including the west. Question is does the civilized world want to nip it in the bud now or let it fester like the Al Qaeda before it is too late to prevent major acts of terror?	The US should fight ISIS due to it's deplorable human rights abuses. ISIS is much worse than Al Qaeda. ISIS plans to repeat many more attacks in the future. ISIS needs to be stopped before it becomes an Al Qaeda so the US should work with Assad if it can stop that.
12629807	It is getting very tiresome hearing "experts" such as Abrahms repeat the lie that Assad never harmed Americans. During the American occupation of Iraq, Assad sent thousands of Jihadis to kill US soldiers and Iraqi civilians. These Jihadis were responsible for the worst atrocities of the Iraq war. Only last year, Assad's chief Mufti threatened Europe with "suicide bombers". His father Hafez was responsible for the killing of 241 US marines in a suicide attack on their barracks in Lebanon. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" is, apparently, what passes for analysis on the Middle East these days. It is a platitude by which not a single government in the Middle East has ever been known to set its policies by.	Assad sent Jihadis to kill Americans and those Jihadis did some of the most despicable things during the war. Assad and his father have been responsible with threatening Europe with suicide bombers and killing 241 US marines in Lebanon. The US and Assad have a common enemy.
12644539	This is where I really like Israel. B/c they act on intel. with airstrikes, maybe they tell us, but it always hits the news. They've gone into Syria multiple times bombed a moving target and came back home. They ACT. Why us, why now, why not the EU or NATO, or the Arab League??? No, Assad is done. He's vicious and deplorable. Appeal to the UN to give Israel the territory they already control, the Golan Heights. Appeal to the UN and possibly act with others, see above, to formally give the Kurds the State they already have control over; something the Europeans forgot about in the early 20th Century. Aid the Israelis and the Kurds, not Assad.	No, Assad is done. He's vicious and deplorable. Aid the Israelis and the Kurds, not Assad.
12631449	Assad is a dictator... but, this is what that part of the world needs. Iraq fell apart after we removed Saddam Husein...and as a result, the Sunni insurgency began, Al Quaeda reincarnated and ISIS was born ... all in Saddam's absence. Our war in Iraq was a mistake, our war in Libya was a mistake... we must not repeat those same mistakes in Syria. Tyrants like Assad are what keeps the extremists under control. The culture of the middle east needs those dictators that keep the extremists in check... removing those dictators will open the flood gates of Islamic extremists that could threaten the world as ISIS is doing now. We need to work with Assad, with Iran and with all those countries and groups who have been fighting ISIS.	The US should not fight anyone in Syria, as our past wars in Irag and Libya have lead to mistakes. Tyrants are what keep extremists going. Without the dictators of the Middle east keeping extremist in check there would be more ISIS like extremest threatening the world. The US should work with all of the countries that are fighting ISIS.
12631097	The US has dealt with unsavory characters before. An approach to Assad offering to stabilize Eastern Syria by defanging ISIS could be used as leverage for progress elsewhere. The perfect is the enemy of the good, especially in the Middle East.	The US has worked with people who weren't entirely aboveboard before. Helping Assad now could be used as leverage elsewhere.
12630834	Just over 70 years ago we allied with Josef Stalin to defeat Nazi Germany. stalin's Soviet Union was at least as bad as the Assad regime is now. ISIS might not yet be the existential threat posed by the Axis powers but it is heading that way. Point being that we should do whatever is necessary short of WMD to defeat this evil. Even if it means cooperating with Assad whose regime, while brutal, poses no threat to the US.	We were allied with Stalin to fight the Nazis; Assad is as bad as Stalin. ISIS is headed toward the level of danger of the Axis powers and needs to be defeated. Assad's regime poses no threat to the US.
12630025	The old Cold War methods of containment and deterrence will work with ISIS, as they did with the former Soviet Union. There is no need to pour more American money into this, other than, perhaps, to defend an independent Kurdistan. If ISIS reaches the Saudi borders, it can stop there. Let the Sunnis have their state.	Cold War methods like containment and deterrence will work with Isis. The only reason for American spending would be defending Kurdistan.
12629482	We helped create ISIS in Iraq simply by occupying the country and bringing down the strongman that would not let them. We then exploited ISIS in Syria to fight against Assad. At first they fought side by side with the al-Nusra Front (Ayman Zawahiri's men) and both groups blended with the Syrian opposition. That was fine with us as long as they did what we wanted. But ISIS had their own agenda all along, and it excluded al-Nusra and the dumb rebels. Help Assad, who was telling the truth since the start, stay in power, and let Russia and Iran support him then ISIS will be wiped out. That is of course if we are done playing games.	The US is responsible for the creation and uprise of ISIS and the fact that they are in Syria because the US used them as a weapon against Assad. Helping Assad, with assistance from Iran and Russia, will help defeat ISIS.
12628825	Just because ISIL currently has the support of the local Sunni populace, does not mean this will last. Let the Sunnis that have allied with ISIL get to know them a bit better, and I am sure resistance will form eventually. The focus should be on supporting the Kurds only, like President Obama is doing right now. In these situations, patience is of the utmost importance. Let us see where the pieces fall first. There is no need to rush into anything. The current air support of the Kurdish Forces and supplying only them with sophisticated weaponry should be the strategy, nothing more and nothing less.	ISIL having the support of the Sunni populace may not be permanent. There will be eventual resistance to ISIS. The U.S. should support the Kurds only. We should not rush into anything. Give the Kurdish Forces weapons and strategy as well as air support, but no more.
12628676	Assad, Iran, Sadr's Army,etc.etc., We are in a quagmire of our own making- the region has been severely destabilized since our invasion of Iraq. Why did we not then leave well enough alone as no real threat was posed to our security...Isis does not yet pose a threats to any American except those rash enough to be involvers in fighting in Iraq and Syria. Why not not follow the morally correct policy of non-intervention....here in may come to the often discussed but rarely published adage "Let them kill each other off" which poses no dangers for us. In the long run, the strongest party (ies) will probably prevail regardless of what America does, so what is the gain in posturing that our national security is at issue and we need to intervene...especially when we can't even figure out whose side we should be intervening on!	Isis does not pose a threat to most Americans. The stronger of ISIS and Assad will be on top in the end so why prevent we need to get involved when we don't even know who's side to be on?.
12631076	"Assad has been key to its [ISIS] rise in Syria and beyond." I beg to differ. Saudi Arabia and Qatar, at the behest of the US State Department and encouraged by neocon PNacers, have been key to the rise of ISIS. When Mr Hassan introduces as a fact a proposition that is not factual, I feel free to discount his opinion.	Assad has helped ISIS rise.
12629542	It's nice to think that we can just disengage from the Middle East, but ISIS hate us. If we give them an inch, they'll take a mile and then it'll be a breeding ground for terrorists over there just like Afghanistan was. We have to go after radical Islamists when we have the opportunity.	The U.S. should work with Assad to defeat ISIS. Working with Assad will help defeat radical islamists.
15164648	The average woman on Planet Earth is not a white European North American. Women in Africa, Indo-Pacific, Asia, Central and South America are being very fertile and fruitful. With a billion humans lacking access to clean fresh drinking water, another billion persons not having sanitary sewage waste disposal and 800 million persons starving or malnourished there are more of us than ever before and we are living longer than ever. Infectious diseases still work to limit population growth. As animal predation and killing on and of humans fades, war has become less deadly in absolute and relative numbers.	There are more humans now more than ever.
15164217	Pearce wants to fix the overpopulation problem by, " low-carbon energy, recycling of everything from metals to water and fixing the massive inefficiencies in food production." This will not solve the problem, only temporarily and then exacerbate it. There is only so much hay in the pasture folks, you can stretch that hay out any way you like, but in the end, we must control human growth rates. When we have food, we will reproduce and that creates a host of other issues in the long run.	Many important resources, such as water, food, and even metals, are jeopardized by a crisis of overpopulation. There are limited resources available, and we must make sure that population doesn't outproduce the resources we have. Having food makes us tend to reproduce creating more problems.
15163963	The world already has too many people. One only has to pick up the newspaper to read of thousands of people risking their necks to move to countries who do not want them in order to better their standard of living. A good example of overpopulation is Haiti. Haitian have too many babies. Their people try to migrate to other countries who spend resources to find such immigrants and deport them.	There is a large population of people moving out of overcrowded places. Haiti is overpopulated. Overcrowding is a problem, particularly in Haiti, their migration causes other countries resources to be wasted.
15163752	1. Bangladesh / Rohinga --population unsustainable = boat people. 2. Middle East- desert cannot feed the excess children = genocidal wars to reduce population. 3. WW1 & WW2 - Europe could not provide enough jobs for its blossoming population = 100 million killed. 4. Mao's grreat leap forward ? 100 million slaughtered = one child policy -> working 5. Catholics overbreeding Protestants = Northern Ireland's' troubles'. 6. Palestinian Arabs deliberate demographic overbreeding = continued war with Israel. 7. Young Muslim males without brides = rape ,torture,conquest Boko Harem, ISIS. ....solution BIRTH CONTROL or war -take your pick.	Children go hungry in the deserts finite resources and causes wars between tribes. Overpopulation results in armed conflict if uncontrolled.
15167053	All six commentators make valid points. But I'm struck by the fact that none of them discuss the injustice of human beings monopolizing so large a percentage of Earth's habitat and resources, or the resulting ongoing mass extinction of Earth's species. If a particular nation or people were aggressively displacing other nations and peoples, overrunning their land and taking their resources, leaving these others displaced, diminished, even completely exterminated, the world would have no problem calling this behavior by its proper name: genocidal warfare. The modern endless growth economy--dedicated to making ever more people ever wealthier--is interspecies genocide. Its time we ended our war on nature and accepted limits to human numbers and human economic demands.	Often people overlook the fact that humans take up a lot of the Earth's habitat and resources, when discussing the mass extinction of species. Capitalism causes overcrowding to be problematic.
15165585	Wrong! Two reasons. One, Malthusianism does not hold, since resource production can go up exponentially too. Two, the population will peak out at 12-15 billion or so, when it will start to shrink, as it has been doing in Europe for decades now. Uncontrolled extrapolation is a trap to avoid.	Resource production can increase exponentially to match population growth. Population will peak and decrease just like in Europe.
15164914	Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking. One doesn't hear "god will take care of us" or "we have always found new sources of oil before" as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products. This limiting factor also means of course that all national states will approach zero-growth, steady state economies.

15164629	Malthusian [mal-thoo-zhuh n, -zee-uh n] Word Origin adjective "Malthusian. Definition: of or relating to the theories of T. R. Malthus, which state that population tends to increase faster, at a geometrical ratio, than the means of subsistence, which increases at an arithmetical ratio, and that this will result in an inadequate supply of the goods supporting life unless war, famine, or disease reduces the population or the increase of population is checked.. . ." Todays Malthusian scholars somehow seem not to be aware that their theories of "overcrowding" were advanced 200 or so years ago by Tom Malthus--and haven't been validated in experience. It matters not that today's scholars cite overproduction of CO2 due to increases in population as the source of the problem, rather than inability to produce a supply of goods adequate to support life.	Overcrowding theories have never been vaildated. Overproduction of CO2 doesn't matter when there is not enough supplies for all the people on the planet.

15170116	Laurie Mazur talks of women's rights being the key to population, a mantra embedded in the Rio Declaration of 1992. But this approach, which came to dominate the population field, has not lead to a significant reduction in fertility in many of the most overpopulated countries. Unfortunately, the well meaning leaders of the women's reproductive rights movement have not yet confronted the rights of the future generations of this planet that resources will not, and already cannot sustain. Are they to be doomed to a grim life of chaotic climate, food and water shortages and no jobs? What is clear is that the world is not sustaining the thousands of refugees drowning in the Andaman Sea and Mediterranean Ocean escaping an unsustainable existence.	Though it was speculated that women gaining equal rights would lead to population control, this has not proven true in some of the most overpopulated countries. The pro-life movement does not consider overcrowding and population growth in it's ideology. If the world was sustaining itself thousands of refugees would not be dying trying to find a place to live.
15164771	There is another way that our population growth will be our undoing: There are not enough meaningful jobs on the planet for the number of people who are already on it. With our efficiencies in production, and the limits to natural resources, this problem will get worse over time. We do have a population problem, a serious one, but it is more than just numbers and how to feed them. We can make it so large numbers of people do not die, but that doesn't mean this planet can be manipulated so that those same large number of people can truly live.	Overcrowding is a threat because there are not enough meaningful jobs for everyone. The issue will get worse as time goes on because we aren't efficient with our natural resources. We can find ways to keep more people alive, but not necessarily with a great quality of life.
15164429	Yes, America needs to get its house in order. Our population is growing by about 30 million per decade!!! Just about all of the population growth results from immigration. So let's reduce immigration and also focus on reducing consumption. Without reduced immigration all our environmental efforts to be more efficient and consume less are swamped and irrelevant.	Populations grow every decade.
18552535	If media outlets would be fair and objective and report the news, there would be no need to to Facebook and see what others are talking about. Facebook is a democratization of the news in the sense that you can find stories and opinions that the corporate media are too afraid or intimidated or just plain arrogantly refusing to cover. Bernie Sanders is just one example NYT. Please wake up and do the right thing before you become irrelevant.	Media outlets need to learn to be more fair in their reporting. Facebook shows a wide variety of news, that corporate news sources might not show.
18556963	What has been uncovered so far is that there are faceless, nameless people posing as real journalist deciding what stories are important and not important with ZERO oversight from an editorial board or any peer review. Facebook should be taken for what it really is ----- Just a BLOG in the Blogosphere of the Internet. Facebook is only useful for sharing photos of your children or dogs and cats.	There are anonymous people posing as real journalists with no oversight or peer review. Facebook is simply a blog on the internet.
9950813	Right on! The watchword for any business, restaurants included, should generally be "the customer is always right." This is especially true with regard to tastes, and appreciation of flavors. People do not all experience the same food the same way and for an egotistic chef to imagine he has the right to determine how much salt should be put on something is ridiculous. The chef doesn't know best for everyone. So keep the salt and pepper shakers. They are the ubiquitous best flavor enhancers around--the very reason they are ubiquitous in any GOOD restaurant IMHO!	Restaurants should not impose their will on customers and allow customers to salt food to their own tastes. People experience food differently and an chef should not have the right to determine how much salt to put on something. Chef doesn't know best for everyone. Salt is one of the best ways to enhance flavor.
9997389	I learned to salt in culinary school. If the cooks and the chef are SURE of the flavor level of every dish, then keep the salt off the table. But not every food preparer is perfect. It is presumptive of the chef to think his food is perfectly flavored for every portion of the dish and for the entire meal. I think it is more an ego trip, than assisting the diner.	Not every person who prepares food is perfect. The chef cannot presume to know the salt preferences of their diners.
9984851	I don't like the idea that a chef or restaurant owner would make that decision for me, but I have to say that I almost never need to add salt at a restaurant. The food is usually very well seasoned.	Chefs or restaurant owners should not make "salt" for cstomers.
9953248	Does not bother me as I have left salt out of my diet for over 40 years. I keep salt on the table for my husband nor do I salt food. If anyone wants to add it to their food they are more than welcome	Anyone is more than welcome to add wanted salt to their food.
9952970	For me, it's pretty simple, whenever I go to a restaurant, and don't see salt, pepper, or condiments, I can rest easy knowing that a real, honest to goodness artisan is staffed in the kitchen. I know my food will come out tasting just fine.	If I don't see salt, pepper, and condiments on the table, I know that an artisan is working in the kitchen.
9950746	I never add salt to my food at the table -- because I prefer my food to be very lightly salted. It has been my experience that every restaurant I have dined at that has stopped putting salt shakers on the table completely OVERSALTS the food . I no longer eat at any of those places.	I don't add salt at the table.
9950396	I am amazed that these chef's think that they might possibly know how each diner likes his or her food seasoned. I find most food at restaurants too salty. My husband is the opposite and almost always adds salt. Salty of the food varies a lot between regions of the country. Chef's should not take away the customers control of this small item. I wish they would salt less in the kitchen.	The chef can't know how each person wants their food seasoned. Tastes vary by region. Consumers should be able to make their own decision about salt.
9950119	Frankly, it is arrogant for a chef/restaurant to assume that their food does not need additional seasoning. People have different preferences when it comes to a desire for more salt in their meal. Let the customers choose, and offer salt at the table. I am irked whenever I have to ask for it. Chefs are in the hospitality business, so be hospitable!	The eater might want more salt and the chef is arrogant to ignore this fact. Each person is unique and has their own specific tastes, it should be their personal decision. Chefs should cater to their diners' preferences.
9948874	Most restaurant food is already too salty. I'd rather they salted their food LESS and let us control our salt at the table. I don't use table salt, myself. I lightly season my food and then if others want more salt they can have it. Salt should be treated as an adjunct. Food should be seasoned with spices. The salt is there to increase those flavors, not to be a flavor in and of itself. At least that's how it worked in my restaurant, and that's what I do at home now that I'm retired.	The chef should put less salt on the food and let the patron ad more if needed.
9948546	Oversalting in the kitchen is the best way to kill a dish. Some chefs have a salty pallate. Tastes good to them but tastes like a salt bomb to others. There are plenty of chefs that fall into this category. Those chefs will continue cooking even after they see dishes getting sent back to the kitchen. If there's a salt shaker at the table they know they can add less salt than they would prefer and let the diner adjust the salt at the table. May the salt shaker remain.	Chefs and consumers have different tastes. Chefs should slightly undersalt food and allow the consumer to decide the proper salt level for their tastes.
9947339	I am not a big user of salt, but I like having it available in the event the meal needs it. I don't know why people get upset when people salt before tasting when the restaurants insist on grinding pepper into your food before you have tasted it.	Salt should be available to those who want to use it.
9947157	I have a salt sensitivity and have not been able to eat some foods at prepared by the chef. I use just the right amount of salt at home to season dishes. It's a necessary seasoning in most dishes, it just doesn't need to be used in excess. Guess my message is: put those salt shakers on the table for those who enjoy extra salt on their dishes. Please don't have a heavy hand in the kitchen....I'd like to be able to enjoy what I order.	It is important seasoning and can be used in moderation. People who want extra salt should be able to enjoy it.
9944892	I find most restaurant food too salty. I know this not so much from the taste but the way my body reacts afterwards. I often wake up in the middle of the night with extreme dry mouth after eating out. Since there are some people who should have little to no salt in their diets for health reasons, I'd prefer to see chefs go very lightly with the salt and then let people add salt if they wish.	Because some people are on salt restricted diets, it would be best to offer salt at the table for discretionary use and for the chef to salt very sparingly in cooking.
9944889	I live in Las Vegas where there are plenty of really good restaurants. if i am paying good money for a meal I should be able to season the food with salt and pepper as i see fit. Why should some chef dictate to me what I can and cannot do with my food. There are plenty of famous name restaurants here in Vegas that have salt and pepper shakers on the table.	I should be able to season my food as I wish.
9944695	No two people have the same sense of taste nor does any one person have a consistent sense of taste given variables such as response to environmental allergies and recovery from colds. To say that salt is not offered at the table is Bloomberg Nannyish at minimum and downright control freakish. I long ago sought to reduce the salt in my diet and my taste has adjusted over time, but I have not eliminated salt nor do I intend to. Most baked or roasted poultry dishes are horrible without some added salt and there are other foods that cry out for it- popcorn is a good example. Having worked in healthcare for 27 years I have no illusions about the harm that a high sodium diet can have on some people. However, it is also possible to wisely reduce salt intake and still enjoy it in some foods. As the taste is highly subjective and individual I cannot agree with Mr Sbragg.	Everyone has different tastes. Many foods, like poultry or popcorn, require salt for optimal taste.
9953448	Biology plays a role in an individual's perception of how salty something tastes. If a chef insists on making the decision of how to properly salt a dish, then some will perceive it as over salted and some as under salted. It's a lot easier to add more salt than to remove salt from food. I always prefer a restaurant to go easy on the salt, and allow me to add what I feel is necessary for my tastes. Otherwise a number of diners are forced into eating food that they might enjoy more, if allowed to have input on how it's salted.	Some people will not agree with the chefs level of saltiness. Customers can add but cannot remove salt to taste. Salt should be decided by the consumer.
9953236	I disagree. For some of us, such as runners who go out in the sweltering heat for a long distance run in the desert, replenishing the salt and electrolytes lost during the run is a matter of health and recovery, not merely a flavoring option. I can understand that sedentary people and some chefs might blanch when the see me salting my food at a restaurant. But I'd like them to realize that I am doing so almost as a medicinal application and would prefer they reserve judgment until they've run a dozen miles in my shoes.	Salt is useful for replacing electrolytes lost through exercise. My salt intake is medicinal and catered to my individual needs.
9952772	The chef's vision, blah, blah, blah. Every so often at at otherwise decent restaurant, the chef of the moment under salts the food. Just plain and simple, they miss the mark. I understand, that happens, the food doesn't turn up on the table just as the chef intended when the dish was created. I am talking about a case in which the executive chef, were she tasting the food herself, would consider it under seasoned. In such a case when I am spending $38 on an entree, would the restaurant prefer I send it back and refuse to pay, or eat it and grumble about it on Yelp, or simply shake a little salt on it and be happy and tip well? It is the restaurant's choice. In addition, salt is not cinnamon. It is an absurd comparison. An under salted dish is unpalatable. A dish with less than optimal cinnamon is still fine.	Sometimes a chef doesn't put enough salt on the food. It is better to be able to season your own food and be satisfied than send the entree back or complain about it on Yelp. Salt makes food taste better.
9952264	Salt, pepper, condiments are as much a part of the dinner table as the flatware or chopsticks. I love to sprinkle fresh herbs on my food, including pepper, parsley, cilantro, and dishes of chutney and relishes are a staple part of many other cuisines. Relying on the chef to match my taste is like relying on the sound man at a rock concert to keep the music at a bearable level. The chef is often as deaf as the sound man. Pass the ketchup.	Salt should be considered as common as place settings at the table. Everyone has their own tastes when it comes to salt.
9947795	I may be going against the grain here, but although I agree that it is the customer's right to add salt, it is generally no longer an integral part of the cooked dish. It is usually just salty. I also find it insulting. I should no more expect someone to add salt to one of my dishes as I would expect that person to add brush strokes to one of my paintings. (Go ahead; I have been called worse.)	Customer's have the right to add salt, but it is no longer part of the cooked dish. Salt is too salty. Adding salt to something I prepared would be insulting my hard work salt has no place at the table.
9944713	In fact, the research on this point is now more in favor of salt than against it. And for people not near the coast, the iodine in salt is necessary to prevent goiter. I go to a lot of restaurants these day where there's hot sauce on the tables and people douse their food with so much that I wonder how they can taste anything. That's their choice; if salt is mine, then supply the salt. Restaurants are supposed to be about cooks serving the customers, not about those who are paying bowing to the 'vision' of the 'chef.'	Research suggests salt is better for you than once thought. Iodine in salt is necessary. Diners should be allowed to judge their own salt needs. Restaurants serve people, therefore they should provide things that make the customer happy, not force them into what the chef thinks is best.
9944277	I disagree with the first paragraph. When I pay someone to make me a meal, I am entitled to season it however I wish. The notion that I should defer to the chef's seasoning choices exclusively is pretentious and silly. I have paid very good money for very bland and uninspired food. I shall make use of salt and pepper as I wish to salvage such experiences.	There's no guarantee a restaurant meal will be seasoned to my taste, so the fact I'm paying for the product means I determine what will be done to it in terms of salt.
9952573	I do not care how many lives would or would not be saved in this salty debate. I don't like the taste of salt. Too many chefs use it because they are too lazy to combine herbs, other spices, or caramelize the food, etc. Please, chefs, use less salt and put the shakers on the table - a win/win for salt lovers and haters.	Salt shakers permit diners to control the amount of salt in their food.
9952065	So much restaurant food is, according to my taste, way too salty. For this reason I'd much rather have the food be undersalted and have salt shakers at the table where I can add just enough salt to taste, but no more. It's so easy to add salt, but it's such a chore picking out all those little salt molecules from my food.	It is better to be able to salt one's food according to personal taste, rather than having the restaurant over salt it. You can easily add salt to food, but you can't take it out.
9952050	My parents put salt, pepper and sugar on sliced tomatoes. I suspect their parents did too. I did it until I learned better after tasting it without the sugar. Still put salt and lots of pepper. As long as he lived (90 years) my dad salted his food before tasting it. I can just imagine his reaction to a restaurant that did not have salt on the table. I use less salt than I used to, but I still want to be the one to decide how much I use.	Salt belongs on the table. Salt should be available because you can self moderate. I should be able to decide how much salt I use.
9949264	Nice post. I have a similar situation with one of the people I cook for. He has high blood pressure and is on a salt-restricted diet, but doesn't follow it very well. He always adds salt to my dishes, but no one else does. I think we all have different tolerances for salt and different palates. Everyone needs to be able to make their own decisions. I'm also with you on sugar. Even before I got early type 2 diabetes, I was reducing the sugar in recipes because they tasted too sweet to me. The amount of sugar overwhelmed the other flavors. But that's another topic for another day. :)	I believe salt preference is personal taste and you should be able to decide for yourself.
5611762	All very true but I feel a lot of people have lost the ability to be an "informed skeptic" i.e. know when something doesn't seem plausible and be willing to do the work to investigate further. Just look at the controversy over established science for example. It seems to me that lots of folks search out information that conforms to their own viewpoint and accept that, regardless of evidence to the contrary. "I saw it on the internet, it must be right!"	People need to be willing and know when to investigate things that are implausible. For example, controversy over established science. People seek information to reinforce their preexisting beliefs and are willing to believe anything they read, regardless of evidence.
5611072	Once standards in culture, entertainment and politics are debased, it's much easer for media conglomerates to take advantage of this to rake in more profits. People don't know any better, so they don't have the standards any more to judge quality. The entertainment or media product can be easily assembled without real talent. This goes for our politics too, where the most outrageous platforms are offered to voters, in the expectation that these garbage proposals will get a candidate elected. What are being elected are junk candidates, but many voters don't realize it. They have often voted against their own interests, as has been widely noted. Once junk seems normalized, it's not called junk anymore.	People don't know any wiser and don't have standards to judge quality. Media and entertainment are not created with enough thought and intention. Even in the political arena it has become clear that people are being offered the most oulandish options for people to simply get the election. People are voting against their own interests.
5615588	I don't think we're getting dumber, I just think many people today are not as enthusiastic about learning as earlier generations were. I work for an insurance company, and I am constantly taking continuing education courses. I often hear my peers make comments such as, "I don't care what kind of score I get as long as I pass." When I hear comments like that, I often think to myself, why would someone want to settle for "passing"? Why not aim higher? Unfortunately, for many people, "good" is good enough for them.	People are just less enthusiastic about learning than before.
5613711	As a prof for 34 years, people ask me whether students are getting dumber or smarter. That would be very hard to quantify even with the most sophisticated measurement instruments. Empirically (that means observations done more or less scientifically) I see that there are still those that have it (intelligence, critical reasoning, a thirst for readiing, cognitive complexity) and those who don't (or just don't care). Additionally, most of us profs notice that there is a huge gap between those haves and have nots and that there is a huge gulf of mediocrity in our young people and citizenry. Unless you count ability to distinguish between Manolo and Jimmy Choo shoes, we are definitely becoming dumber. But remember, most of our empiricism is done at the local tavern.	People are not using their intelligence to the best of his or her ability anymore. Professors notice that there is a huge gulf of mediocrity in our young people. People are dumber unless it concerns material goods.
5612412	Simply watch the GOP debates, anti-intellectualism abounds. Now Rick Santorum claims a formal education indicates snobery and wants to abolish the Dept. of Ed., Head Start, The Pell Grant program, etc. Oddly, the Republican voting base is considering it. many are so dumbed down, they easily vote against their own best interest. Why don't GOP women protest and demand to be on the all male panel discussing female reproductive rights. The dumbing down of America.	If you just watch the GOP debates you will be assured that people are getting dumber. Not being intellectual abounds. Formal education indicates snobery. People vote against their best interests. Women are not trying to have a say in their rights.
5613090	Political correctness, loweracceptance standards to ensure minority hiring, lowered standards for teachers and students, inability to read at one's chronological age, having to teach to the lowest achiever in the class, and a gov't that pays people when they can't get (or won't) jobs, all lead us down the path of ignorance. For many people, there is no incentive to learn anything other than what they have to.	Having lower acceptance standards is causing people to be more accepting of ignorance. Without incentive, they don't want to learn anything other than what they have to.
5612701	Yes, I do believe we are devolving to some degree. Advancements in medical technologies have negated Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest allowing more than a few people who may have perished due to their own stupidity to not only survive but reproduce.	Survival of the fittest no longer applies because of advancements in medical technologies, and the stupid not only survive.
5612280	My personal experience is that people are getting dumber. In the last few years, i have actually had office personnel who literally could not file- did not seem to understand the alphabet. This was unheard of twenty years ago- at least with the alleged degree of education some of these people have. During this recession, which to me does not seem to be over, i have been astounded at the many people hired who do not understand that if i want them to do a certain job, they had better perform it or they won't have a job! They are actually shocked when fired, even when given several verbal and written warnings. And of course i see typos every day in the print media, and not just low quality media either, although i suppose it is due to lack of editors or an over-reliance on spell-checker. i am getting more forgetful because of age but i still seem to have a better grasp of general things then the kids half my age. Maybe their brains are disturbed by all the things they are exposed to at much too young an age- like television or texting.	People these days do not know the alphabet. In highly respected publications there are numerous errors. Television and texting are disturbing brains at a young age.
5612224	In our society, people have to be told that their coffee is very hot, or to remove the plastic wrap of something before eating. I can't imagine people having to be informed about this years ago. IQ tests college degrees do not mean anything if he/she wants to put their finger in an electrical socket to find out if it works. I would say people are more educated than a generation ago, but there is a huge lack of common sense today which unfortunately you can not teach. Other than protecting people from themselves by putting them in bubble wrap, I don't see a fix for that.	People today lack common sense that cannot be taught.
5611379	Actually, TV is getting much smarter (better), reflecting quality of life and hope, which for those not at the top is getting worse....Technological addictions and economic distractions make it practically impossible for the vast majority of people to think, analyze, and grow. The ones who can are better off than most of their ancestors, but they are in the smallest of minorities.	Technology and the economy have caused people to be less able to think for themselves.
5615055	We are certainly less informed and are less motivated to be informed. Too much access to entertainment, which is easier to watch than picking up a newspaper or reading a book. Basically, people in this country are increasingly more intellectually lazy than they are stupid.	We are less informed and aren't motivated to be informed. Access to entertainment is easier than access to information. People in the US are becoming more intellectually lazy than stupid.
5612405	Its like our youth live in a fog of youtube, Facebook friends, Netflix and Hulu PLus, constantly needing to be entertained by music, comedy, TV shows, movies, non stop entertainment designed to get you hooked and stay zombie like. Its a hard reality, not pleasant. Because the rest of the world is racing by and ahead, while we drown ourselves in pointless entertainment.	Our youth is too involved with digital entertainment and they are constantly in a fog. People tend to watch pointless entertainment.
5614959	All the backward thinking that Dr. Pinker mentions as a thing of the past actually reflects many of the conservative views currently held by our most prominent Republican politicians, as well as their constituents. Apparently higher education is even under attack now, so as much as I'd like to share Dr. Pinker's optimistic views, I can't disagree more.	The backwards thinking mentioned by Dr. Pinker as a thing of the past reflect conservative views by Republican's and their constituents.
5613636	I have taught at elite universities for the past 43 years. Before that, I served three years as an enlisted man in the United States Army and taught arithmetic to students in surveying students at the engineer school at Ft. Belvior. From this limited experience, I can make two observations. Students at elite universities have grown stronger in the last four decades and the state of American secondary education in 1964 was awful. Enlisted men who had had be selected to learn surveying had mathematic skills that were so weak we did not try to teach lowest common denominator when we covered fractions. I don't think we are getting dumber and we still have a system that can discover talent in students from less privileged backgrounds. The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator McCarthy and his list of communists in the State Department, the hysteria leading to the Spanish-American War, the American Civil War and a very long list of disturbing events in Europe from the Holocaust to the Crusades. Be cheerful. It has always been this good or this bad.	Students are stronger than forty years ago at Elite universities, and all students are better than in 1964. We have a system that finds less-privileged students with talent. This is the level of intelligence people have always had.
5611741	I think our abilities in the fields of rational thought and logic are being usurped by technology. As another debater said; we find it difficult to read a map or measure a room for carpeting. However these everyday functions are made easier with the development of GPS and laser measuring readers. And the examples in this category are many. Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it. With today's computerized control systems, that's impossible. So are we getting dumber? Some are and some aren't. I only hope I'm part of the latter. What I do know is that I cannot function without the occasional assistance from my Apple Dictionary.	Computers are replacing humans ability to think. People are dumber now because 50 years ago people could usually repair their own car. I need my Apple Dictionary occasionally.
18638610	Allowing foreign airlines to serve domestic routes is definitely something that doesn't get brought up enough. It's funny how the domestic carriers are all for deregulation and increased competition in theory, but once outside foreign airlines are involved, they rely on what you rightfully point out is antiquated regulation. Fact is that Americans really only have a choice between four airlines for domestic travel and are subject to the whims of these companies. The airline industry is a monopolistic entity and should be treated as such. This means to be required to cooperate with certain regulations.	We should bring up foreign airlines serving domestic routes more often. There is little choice between airlines, so their rules can not be escaped. It should be regulated as any monopolistic entity. Airlines would be required to cooperate with newly imposed government regulations.
18641085	Personally I think airlines don't care about any of their workers. They most certainly don't care about the flying public/customer. This is reflected in the faces of all who are shoehorned and buckled into tiny seats. Like all other jobs today we humans are disposable workers, flight attendants included. I can handle a surly or neglectful attendant on occasion for it is a tough, demanding position but we can't let the airlines cut corners on their pilots. This worries me tremendously having worked for the airlines in the past. These mostly highly trained professionals are being abused and not paid decently. Don't get me wrong cabin crews are important but the person in the cockpit can not be marginalized or treated poorly. I think we can all agree that safe, happy and well rested and trained pilots are crucial to the business.	Airlines don't care about any of their workers. Airlines don't care about the flying public/customer. Reflected in the faces of all who are shoehorned, and buckled into tiny seats. The government could help airline wages.
18643837	If I'm flying from coast to coast (5 hours) for $500 cheaper than in the 1970s, the airline is essentially paying me $100 an hour to sit in slightly cramped conditions eating my own sandwich. That's worth it! So I'll have a luxurious meal when I touch down, and still have $430 left over to spend on myself.	If deregulation reduces flight cost I am more than willing to be uncomfortable.
18642435	This part, "The worst part of the travel experience today is the part that's the most heavily regulated; in fact, it's run by the government itself. The security experience is awful.." seems to forget that private security failed most catastrophically on 9/11. Disgraceful.	The worst part of the travel experience is government regulated.
18639835	So the only other option than the status quo is 1979? I don't buy it. I was on an airline yesterday, there was no room for my 6'3" frame and my client won't cover 1st class. There needs to be minimum seating standards, and there needs to be a trigger to require the airlines to waive baggage fees if TSA lines are longer than 45 minutes. The airlines were quick with their hands out after 9/11, they won't lift a hand now that they are fat and happy. Some regulation sounds good to me. It doesn't mean Communism, it means common sense.	Government should regulate airlines because I do not fit into the seats they provide. There should be seating standards, and baggage fees should be waived for those in TSA line over 45 minutes. Government should regulate airlines because they only take and do not give back to consumers.
18683641	Anyone who says or even thinks that air travel today is superior in any meaningful way to air travel before regulation has no direct knowledge of regulated air travel. - I do. Air travel today is equivalent to bus travel in the sixties. I remember that as well. There is no such thing as a free market in any industry -- least of all the airline industry.	Air travel today has low standards. Airlines are not a free market industry.
18646939	On my flight yesterday from Seattle to Dulles/DC the legroom upgrade would have been $119, not $39. Where I live, Southwest doesn't fly, so that isn't happening. Because flying has become so unpleasant I do it as little as possible. The only bright spot is the foreign carriers on trans Atlantic flights--a trip to Milan via Emirates last summer was a pleasure, with legroom, edible food and a choice of 500 movies to watch for free. Regulation of things like legroom and full disclosure of fees sounds like a good idea to me.	Government should regulate airlines because it has become so awful I avoid it. Airlines should have regulated fees and seating.
18645683	Free market forces work well when there is a direct and obvious connection between the purchase and the consumption of goods and services. Not so well, when the provider of the goods and services is able to hide price behind layers of obfuscation and indirection. The airlines, very much like health care insurers and providers, make it almost impossible to know up front what you are buying and what it will cost. Just like health care insurers and providers, the purchaser of air transportation is often a business with a different set of priorities from those of the ultimate consumer --- we the people. Under those circumstances, only intelligent and knowledgeable regulation can work.	The free market system we use works at its best when there is a straight connection between purchases and the consumption. The provider of services hides behind high prices and misdirection. Airlines have become just as greedy as health care insurers and providers. Government should regulate because airline priorities do not include the consumer. The way airlines are being run now can only be fixed by outside regulation.
18636371	This was the best post and it's disappointing to see only 2 comments. What the other writers do not seem to grasp is that we the taxpayers fund airports, TSA, the roads to and from the airports, many of the employees, etc. In that sense, we have a vested interest and a right to know what is really going on. Shopping for fares on the internet is a joke-- usually when it comes right down to it, the buyer has to choose the most expensive option as that is the only workable arrangement.	Taxpayers deserve to know what is going on in Airline industry because we pay for airports, TSA and airport roads and some employees. It is often difficult to shop for fares because the most expensive option is usually the only feasible arrangement.
18636153	Also egregious are the fees for checked baggage, at $25 - $35 per bag. This has resulted in the need for far more TSA agents, a cost paid by the taxpayers and thus a government subsidy. If the industry is subsidized, the government has every right to step in and regulate.	The cost of checked bags has also caused more TSA to be needed ,costing taxpayers more, government should regulate this. The government has every right to regulate, if the industry is subsidized.
18633331	We, and our government, have allowed the airlines to consolidate down into monopolies. Air travel is really no different than any other travel, a human necessity that should be copiously regulated. Make airlines like utilities, available and accountable to everyone.	Airlines have become a monopoly. Air travel, like other travel, should be copiously regulated. Air travel is a service that should be available and accountable to all citizens.
20644706	My 91 year old mother just broke her hip, had hip replacement surgery and 3 weeks of rehab. Medicare plus her supplemental insurance covered everything 100% and she didn't get any confusing EOB's, bills from every person at the hospital, the ambulance, etc., etc. Wish I had Medicare!!!!!! I have a $10k deductible and every time I go to the dr. I get multiple statements from the dr., the insurer, the lab, etc. Never can match the EOB to the dr. statement and invariably I am overcharged for something. I have a graduate degree and can never make heads or tails of the stuff I get and comparing plans is a nightmare. No way should the elderly (or even the young) be subject to this insane insurance system that most of us have to deal with!!!!	In a recent experience, my mother used Medicare for a broken hip and it was simple and covered everything. Elderly and young people shouldn't have to deal with an insane insurance system.
20655821	These science fiction proposals might be worth entertaining if the problem hadn't already been solved dozens of times over by other industrialized nations. The cure for excessive prices (resulting from inability of patients to evaluate value, as well as Roemer's law) is a monopsony. Medicare is a grand monopsony. Let it work!	Medicare has excessive prices.
20654771	"Enrollees could select health plans that meet their needs, instead of the needs of politicians and lobbyists. They could choose innovative plans . . ." As people age, although perhaps Mr. Cannon has not yet met any senior citizens so doesn't realize this, they have difficulty making decisions. They would probaly need to depend on someone who would easily target them to take advantage of them, as happens all the time. This approach strikes me as mean, callous, thoughtless. Medicare works.	Reforming medicare would cause senior citizens to have to make decision, which they find increasingly difficult to do as they age. Medicare prevents the elderly from being taken advantage of by immoral companies. Medicare doesn't need to be reformed because privatizing the government health care program for the elderly is very callous.
20653659	So the plan is simply to hand an 85-year old senior citizen a cash payment and put the onus on them to decide if a procedure or test their doctor tells them they need is a good idea or not; when they're short on food and rent, and are trying to save money. If the goal is to reign in healthcare costs, it seems to be a far better idea to use the negotiating power of the government (and ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations) to hold healthcare providers accountable for ineffective and unnecessary testing and procedures. What I find most objectionable about the more conservative plans on this forum is that even though they frame their solutions as being mainly about reducing government waste, it really seems to always be about protecting the big monied interests or the super wealthy from ever taking a hit. "Now that we take that as a given, what is the best plan we can come up with?"	Rather than reforming Medicare, it would make more sense to lower healthcare costs by holding providers accountable for treatment.
20645885	Here is the fundamental issue that separates the two choices being presented. The Republicans, and libertarian groups like the Cato Institute, think that the "market knows all and can fix all." A foolish assumption ignoring decades of reality. Turning Medicare into a voucher program and letting people "shop" puts all the financial burden onto the backs of people who can least afford it. Healthcare costs will continue to rise until a "pay for quality and results" model gets fully implemented. Without that these vouchers will never be allowed to grow in value equal to the healthcare inflation rate. So they will become less valuable and the poor and seniors will suffer. In an ACA-type model, or better yet, a single payer model, implemented with a solid "pay for performance" component, the government shoulders the burden of increasing healthcare costs, not the poorest and most vulnerable, and the government takes the responsibility of driving pricing reform because individual consumers cannot do this.	Healthcare costs will rise until it gets reconstructed. The government takes the burden of healthcare costs in the ACA model because consumers can't.
20662266	I still get the felling that Mr. Ryan et al are concerned about cutting government spending and not my health. If "vouchers" or "payments" for private insurance would be more efficient, better for me, and save the government money, then why not let beneficiaries choose a plan with the bill going directly to the government for payment. The government will quickly learn if it is cheaper or more expensive. Mr. Capretta : "More than 30 percent of all Medicare enrollees have voluntarily chosen to get their Medicare-covered benefits through these Medicare Advantage plans." Yes, but what of the argument that such options have already led to a reduction of the bargaining power of traditional Medicare? Mr. Cannon: "Enrollees would avoid wasteful medical care because they would get to keep the savings." Yes, but aren't you just saying that decisions made between a doctor and their patient for referred visits or treatments should squashed by anxiety over payment?	Beneficiaries should be able to choose a plan paid directly to the government. 30% of people are already supplementing their medicare.
20654401	Why not fix it all at once ? First make Ryan and his congressional crony's provide " the beyond a doubt evidence " that removing the present benefits of Medicare for the old and decrepit actually/really needs to be done to save the country from the calamitous mess they and their forbearers have spent us into... after they can't and won't do that then insist Medicare be expanded and opened, over time, to all ages at the expense of the profit interests of health insurance companies who will then get completely out of the health business and into some other business.	The Medicare problems should be addressed all at once. If Ryan cant prove Medicare expenses are too much for the country then it needs to be expanded to all ages and paid for by health insurance companies which would close their bushiness instead.
20654215	Even better would be to roll the benefits of Medigap Plan F into the traditional Medicare program wherein the net costs of a single program would be much less because it would eliminate the profound administrative excesses and extra expenses of the Medigap plans. If we did that, along with other modifications that would improve Medicare, we would have a plan that would be far more efficient and effective than anything the private sector could ever produce - a single payer national health program, an improved Medicare for all, making health care affordable for all of us.	medicare needs to be improved or changed to help the older generation. Despite the goals of Congressional Republicans, the most efficient and effective solution for affordable health care starts with Medicare reform.
20653695	As someone new to Medicare but with experience helping an over 90 year old parent 1500 miles away I'm concerned that people in their 80's and 90's need a simpler system. My mom was a savy businesswoman into her late 70's but the paperwork and choices she had to deal with in Medicare plans and bills where overwhelming. Advertisers need to be vetted to eliminate bogus companies that prey on vulnerable trusting seniors. And Any changes need to be tested with a group of aged seniors. Many do not have the ability to wade through the decisions and lack someone to help.	Medicare needs to be a simpler system for people in their 80's and 90's. Dealing with Medicare means dealing with a lot of paperwork and overwhelming bills. There needs to be some sort of vetting process for advertisers, some of them attempt to scam the elderly. Changes should be tested with seniors. People don't have the ability to make good decisions about medical care.
20644762	1) I like my Medicare. 2) It works w/o hassle. 3) The government has enough clout to negotiate prices 4) Administrative cost are low. 5) There are no profits to satisfy Wall Street and investors. So "tell the the government to keep their hands off my Medicare."	Medicare functions well the way it is. Medicare shouldn't be reformed because it works. The government should maintain administration of Medicare because they can negotiate prices. The costs of it are relatively low. Medicare does not make profits to satisfy Wall Street.
20647288	Medicare is excellent insurance and doesn't need to be changed into a voucher Program. No insurance company wants to sell insurance to a 90 year old man with a 'Coupon'. Any intelligent person can tell this is a hoax to give the rich more tax breaks. Why can't Ryan tell the truth. He is a Pinocchio who can't stop lying. A well known enemy of poor people. Catholic Churches have come out against him. Seniors who voted for Trump were conned.	Medicare works just fine as it is. A 90 year old man would have difficulty buying coverage from any insurance company.
20644868	Questions: 1.How much money has the somewhat privitized Medicare Advantage saved the program so far? answer=NONE 2.How many countries have such a program as this that has saved $$$? answer=NONE 3.How many countries have government based programs that cost considerably less, provide higher quality metrics than ours with comparable patient satisfaction and provide considerably more comprehensive services? answer>30. 4.Why would seemingly logical people propose such a system without any existent instance of evidence it will work? answer= They are either naive ideologues who don't understand the scientific method or in the pay of one or another of the medical oligarchs.	The current privatized Medicare program has saved no money yet. No other countries have been able to save money with similar programs. Many other countries have government based programs at less cost with higher quality.
20648193	RE the CBO article cited: I read it. Here are a few things I get from it ... "Under current law, the growth of Medicare spending will be restrained in other ways during the next two decades, thus limiting the potential for the government to realize further savings from a premium support system." And, "...spending for Medicare is projected to be restrained by provisions of the Affordable Care Act that will change the ways and amounts that health care pro- viders and insurers are paid." Why go through such drastic changes to a system to save 6% "as a Percentage of Net Federal Spending for Medicare"? Particularly when those "savings" are costs picked up by the enrollee or pocketed in profits by private insurers or provider? Not that 6% (45b) is anything to laugh at, but surely a small uptick in my taxes would cover this?	Medicare is projected to be restrained by provisions of the Affordable Care Act. It will change the ways and amounts that health care providers and insurers are paid. Medicare savings are typically picked up by the enrollee.
20645033	The entire Republican agenda regarding healthcare is to siphon off tax dollars to give to insurance companies and not to provide any health care. Same with Social Security, privatize it giving billions to Wall Street to manage to garner fees and lose recipients hard earned money. What a bunch of crooks. Leading the way is the American Enterprise Institute. Super crooks.	The Republican's want to transfer tax dollars to insurance companies without providing health care.
20644820	People like my husband who fights squamous cell skin cancer would never be able to afford insurance or they would cut him off with max benefits at some point. I pay a lot in medicare premiums and use almost no services, so it sort of balances out. These proposed changes would throw even some wealthier patients to the wolves as charges are so high even a relatively well off person could easily go broke.	People with serious ailments wouldn't be able to afford insurance, or would be cut off of their insurance. The money spent by healthy people balances out those of the sick in medicare. Proposed changes would throw even some wealthier patients to the wolves, as charges are so high even a relatively well off person could easily go broke.
18362833	Ahh no. First the problem isn't Google's market share. The problem is they are an American company that is wildly successful. The Europeans always try to destroy those companies. It is a form of protectionism but we refuse to identify it as such. I have a choice to use google or several something elses.	Google is simply a wildly successful American company. People can choose not to use Google.
18369303	"If governments reward such success with a regulatory straitjacket, we will pay a steep price." Oh please. When has a long term monopoly EVER been good for the market? Uhhh...never. Yes, Apple, Google and Facebook owners deserve to get rich for creating unique products and markets, but in the last years they are expending more and more money on flimsy patent fights and trying to raise the bar for market entry too high for competition. It has happened with *every* firm that has had a monopoly. The "regulation" scare is bogus.	Monopolies are not good for the market. The creators of google apple and facebook deserve money for their creations, but they are raising the bar too high for competition.
18362282	Ryan Radia writes like someone who is a newbie to Android. He could get better informed by following XDA-Developers, AndroidCentral, or a similar group of people who understand Android. Mr. Radia could also visit the PlayStore and look at all the applications, like Titanium Backup, that require root access to function. App Quarantine Pro, would let you lock down crapware so that it does not run down your battery, slow your device, or spy on you. You cannot use sophisticated spyware blockers because that interferes with Google, the device manufacturers and the networks from selling your personal data. Google, the device makers, and the networks, collude to prevent people from actually owning their devices. If they really belonged to us, we would be able to install software to backup them up to an external hard-drive. We would be able to decide which applications to uninstall. We would be able to decide upon the rules applications have to follow when they are on our devices, not the "take it or leave it" practices we have at present.	Spyware blockers tend to interfere with not only Google, but certain device manufacturers and networks. Google does not allow the user choices in device format.
15377521	The International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Banks have been acting like extortionist racketeers! If I were the head of state of one of the other euro-zone countries, I would initiate procedures to leave the euro-zone immediately, based on the morally depraved way they have bullied Greece into financial ruin. Most of the "money" used to create those so-called "loans" was "created out of thin air" to begin with, so the co-called "lenders" of those loans will lose NOTHING if Greece "defaults" on those "loans".	European Central Banks,The International Monetary Fund, the European Commission have all been behaving like criminals. Greece has gone into deep financial ruin so it would be in their best interest to leave the euro.
15370368	The banksters cannot afford for Greece to leave the Euro and set up a public banking system that would be an example to Spain, Italy and all the rest of the struggling Eurozone countries. The Eurozone was created to benefit the private banks and big corporations. It is a return to feudalism in contemporary diguise.	Banks cannot leave the Euro because it would make other countries struggle. It would go back to feudalism.
15368320	If the income tax collectors are threatened by Greeks who refuse to pay their taxes, what hope is there? The Greeks need to collect their income taxes. That would pay off a lot of debt & keep them in the euro.	The Greeks should collect income tax. Greece would be able to pay off a lot of debt with the Euro.
15377864	Bring back the drachma. If the Greek economy is slack, they can devalue the drachma to encourage foreign tourists and investment. They can also control their own destiny -- the basic concept of democracy which they created. Having Germany dictate how their government and economy should run doesn't make sense either for Germany or Athens. A Greece free of the Euro would be a happier and more prosperous Greece. The Euro is currently designed for industrial super powers like Germany, not for fun, sun-loving, life affirming Greece.	Greece should abandon the Euro so they can make their currency worth less, to encourage tourism and investment. Germany trying to run Greece's government and economy doesn't work. Greece would be happier and more prosperous without the Euro. The Euro is more beneficial for superpowers like Germany, not places like Greece.
15372665	At this stage of the game of the perpetuation of fundamentally flawed economic system Greece will be cutting its own throat to abandon the Euro. Not only that is not practical but Greece is in no position to isolate itself and sacrifice poor millions with impunity. The best practical course would be that $1.8 billion debt is forgiven	The economic system is fundamentally flawed so it would be bad for Greece to abandon the Euro. Greece should not isolate itself and sacrifice the many poor with impunity.
15371571	Although leaving Euro would be difficult, that seems to be the only way left for Greece. If they don't leave Euro, the ECB will never realize how important it is to maintain a country's infrastructure and tradition. As a currency Euro is a badly conceived currency. It has got the economic power but not the political power or control. As everyone knows, economic power without political power is like putting the cart before the horse. It frustrates everyone and ends up into a blame game. Greece would be wise to leave Euro and implement some what harsher economic policies than what they have got.	Greece leaving the ECB would demonstrate that they need to help a countries infrastructure and tradition. The Euro is badly conceived for Greece. While financially it is possible, they lack political control. It is in Greece's best interest to have their own strict economy.
15367496	leaving the Euro will hurt the hedge funders and the bankers but it is what the people need. The Greek rank and file (not the oligarchs that we hear so much about avoiding their taxes) need to get out from under German-imposed austerity, which is hurtful, counter-productive and verging on sadistic. The change will be bumpy but after a few months, the Euro will be but an unpleasant memory to the Greeks. The Spaniards are next.	Greece leaving the Euro will hurt hedge funders and bankers, but benefit the people.
15368521	"Greece should have defaulted on its debt back in 2010 and left the euro zone." It should indeed have done so and it should do so now. There is simply no way that the austerity prescribed for Greece by the Troika can do other than drive the country to economic suicide. This outcome is already proven by the experience of the Austerity so far. Leaving the debt behind does not require heroic assumptions about "highly efficient and productive in order to survive in a globalized environment". To my mind it is a risk worth taking by the Greek people; in the famous words of Margaret Thatcher "There is No Alternative (TINA)".	Back in 2010, Greece really should have defaulted on their debt. Austerity is causing severe economic downturn in Greece.
3281317	We have to start somewhere and this is as good a place as any. We are all participants in a huge public experiment: first, when it came to large scale food production, then to packaged foods and fast foods, and now to mass produced balanced nutrition. I applaud Walmart for taking the lead. I hope they also restructure their store configurations so you find the good stuff in the front and have to dig for the sinful stuff in the back. Think back to the colorful markets of the past (and still in the Caribbean and Pacific islands as well as throughout Europe) and the popular street markets of today (Union Square in NYC and the waterfront markets in Seattle) and perhaps you'll be writing a success story soon. If not, try and try again. It took time to do it, hopefully it will take less to undo it. Thanks for taking the lead Walmart.	Walmart is a good place to start getting healthy.
3284107	Another false corporate effort, like the bleats from the oil companies about how much they spend (sic) to save the environment or the periodic efforts of fast food chains to convince us they have healthy menus for us before they turn around in the next advertising cycle and again propose we eat cheese, bacon and grease/fat sandwiches. Blame refrigerators/freezers that allow us to buy and store all the junk purveyed. When people ate day to day they didn't gobble down so much. Half of our burgeoning national medical bill is sourced to the diseases of obesity. Eat up, America!	The inherently dishonest efforts of large companies to encourage positive change are always short-lived, as oil companies and fast food giants have previously proven.
3282462	I disagree with the majority that Wal Mart is "taking a step in the right direction". The "step" is just too small over too long a time span. They are not going to do anything, ultimately, that will hurt their bottom line--they are a corporation. Public health is the government's job, but we've let the right turn that simple truth on its head to the point where we are thanking Wal Mart for the tiniest little concession--that is aimed more at improving their image that improving public health. When they stop the system of suppliers paying for a prominent space on the shelf and put the (non-instant) oatmeal where the sugary boxed cereal is and offer a demonstration of how simple it is to make oatmeal for breakfast (instead of pushing cereal bars, which are basically candy bars), I might start to think they are serious.	I do not agree with everyone else. Walmart needs to make more of an effort faster. Corporations like Wal-Mart will never do anything that will hurt their bottom line. Wal-mart's changes do more for its image than public health; it is the government's job to look out for public health.
3285182	I like this initiative. Wal-Mart is doing a good thing for its customers. Wal-Mart definitely deserves praise for using its power for good for once. Wal-Mart has caused many small businesses to go under and has had serious labor issues over the years. It really owes its customers and employees for their loyalty (even if, in some situations, Wal-Mart is the only game in town) and this healthy food initiative is a wonderful way to start.	Wal-Mart is doing well for trying to help consumers eat better. A healthy food initiative is a great way for Wal-Mart to show its loyalty to customers.
3284893	This is a great move by Wal-Mart. I hope they take out all the high fructose corn syrup out of their products as well. I avoid anything with high fructose corn syrup and as a result I have lost 37 pounds.	Wal-mart trying to help us be healthier is good. Taking out things like high fructose corn syrup has lead to weight loss for me.
3302960	Asking a question about Wal Marts morality is offensive. The only thing that concerns them is the fast buck, and they have the money and power to make every devious argument in their favor. When they with the aid of hired politicians drive all competition to complete impotence, their utter disregard for the general welfare will cost us dearly.	Wal-Mart is only looking out for themselves and their bottom line, they are not looking to help others. We will pay dearly when Walmart has driven out all competition.
3281388	The new school meal guidelines from USDA will be far more of a game changer than anything WalMart does. They also will be far more effective in terms of giving manufacturers good reason to invest the money and effort to develop new products that meet the guidelines while maintaining taste. The fact is, such products on the shelves of WalMart will always have the competition from less healthy products such as you allude to. If you want to sell the vast school market, the playing field will be level. The real question is whether local school boards will accept the idea that they can't use school food programs to cross subsidize education, and that Federal school meal reimbursements need to go towards school meal production, not school bureacracy overheads.	New school meal guides will be more effective than Wal-Mart's plan to cut uneeded calories in food. There will still be unhealthy products available in Wal-Mart.
16637115	As an alcoholic now 24 years sober, I can say that this is 100% true. My employer had to threaten to fire me from a great job before I went to treatment. 24 years later, no relapses and a better way to live. The Army trains people the same way. Change their behavior and their attitudes will shift.	A former alcoholic believes everyone should be forced into help. Addicts will benefit from being coerced into treatment. The Army forces people into training. Treatment can change the behavior of drug addicts which will change their attitudes.
16635954	Of course addicts should be committed for treatment. Unfortunately, we got in to this voluntaryism with mental health and addictive disorders, basically because it was cheaper. Everyone knows that it is, first: illegal to use band substances and second; that it is impossible to kick on your own, unless you are superman or woman. Let's give people a chance. Care about them. Do the right thing by them. Don't enable them.	The only good reason to not put drug addicts into treatment is people worried about cost. Treatment gives people a chance.
16634255	Forcing a person to do something never works. People are defiant when they are addicted to a substance and just forcing something on them can have an even greater negative effect if they aren't ready to accept they have a problem. If the person truly wants help them help should be available but not forced. When an addict has there white flag waving that they are done with that life then a program should be ready to get them into a correct treatment facility.	Forcing a person to do something is never effective. Addiction causes defiance, and forcing a person's hand does more harm than good.
16634149	Marijuana, cocain, heroin and opiates should be legal, regulated for safety and taxed appropriately. Just give the people what they want. If they don't want it, they shouldn't buy it or use it. However, do not, ever, come ask me to treat abusers. If they want it, and want to legalize it, fine. But leave me out of the mess it creates.	Some don't want to treat abusers.
16633504	When Dupont refers to "research," I assume he's referring to his linked report, "Results from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health," and to Figure 7.10 in that report, the pie chart labeled "20.2 million needing but not receiving treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use," which says that 95.5% said that they "Did not feel they needed treatment." Among the problems with that chart is (1) they don't tell how they defined "needing" or determined who "needed" it (2) they they include marijuana in the category of "illicit drug." The bulk of those 20.2 million could be marijuana users. Even with heroin, amphetamines and cocaine, you can't just assume that because somebody is using that drug, he or she is abusing it or "needs" treatment. Many people function well even while using those drugs. For example, Ayn Rand used amphetamines. Allen Ginsberg used amphetamines. You could spend a whole semester course reading books that had been written on amphetamines. Should they have been forced into treatment?	It does not state how they define who "needs" treatment, and marijuana is included in the category of ""illicit drugs". You can't assume that someone using a drug is abusing it and needs treatment. Drug use does not impair function for many people,.
16633486	Forcing an addict into recovery will just make them fall back into it even harder. An addict first needs to accept they have a problem, then after that they HAVE to actually want help. Nothing good comes from forcing them to get help.	An addict will fall back when forced into recovery. Addicts forced into treatment will not help because they accept the problem then want help to succeed. Forcing addicts into treatment will not have good results.
16632994	As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done . Just like mandatory seat belts in all US states the same could be argued for mandatory substance abuse treatment	Treatments for substance abuse is very effective. It's a way of getting the thousands of people to get treatment. Patients left to make their own decision sometimes will not make the right one. There is a drug epidemic in the country leading to many young deaths. Massachusetts Gov. thinks hospitals should make drug addict treatment mandatory, just like seat belts are mandatory for all drivers.
16632833	Mass. already has a statute permitting civil commitment for addictions. (MGL c .123, sec. 35) so his legal advisors didn't do their homework here. What we don't have are the beds for rehab.. Gov. Baker is putting the cart before the horse. We don't need another law; the tools are already in place for the courts to use their coercive powers; the court clinicians who advise the judges, however, are frustrated by the lack of places to put people who need the nonexistent beds.	Another law is not needed when tools are already in place for the courts.
16632769	"cunning, baffling and powerful disease of addiction" - LOL no. This is called 'demon possession'. Let people do drugs. They'll go through a phase and then they'll get tired of it and then they'll be fine. UNLESS they end up in treatment and must confess a disease of free will, in which case all bets are off.	The addict should tire of the addiction before treatment.
16631058	I could not agree more, having lost friends and family members to addiction. This is not as some believe a violation of civil liberties--no one is less free than the addict. Tom, this "mere injection of a substance" as you put it destroys lives, turns people into into monsters who literally steal from their own families. I have seen so many people end up in prison or die from this. You can't imagine the helplessness of family and friends as they watch someone fall prey to addiction, powerless to intervene. I'm no fan of the prohibition of soft drugs but in the case of opiate, crack, and meth addiction, *enough.*	Drug addicts should be treated before they are lost to addiction. The addict should be forced into treatment, as they are slaves to their addiction, and cannot make a sound decision themselves. People can end up in prison or die from drug addiction. It is heartbreaking to watch an addict spiral to their death when all you want to do is help them.
16637127	Coerced treatment has been used for decades with addicted physicians - and has proved incredibly effective. Physicians with drug/alcohol use disorders, when reported, are placed on strict treatment protocols of random drug testing and counseling. 85 % of physicians placed in coercive treatment complete the treatment and are able to continue to practice medicine,	Physicians who are forced into drug treatment have proven positive results.
16633208	Problem is in Massachusetts (and other places) there is NO where to place these patients/addicts. Sounds like a good idea, (sort of), on camera or in writing, to force people into help but there is no there there. No facilities or beds period. Sort of putting the horse in front of the cart. Build them and then just maybe they will come. Where I live (pop. 230,000), there's exactly one small, public rehab center currently with a 6-8 month wait list. We simply don't have the infrastructure in place to accept (or force) people into receiving help. Honestly I don't think the money nor the will is really there. A lot of lip service from our politicians. I question the Gov's proclamation. Did not anyone on his team do the research to discover we've no place to put them?	We do not have the infrastructure in place to force people into receiving treatment. Drug addicts should not be forced into treatment because it is expensive and addicts do not want to be there.
16632351	Treatment is much better than jail or prison but neither seems to have much of a track record for helping the addicted. I know parents who have sent their kids to treatment multiple times and the addict takes up drinking or drugs as soon as they are released. Treatment is expensive and WE pay for health care for the homeless and hopelessly addicted who live on the streets or at the bottom of the social ladder. Proven treatment that works and is affordable - Yes. A simple money machine for providers with little or no success in treatment - NO. The BIG problem is getting to the Yes.	It isn't proven to fully help addicts. An addict forced into treatment is likely to take the habit back up as soon as they are released. It's too expensive to pay for treatment when we already pay for health care for the homeless and addicts. Providers make money whether or not there is success in treatment.
9974411	LOL - I love the fact that even though the NYTimes clearly weighted the debate in favor of pageant supporters, the idea that a beauty pageant is somehow a great thing for women is getting completely slammed in the comments. Men are considered to have too much individual dignity and worth to be judged on something as shallow as what they look like in a bathing suit. That's why beauty pageants are only for women. We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of little girls and young women, thanks to trashy parents. Just ask Honey Boo Boo.	People support beauty pageants because there is money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of girls and women.
9974255	Every Miss Anything pageant is nothing more than a cattle call for the sponsor or sponsors' products. The winner is a saleswoman who trapezes around for a year hawking - excuse me, representing - the pageant's sponsors. The losers get to go home and figure out how much they owe for the makeup and beauty lessons they shelled out to compete in the pageant,	Pageants are nothing more than a cattle call for sponsors. Miss America winners participate in promoting the pageant's sponsors. Losers will lose money for makeup and beauty lessons needed to compete.
9971187	"I've also heard the argument that the pageant experience builds confidence and community among the participants; so does "nerding out" on the debate team or flashing across a lacrosse field. (And you still get to wear a skirt, if that's your thing.)" I find it interesting that you use the term "if that's your thing" here, and support the girls who choose to build confidence and community through an experience other than pageantry. What if participating in pageants is "your thing?" By competing in pageants, I've met some of the most intelligent, hardworking young women in my community. I've gotten involved in my community on multiple levels, not just by promoting my personal platform (Empowering teens to prevent dating violence). And I have gained communication skills that helped me to land a successful job in my career field within weeks of my college graduation. Maybe pageants are "my thing." I don't see a problem with that--only the benefits.	The pageant experience builds confidence and community among the participantes. Pageantry and many other activities are ways for girls to build confidence and community through experiences. I have met some smart and hardworking women in my community when I was in pageants. Pageants allowed me to get involve with my community on multiple levels. The pageant improved my communication ability helping in later life.
9971336	Human males have strong instincts to select mates with good physical attributes. Women therefore seek to compete. The same phenomenon can be observed in insects, birds, and other mammals. Displays of fitness vary, and in some it is the females rather than the males that make the displays. So -- what is wrong with it? The process is comfortably Darwinian and it has contributed to our success as a species. I don't see why political correctness should be allowed to get in the way of that -- not that, in reality, you could argue men out of their attraction to beautiful women anyway.	Men, like other animals, will seek out mates that are psysically attractive. The process is like a survival of the fittest.
9975147	My granddaughter entered a pageant to get scholarship money for college, was Miss Nevada and went to Miss America. She went on to college at Willamette U., graduated magnacumlaude, graduated from Georgetown Law JD, graduated with distinction Georgetown Law LL.M and is now a Law Professor at University of Tulsa. She is still beautiful and wise and was able to get this education by scholarships from Miss America and many other honors. All contestants are not only there for their beauty. They are there because of substance to their character and a devotion to give back.	Miss America remains beautiful, wise, and good for women, despite feminist protests claiming racism and sexism. Miss America gives honors and education scholarships. Contestants for Miss America are judged for their character as well as their beauty.
6816351	My worry is the trickle down effect. We already have proof of a father who began doping his son when the child was 12. Legalizing adult doping will necessitate increased juvenile testing programs - even to the elementary level - which tragically may already be needed.	Parents might give them to their children. If doping is legalized, it will be necessary to increase juvenile testing programs.
6861302	To legalize doping/medical alterations is, in a way, forcing all athletes to partake. If, as an athlete, I don't want to take drugs or genetically mutate my body to improve performance, I may as well not even show up. The assumption is made that if it is allowed everyone will participate...which is not necessarily the case. Not to mention that by allowing corporate sponsorship, we create an uneven playing field with the rich vs. poor countries. The olympics would become more about which countries can afford the best technology as opposed to the spirit of the sport.	If doping is legalized, athletes are encouraged to participate. For athletes who choose to not use drugs, the competition wouldn't be fair. If it were allowed, it would be unfair because not everyone would participate. If doping were allowed, the Olympics would become about which countries can afford the best technology rather than the spirit of the sport itself.
6818491	allow nothing- test rigorously prior to each event and boot anyone with anything. Its about time we started seeing the athlete'performing and not the training aids. Id let the ping pong players have an Advil, but everyone else should be as clean as clean can be. Its enough that we have to accept trivialized sports activities lets not let real competetion get to where we are watching the latest wonder drug or blood treatment instead of the athlete.	We need to see the athlete performing, not the performance aid. Sports would become a competition of drug effectiveness, not athletic ability.
6816376	Another instance where sports is different from real life. We ALL use PEDs, Viagra enhances sex life, hair products help deter hair loss, diet products help lose weight, many medicines enhance life. Get over it and stop making sports special because of the Hall of Fame.	Life and health enhancing medicines are commonly used by many.
6813091	I think this sets a precedent for young people we do not want to go to. With the legalization of doping products we are telling our kids that it's okay to use enhancement drugs? So in high schools we will allow our athletes to use steroids? This is the message we want to send to our children? I understand that the consideration of what might be considered allowable is arbitrary, but using the argument that pasta is enhancing, or water is, is ridiculous. Nourishing the body is one thing, enhancing performance is another. What happened to just humans competing against humans? Now it's my drugs vs yours?	Legalization will promote use in youth athletes. Enhancing performance is not like nourishing the body. Allowing doping will turn athletics into a chemical competition instead of a human one.
6812862	Once again we see the quiet but deadly hand of money driving attitudes and decisions. Why not rise to the challenge, not tame it with the latest concoction? What age is ok? Who gets decide if high school kids can take 'safe' drugs. What an absurd argument. Keep it simple: ibu, gatorade and gu .... what else to you need? In the end, it's not about the contestants, it's all about the once beautiful idea that every four years the world would take a break and come together to celebrate youth, endeavor and camaraderie.	At what age does this practice begin? Would this be a safe practice for children?.
6814608	Whoever sees room for debate here is just shoveling sand into the growing tide of public revulsion against doping in sports. And the public is right. When the doors open to performance enhancement drugs, they close for the person who does not wish to take drugs in order to compete. I'm not sure exactly who benefits from that outcome, but it's definitely not your kid swinging at softballs in the backyard this summer. Why call it sport if it's to become just a contest to see who can round up the best set of drugs plus the most short-term-minded, health-reckless contestants, coaches, doctors and parents? There was a time when sports competition was about sport. Against great odds today, it still is that for some competitors. They give their best effort and accept either defeat or triumph as just a part of every game, not its only measure. Those competitors are worthy of being our kids' sports hereoes. Who are they now? It's sad that we have to wonder. It's even sadder to contemplate a sports world in which all the winners are on drugs.	The are just shoveling sand into the growing tide of public revulsion. If performance enhancing drugs are allowed it will be unfair to those not interested in taking them. The kids playing sports for fun aren't benefiting from doping. Sports should not be a contest to see who can get the best drugs to impress. It would be worse if all the winners were taking drugs.
6812570	There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other). Would games become even more a show of force between the haves and the have nots?	Doping affects the persons long term health for a short term gain. Doping gives an unfair advantage to certain players which bothers me,. Allowing these drugs would create a larger gap between wealthier players and those who are less so.
6812058	This used to anger me, now it doesn't. The drugs are here to stay. Olympic athletes use them, pro wrestlers, mixed martial arts, cyclists, baseball and football players, runners, even the young guys in the gyms around the country. That's why you see so many young men who look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. They don't spend 7 hours in the gym everyday to look like that..They spend about an hour per day, take a boatload of pills, powders and/or some injections, and eat a pretty good diet with low carbs and lots of protein. I can lift as much as a lot of them, but I'm a bald old guy who doesn't inject anything and I look like it. Who the heck wants to look like me? We need to just let it go. If their livers rot out by the time they're 40, that's their problem. They already decided it's worth looking and performing like a stud for a short time, rather than a noodle for a long time.	Doping should be allowed because everyone is going to use them anyway. The sports industry should stop testing for doping. It is their own discretion if they want to take drugs that will affect only themselves in the long run.
6816976	Given the power that money has over most people's decision making, this might just be an idea worth trying. Bottom line, the use of performance-enhancing drugs is disgusting and has caused many people to lose interest in sports, both as competitors and as fans.	The use of performance enhancing drugs by athletes has turned off many competitors and fans.
13080390	As long as any significant portion of the Palestinian people continue to declare war on Israel's existence, there will never be a Palestinian state. First, and foremost, because that same significant percentage of Palestinians would not accept a sovereign state without first seeing the end of Israel. And Britain should be ashamed of accepting a circumvention of civil liberty by accepting any form of sharia law into the British legal system. What moral cowards do is of no consequence to the well being of western freedoms.	If Palestine can't be peaceful with Israel they shouldn't be recognized as a state. Many Palestinians want an end to the state of Israel before accepting Palestine as a sovereign state.
13083724	Such a move would not be in the interest of the sons and daughters of Haganah, Irgun and the Stern Gang. Nor in the interest of Mossad, Shin Bet, Israel Defense Force, Likud and the Israel Lobby including AIPAC. But it would be in the interest of 6 million Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians living under occupation, blockade/siege, exile and 2nd class citizenship beneath and beholden to 6.1 million Zionist Israeli Jews.	Would it be helpful for the Palestinians currently living as 2nd class citizens in Israel?.
13082589	"The international community will not invest power, prestige and funds to chaperone an artificial "state" Oh yes they will, just as they approved another $5.8 billion to rebuild Gaza. Let's not pretend the millions of Westerners who sympathize with the Palestinians hold no sway with their governments, and that the Arab world doesn't care about Palestinians because that is patently false, or perhaps wishful thinking. But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a "modern marvel" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza?	Westerners  and Arab states who sympathize with Palestine can petition their governments to support it.
13079928	As Caroline Glicks less than artful use of quotation marks demonstrates, many people, especially Israelis are unwilling to even recognize the existence of the Palestinian people, let alone state. Much easier to appropriate land and refuse to respect anothers basic human rights if you refuse to admit they are even there, or fully human. First and foremost should be the full recognition that a people can be defined by any name they choose and have the right to a voice in establishing their future and a right to equal status under the law. Just as the fact there was no Israel, or Israelis 100 years ago doesn't negate that nations right to self determination, so the same should be for the Palestinians. Nations should recognize the Palestinian people and their right to not be held in legal limbo. Hillel said "That which is despicable to you, do not do to your fellow, this is the whole Torah, and the rest is commentary, go and learn it." It is despicable to me that one people can hold dominion over another. That needs to end, all the rest is just details.	Nations should recognize Palestine because many, specifically Israelis will not. People can be defined by any name they choose and they have a right to  a voice in establishing their future and equal status under the law. In the same way that Israel was allowed nationhood, so should Palestine. Palestine has the right not to be held in legal limbo and other nations should recognize this.
13083664	Both the French and British Empires were present and in control and culpable for the original denial of the human rights of Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians in their natural homeland. These two empires were joined by the American Jim Crow Empire and the Soviet Union Empire to forcibly and without the consent of the people to disenfranchise a Holy Land of Palestine that was 65% Palestinian based upon European Christian nation state and faith crimes against Jewish humanity. When Abram of Ur, Sumer (modern Iraq) claimed that his god commanded him and his heirs to invade and occupy the land of others in his name killing, wounding and displacing the men, women and children then living there a dangerous inhuman inhumane precedent was set. There is no excuse for repeating that mistake with dueling scriptures and prophets in an age of science and reason and civilization.	It is partly France and Britans fault that the Christian Muslim Arab Palestinians are being denied rights in their homeland. Nations should recognize a Palestinian state because it was disenfranchised due to the influence of American and Soviet pressure.
13081691	What position is the "British Ambassador to Tel Aviv"? I didn't know there were ambassadors to cities. Is this a non-recognition of Israel as a state? I am in favor of a Palestinian state or any solution that will bring peace to two nations who have suffered too much. But recognition goes both ways.	There needs to be a solution that will bring peace to the nations.
13080013	The usual tripe and nonsense from an apologist for the Arab Terror Method of Political Engagement. When the adults amongst us see arab muslims grant and respect the sovereign rights of others in the middle east, including the kurds, yazidis, azeri, bahai, cop tics, maronites, chaldeans, maneachans, and jews, THEN I might begin to believe that the relentless, mindless commitment to war and violence by arab muslims against all others might be ceased, and there might be peace achieved in the mideast. The juvenile pandering by feckless, hypocritical European regimes 3,000 miles away from the nearest hostile arab muslim-majority state affirm the general lack of respect that should be granted to the European perspective. Their dictates as to how Israel should be treating a population whose majority supports terrorism against it are wholly meaningless. Bargohouti of course offers the usual bile about Israel and a 2-state solution, and then exposes himself as nothing but a despicable liar by demanding that millions of arab muslims be allowed to move into Israel, despite have no legal foundation to do so. The NYT can do better.	Nations shouldn't pander these regimes to affirm the lack of respect.
13082711	Quite simply, the Palestinian authority needs to recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, and Hamas (if they're a participant) needs to disavow its commitment to the destruction of Israel and the Jews. Until that happens, it's hard to see how any rational, objective person could support Palestinian statehood.	Palestinian statehood should not be recognized because they refuse to acknowledge Israel's statehood and they allow Hamas to operate within their country.
13081793	Sweden and Great Britain have open the gates for recognition of a Palestinian state at UN. Sooner than later, the majority member countries will follow suit. The (official line) arguments presented by Ms. Leibovich come too little, too late. Israel has always ignored UN pledges for good faith negotiations with the Palestinians because US unwavering support. Washington, however, is losing diplomatic control over its allies and friends. Israel soon will be facing (another) awkward diplomatic position at the UN. It will be occupying land of an invaded sovereign state recognized by the world community. A good challenge for the able Israeli-American diplomacy to defend at the UN.	It will happen eventually.
13080475	I'm not a Palestinian or an Israeli, so I don't have a dog in this fight. However, as a basic principle, it is a fundamental right of any nation to have a homeland and it is only that people's decision to declare their independence and establish their own state.	It is a basic right for any nation to have a homeland, and only that country can establish their own state.
13081146	Israel would be more likely to negotiate with Palestine if it was recognized by other governments. These other governments would expect any Palestinian government to prevent attacks by its citizens on Israel or any other country. Recognition by other countries would make it easier for Palestine to fulfill the basic elements of statehood. It would rally Palestinians behind a policy that was achieving some change. Of course, they have to rally behind the policy to the extent that they will help the police track and stop extremists, even if the extremists are relatives. But in the West Bank this has been pretty much achieved. If Israel could abandon some of its settlements and prevent any terrorism by extremists who opposed this abandonment, and Palestine could prevent terrorism by extremists who opposed the recognition of Israel, we would have something workable.	Making it a state would force Israel to negotiate with them as an equal. Many governments expect a Palestinian government to prevent attacks by its citizens on other countries. Palestine would rally behind change creating policies.
13079805	The gestures made by Sweden and Britain's Parliament will stop the Palestinians from considering a compromise on boundaries. As long as Israel is blamed for the failure of negotiations, Palestinians will feel they have no reason to make any concessions to Israel, since the world says that Israel must give up territory and that Palestinians needn't do anything.	Palestine will see no need to make concessions to Israel if Israel is blamed for the failure of negotiations.
13114138	Only with the support of America and its Jewish controlled policies could Israel carry out the atrocious attacks on Palestine, Lebanon and Syria that it has gotten away with in the last fifty years. Justice, humanity, decency, legality have all been put aside by the US policy of support for the Israeli occupiers. As US citizens we have all been forced to sit by silently while our nation has has been disgraced before the sane citizens of the world. The New York Times, centered on the largest Jewish community in the US, is dutifully giving space to the Israel atrocity but will never publish the editorial that justice demands.	Justice and legality aren't taken into account by US policy of support for the occupiers in Israel.
16022936	If businesses want highly productive workers they'll start by changing the goals of the HR department from parts replacement to cultivation. Find out what motivates employees to work there: it will be different for each as they are individuals. Next, monitor managers: if they go through staff it must be for a reason. Fix him/her or replace the manager. Second, get rid of the annual review or the promise of an annual bonus. Instead, establish annual awards that allow anyone a chance at a big prize. I've made significant contributions to companies where I've worked and seen my hard work go to some hand-picked politico who did little but criticize me while I did the major lifting. The same with the annual review. Simply offer the worker more if he deserves it and be done with it. If the employee wants a review then let him/her suffer through it.	Companies can learn employees' motivations for working there. Companies should offer annual awards that give anyone a chance. Good workers should be offered more money.
16020188	I started working when I was 12, at 14 I was working in construction during summers (starting in 1960) making $.50 an hour. My first year paying into Social Security was in 1963 making $1.35 an hour. Last year 2014 as an IT Business Analyst at 68 I made $58 an hour. I never thought that work was fun although in 54 years I have met a lot of people who were fun to work with and that have become good friends.	Work might not be fun, but you can meet people that are fun to work with.
16020227	American culture enshrines one thing: success. In the business world, that means profits. We sacrifice our happiness, relationships, mental health and basically everything else worthwhile in life to achieve a higher bank balance and end up with more assets than those with whom we have been taught since preschool to compete. And then occasionally a little voice pipes up, whether it's from a child, a coworker, a spouse, whomever, reminding us that there are more things out there than our narrow pursuit of gain. But having sold our immortal souls quite literally to pursue wealth, we shut those voices out. Bullying is a virtue in this inverted world where the crassest jungle version of capitalism is to be found.	American's are driven to always seek success, and when it comes to business, success is determined by profit. Making money comes at the cost of not making life worthwhile. The crassest jungle version of capitalism makes bullying a virtue.
16020248	Unions are an endangered species. People are working longer for less pay. Benefits have become a thing of the past. Fire-at-will policies keep people under even more stress. The fact that people are making the best of their bad situation speaks to the resiliency of the human spirit far more than it is a defense of our new American serfdom.	People making the best of their situations speaks to the resiliency of the human spirit more than it is a defense our our poor American work conditions.
16022477	Not being miserable sets the bar pretty low, so why do so many jobs make people miserable anyway? -------------------------- The thing is that there is no evidence that this is so. If you make workers miserable then they will not be working there for very long. A company cannot prosper doing that.	Not being miserable is a very low bar. Miserable workers will not remain at the job for long. If workers are miserable a company will not succeed.
16029367	Totally agree on difference between perks and policies. To me policies are super important to both my own morale and my actual productivity. A lot of policies are counter-productive in stupid ways. That makes me miserable because I WANT to be productive and do a good job. Anything that prevents this, especially from my own team, is super frustrating. Such a waste.	Many policies are counter-productive and workers want to do good work.
6949472	It is rather strange that US foreign policy interests should be undermined by an intransigent and messianic faction in Israel. For the US to fight the threat of Islamic fundamentalism, it is imperative that Israel come to peace with its Palestinian neighbors.	The messianic faction in Israel undermines US foreign policy interests.
6949832	An Iran with nukes would disrupt Israel's cruel and outrageously exercised Mideast hegemony. Israel has ICBM nukes and threatens Iran's very existence, actually campaigns for war against Iran. We must withdraw all sanctions and compensate Iran for damages from the $$ Billions we will no longer be giving Israel annually. American foreign policy must again serve American interests, not AIPAC or the Jewish state's paranoid pursuit of invulnerability, territorial conquest and apartheid empire in, and beyond, the Mideast.	American foreign policy needs to serve American interests, not AIPAC or the Jewish state's paranoid pursuit of apartheid empire in the Mideast.
6953261	I am appalled by the right-wing government in Israel and by the unfailing American support of it. The Israelis seem to believe that if they can only employ enough force, they can solve their problems. This is bankrupt both morally and intellectually.	I can't believe Israels government is so right-wing and that the US keeps supporting it. The Israelis are morally and intellectually bankrupt.
6954613	Israeli exceptionalism should be over So let me get this right, Israel can claim 'ambiguity' over nukes but Iran who is publicly stating 'we're not interested in nukes' is only good for a 'defensive' war started by yourselves? I've heard it all now. And as long as Israel defends nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage', Iran can also defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. So leave Iran alone as long as you allow Israel and any other country to defend its nuclear ambiguity as 'strategic advantage'. If the US and Israel want Iranian nuclear transparency, then Israel better be just as transparent.	US and Israel want no secrets so it is expected that Israel must be honest as well.
7073280	The humanity shares the same values regardless of their belifs, whether they are Jews, Christian, or Muslims. Also the differences in belifes do not gives specific group or any Nation rights to occupy another groups or Nation, because they have different values. That is unjust and unfair. it is not democrtic and not ethical. what professor Khalidi has said is completely right and fair, that our country blindly siding Israel for no common interst. Bitting drumer for war with Iran is unjustified.	Humanity shares the same values, regardless of their beliefs. The Israelis occupation of Palestine is not right. The US sides blindly with Isreal despite what could be proof that it is not the best route. War with Iran is unjustified.
6953532	Exactly! And in return for Obama's embarrassing pandering, we now get blackmailed into yet another war for Israel, a war necessitated by Israel's refusal to compromise and return the occupied territories. AIPAC and the so-called 'Jewish leaders' are the ONLY group supporting foreign interest that our President and Congress have to meet with, day in day out, to 'reassure' and pledge their obedience to Israel's interests, even when it clearly contradicts American interests.	Israel refuses to compromise and return to the occupied territories so we are being blackmailed into another war for them.
6953305	This is time to stop the Arab occupation. Jews have been living in the Land of Israel for thousands of years; even during of times that most of the Jewish people was at exile, and before the Arab occupation and colonialization of the land. It is mind bugling how people are willing to accept this ongoing occupation, just because they think Arabs lived there sine dinosaurs time. Most of the Arab immigrated there parallel to the Zionist immigration in the new era. Read the Ottoman census, the British census and understand the Arab names and origins. Take a look at the big picture; a huge part of the globe is Christian, another huge part of the globe is Muslim. There is a little tiny piece of land for the Jews, and the Liberal of the free world want to take it away.	People seem to believe that since Arabs have lived in the area throughout history, they somehow have a claim to the area.
6950733	US and jweish interests are absolutely mutually exclusive: the visionary George Washington put it succinctly: "A passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification."	The interests of the US and the Jewish are mutually exclusive. Supporting Israel creates sympathy for your favorite nation and can cause you to enter quarrels without proper justification or inducement.
6950675	America absolutely cannot and has loost all credibility as an honest broker a long time ago - except with corrupt Arab despots and dictaters such as was the case with Mubarak and now abdullawhom of saudi arabia whom it nurtures and protects.	The U.S. has lost much of its credibility by consorting with corrupt leaders.
6952583	Regardless of what other commenters think about Palestine and the Palestinians- some of it blatantly racist e.g. that Arabs are a violent people and therefore not worthy of U.S. support, some of it just historically ignorant- e.g. Arafat turned down a peace deal and therefore Palestinians are undeserving of a state forever after - the issue isn't Palestine v. Israel. The issue is whether the U.S. can be an impartial mediator in the dispute. And it cannot. The U.S., for better or for worse, wrongfully or rightfully, has a 'special relationship' with Israel that will always, always, always come first. Regardless of the current state of affairs, of who is on the 'wrong' or 'right' side of the latest iteration of the conflict, the U.S. is in Israel's corner first and the peace process's second. We therefore can never be a true mediator in this issue.	The US cannot be an impartial mediator in Israel. The US can never be a mediator because we support Israel first and have a relationship with them where we will choose their side.
6995121	Solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would take away much of the motivation for terrorism around the world." Everyone's been saying that for years. We should start sending security bills to Tel-Aviv Israel is only bringing the US down in its International Stature and sucking up the tax dollars of Americans across the country! The US is only a pawn in Israel's hands.	Israel is costing the US money and international reputation.
6960717	The question is not whether America has the credibility to coddle and bribe Israel into some decent or judicious place, but why we should help Israel at all! And what can possibly be the point of having a "debate' without admitting that Americans are sick of Israel, and why foment a "debate" dominated, as most "american newspaper" debates now are, dominated by Israelis. Trying to fathom American opinion is not possible. Is it NOT counterproductive to do this phony PR or feel good thing for Israel when American clearly and increasingly sick of Israel and it's troublemaking. The latest constant Isareli screaming to bomb Iran and blackmail America before the election has resulted childish predictable blurbs that don't address or the subject. Who's childish idea was this?	Supporting Israel hurts because most Americans have antipathy toward Israel and American newspapers do not capture the whole story.
6955947	That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests. With fundamentalism on the rise in Israel and America, not to mention Egypt, I fear for the future.	The president cannot even oppose settlements in the West Bank without being criticized. This state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests.
6955398	Israel is such a dishonest broker that this debate is unnecessary. Never mind the crimes against innocent people, never mind the broken promises; how about the atomic bomb they have hidden in plain site. I would agree to disarm Iran if we did the same with Israel. Unfortunately the Jewish lobby in this country spends copious amounts of money to gain political advantage for this rogue country. If they attack Iran, they should reap the whirlwind.	Israel is a dishonest broker and has commited crimes against innocent people. They have broken promises and have an atomic bomb. The Jewish lobby spends a lot of money to gain political advantage for Israel.
6954749	No doubt about that!! I am a Turkish guy living in the US. I can see both sides of the argument. In my opinion, US has to stay neutral between Persian, Arabs and the Israel to be able to pursue its influence in the region. Right now common belief is US is unconditionally supporting Israel and this is hurting its interest in the Middle East. Remember this: Jews (Israel) and Muslims (Arabs, Iranians...) have been fighting for centuries, nobody can stop that. So, why would you position yourself in the middle of the conflict you know nobody can win. I think the answer is; because strong American Jewish lobby, Middle Eastern Warlords and the US Weapon Manufacturers want that way...	US should not take a side in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Muslims and Jews need to resolve their own ongoing issues.
6954953	honest broker? this is ridiculous; we arm israel to the teeth with billions of dollars of military support every year; how much military support do we provide for the palestinians? we are honestly supporting their living under occupation as a broken people.	By arming Israel with military support, we are supporting their living under occupation as a broken people.
6953387	Israel is to the U.S. as North Korea is to China as a spoiled brat is to a feckless parent. Why the U.S. and China would let their number one client states so thoroughly and prominently undermine their own national interests and policies is just totally mystifying. So much for the benefits of superpowerhood.	Supporting Israel is as irresponsible as China supporting North Korea. Supporting Israel causes them to make reckless decisions. Supporting Israel undermines US national interests and policies in such an absurd way it is not understandable.
6949308	I am not clear on what Shared Values Mr. Miller refers to. Israel is based on the Zionist premise of a Jewish state and this philosophy does not grant equal rights to all citizens. This is in total conflict with US values and is akin to apartheid South Africa -as pointed out by Nobel Prize winner Desmond Tutu. As for Israel first influence, it is not only the impact of the agent of a foreign government (AIPAC) but also wealthy donors like Sheldon Adelson who can provide the funds needed to make or break a domestic political campaign. What is worse is that many of these wealthy donors are more politically concerned about Israel than they are about the USA.	Support of Israel is not in line with US values of equality. In general, the majority of the wealthy donors are more worried about Isreal than the USA.
6954381	Israel is destroying American interests in the M.East. The Palestinian People should pursue their dream and free themselves of American influence. America has historically misled Muslims of the Middle East in Favour of Israel. America sees no wrong in lying to the Muslims of the Middle East by allowing Israel to have the Atomic Bombs - Weapon of Mass destruction. If it were not for American Dollars, American Intelligence and American Manipulation the State of Israel would be history.	Israel is acting against American relations in the Middle East. America has historically misled Muslims while allowing Israel to have weapons of mass destruction.
6954416	As long as the US continues to advocate a two-state solution, it will be perceived as pro-Israeli. For the occupation of Palestine to be reversed, and for the apartheid to end, a much more radical solution is needed, namely a one-state solution with equal rights for jews and arabs. This is seen as a major blind spot in US foreign policy. There seems to be no concerted effort to end the oppression of Palestinians. Why not? Everyone assumes that the pro-jewish lobby would never countenance that sort of change. So the impasse continues ad infinitum.	There should be one-state and both Jewish people and Arabs should have equal rights to end the apartheid. Support Israel is a grey area in US foreign policy legislation. No one is trying to stop the oppression of the Palestinians.
6950524	Didn't Menachem Begin once boast that he controlled more votes in Congress than Lyndon Johnson? I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, but I can't deny the reality that I see constantly. Israel through its American supporters has an inordinate amount of influence over American policies. As more and more Americans come to realize this fact, they begin to resent it. I know I do. It must stop.	Israel is influencing American lives.
6949048	Yes, years ago Presidents Nixon, Carter and Bush I were able to buck the pro-Israel community and achieve breakthroughs. A lot has changed since then. The religious right backs Israel for ideological reasons and Israel itself has moved a long way to the right. Obama is resisting efforts to drag the US into military action against Iran but Romney/Ryan are eager for it. Your conditions for success, a plan for peace and relationships with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians based on trust and confidence, are unlikely to be met anytime soon.	Israel has moved closer to the religious right where it gains support for ideological reasons. A plan for peace and leadership relationships to be based on trust and confidence is not likely to succeed anytime soon.
6947879	The Catholics fought the Protestants for centuries in Europe, angry at their cousins' conversion. Now the Israelis are beating up on, discriminating against, stealing land from, destroying the centuries-old housing of, blocking the education of, jailing for decades, their genetic cousins the Palestinians. Are they angry at their conversion to Christianity or Islam?. Why should the United States collaborate with a discriminatory state?	The Israelis are now harming and oppressing the Palestinians which shouldn't be tolerated.
6953350	The israelis have a strong conviction that they are the chosen ones and are entitled to zion and to all the support provided by the US. They do not appreciate what is given to them by the US, but expect it. They hate the arabs, just look at the recent 'lynching' of palestinian by israeli youth. Reminds me of the US before civil rights laws were enacted. When will the civil rights of non-Jews be respected in Israel? When it ceases to be theocracy (never).	Israel doesn't appreciate what we give them. Israeli's hate arabs and that is not a good thing.
6949697	Honest broker? Aid to Palistinians as well as Israel?Palistine gets three billion in Military aid and cutting edge weapons from the USA every year? Really? The USA is a rubber stamp only, for anything, no matter how flagrant the violation of international law and norms, that Israel chooses to do. Any resolution brought before the UN to condem Israel s de-humanizing activities and attrocities against the Palistinians gets an automatic veto from the USA. Honest Broker indeed. Although this writer may have been hiding under a rock over the past fifty years, fortunately the rest of us were not.	The United States' supporting Israel prevents resolutions to condemn dehumanizing activities and atrocities against Palestinians.
6954462	Zionist jews and their supporters were responsible for Palestinian suffering. But the jews have violently determined the fate of Palestinian people and they were and still responsible for their misery and suffering. Palestinian next generations will remember and will never forget or forgive.	Israel is responsible for much suffering of the Palestinian people.
6953351	I do agree that it would be bad for Iran, or any other country for that matter, to develop and possess nuclear weapons. That said, where is the cry for Israel to give up its stockpile of nuclear arms? Israel won't even admit to having them in the first place even though it is quite the open secret that they have them. And yet the US gives Israel millions upon millions of dollars in aid year after year. And let's not forget that Iran is what it is today because of a CIA backed coup which removed the democratically elected government and installed the Shah of Iran in order to protect BP's oil wells.	As a nation, it is well known that Israel has a stockpile of nuclear weapons that they should be forced to give up. Israel receives multi-million dollars worth of aid annually from the US.
6951801	I am simply stunned that the pro Israeli lobby does not grasp that Americans do not want to fight a war with Iran in support of a right wing Israeli government that simply does what it wants to do regardless of the consequences. It is that lobby and the right wing extremist in Isreal who are jeopardizing the Israeli American alliance. Simply stated I do not want my son to die in a war created by Netanyau to support his radical agenda. If Israel strikes at Iran before the election to force Obama's hand their will be an anti Israeli firestorm in the US. The main casualty will be Isreali US relations which may never recover. Isrealis and their US lobby should not assume that a few fringe religious fanatics in the US speak for the majority of Americans	Most Americans do not want to go to war with Iran in support of a corrupt right wing Israeli government. Supporting Israel hurts because extremists and lobbyists are making the wrong decisions. If Israel strikes at Iran, there will be an anti-Israel firestorm in the U.S. A few religeous fanatics in the US don't speak for the majority of Americans.
6947973	The Israeli drumbeat of aggression against Iran is lunacy and the US would be insane to support them in that regard. All sides have said that sanctions are effective and Iran is no closer to going nuclear than Iraq was--that was the biggest fumble in US history. Netanayu had no intention of listening to any US suggestions that settlements were contrary to peace and it would be a waste of time to try to get him to back down.	The US would be insane to support the Israeli aggression toward Iran. Supporting Israel emboldens them to not listen to US suggestions.
6953215	Over the years, the Israelis have let us take their heat, committed espionage against, stolen our technology, and kept us in hot water with the Arab World. True the Israelis haven't slaughtered the Palestinians in mass. Instead they let them starve to death slowly, steal their land, and kill only a few innocents at time, which is even less humane. With friends like them we don't need enemies. Regressive Watch	Israel has spied on and stolen from America, and jeopardized their relations with the middle east. Israel is acting inhumane.
6948501	We don't have to guess what would happen to Jerusalem if it fell to Arab control. We already saw that when Jordan controlled East Jerusalem before 1967 - Jews were not allowed, and every single synagogue in East Jerusalem was destroyed - 58 in total.	If no support of Isreal, it will likely be destroyed like East Jerusalem.
6893364	That's where we've been heading and it's just going to get worse. Those of us who need to work for a living, and that's most of us, will be paying the bills and the rich and superrich will be collecting the rewards. And as for 'job creatiion', those will be the low-paying service jobs that the superrich so desire. More maids, nannies, horse-trainers, chauffeurs. Downton Abbey for the 21st Century. There will be riots in the streets ultimately and there should be. The lives they have in mind for us and our children will not be worth living. And when you have nothing left to lose you can start burning down the world you are forced to live in.	Without capital gains taxes, the working class will be shouldering the weight of the rich.
6892089	How about forgetting all this and only taxing money once. Maybe with a VAT. Why should money I ear be taxed, then the money already taxed is saved and get taxed on the earnings from the savings? Why is that fair.	It is not fair that the money I earn is taxed, and then the gains are taxed again.
6891806	I'm not well educated, and I have, as yet, to speak to anyone who pays a 13.9 percent federal tax on their income. Whats worse, to my thinking is that people I know well enough to ask aren't that interested that someone else does. That disinterest, as far as I can see, represents an attitude less of ambivalence, than the far more worrisome kind...resignation. As any investment, compared to any other investment, will likely reflect as much on means as intentions, it might serve to consider that a tax policy that fosters, for lack of a better word ...hording ..might just run counter to the thinking of those of us who think that economic development and refinement are to be preferred to, perhaps...oh... atavism.	Even not having a lot of education I can see that no one else pays so little on their income.
6897401	I think it's about time that we treat ALL INCOME the same. If an investment earns a yearly dividend, those earnings are new money (earnings) and should be treated the same as wages or the interest on my personal savings account or my certificate of deposit. To allow capital gains to be taxed at a lower rate than the few hundred dollars in interest on a senior's CD is to place a higher proportional burden on the retiree than on the multimillionaire who is currently running for President. I'm looking for fairness with this issue.	All income should be taxed the same. Dividends are earnings and should be treated the same as wages, interest, or CDs.
6896297	I make a modest wage, but because of being a life-long investor I have a good portfolio. About $40k of my income comes from my salary and $10k comes from investments. For that $40k I get up in the morning, drive to the office and work hard for eight hours every day. For that $10k in capital gains all I do is spend thirty seconds a month transferring money from my checking account to my mutual fund accounts. In my opinion it's offensive to tax money that rolls in with almost no effort at a lower rate than money you have to earn by hard work. Don't tell me that the rich work hard for their capital gains. I know how hard I work for mine and the answer is thirty seconds per month. Tax the lazy.	As long as the average person's hard-earned salary is taxed, money that's come by effortlessly -- such as capital gains -- should definitely be taxed.
6895964	But let's stop taxing reinvestment and the effects of inflation, which really are not gains. If someone sells stock A and uses all of the proceeds to buy stock B, the seller has reinvested. Why are we de-incentivizing reinvestment. If stock C appreciates only by an amount corresponding to the rate of inflation, it's also not a gain. The solution is to replace income taxes by sales taxes, with exemptions for necessities, no matter who purchases them. Then those who don't buy luxuries would pay no taxes at all.	Stop taxing reinvestment and the effects of inflation. We shouldn't stop people from reinvesting. There's no "gain" if stocks appreciate at the same rate that inflation grows.
6889926	There is also an another equity argument. Capital gains on asset held in retirement accounts are treated as regular income when taken out. Since middle income people will mostly have this form of capital gains they are being unfairly taxed since they do no receive preferential treatment, except for the deferral of those taxes until those gains are received.	Middle class people can only defer payment until they receive their capital gains.
6890090	It will not cause growth, because the $2 trillion currently held liquid and not invested suggests there is no improvement possible just by making more cash available but not used. It would certainly increase inequality. It might also restrain growth even further. Inequality also means lack of buying power, which is the reason the cash already available is not invested.	Stopping taxing capital gains won't cause growth. These taxes make things more equal. Taxing capital gains would restrict growth and buying power.
6902054	Eliminating tax on capital income would benefit me. However, I don't have a high income, nor do I make crucial contributions to domestic economic growth. All my spendable income is from interest, dividends, and capital gains. The total is about the reported median Adjusted Gross Income of Federal tax returns. (I have non-spendable taxable income due to converting money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.) I don't think it would be fair for me to pay no income tax while someone with the same amount of income from labor pays income tax. Count me among those who prefer a democracy that is economically non-optimal to a plutocracy that is economically optimal.	It is unfair to charge tax on labor and not on financial gains.
6899820	Is this some kind of joke? Tax capital gains as income. Period. Tax securities transactions too, most of all high frequency computerized front-running, and pay for national socialized medical care with it, like England does. We've tried trickle-down since Nixon and it hasn't worked once. Tax the rich. Jail the bankers.	Capital gains should be taxed like other income. The trickle down system has been in place for decades and has not worked so far.
6898911	Even tho I am not a farmer i see fertilizer when I see it. Capital gains is just wordsmithing for income which should have no special status. There should be no special status and be taxed at the going rate. Then Mitt will pay more then his help and perhaps more then a schoolteacher	Capital gains is just unspecified income. Capital gains should be taxed at the same rate as other income.
6897898	This article touches a nerve. For 40 years I've operated a tour company in Canada and ,on account of taxation, was in no hurray to grow the company.One accepts tax on income but when taxed 40% on the additional income that the original income may make, the incentive to expand dissipates.So if this represents the mind frame of a small number entrepreneurs, a lot of jobs, capital and opportunity is not being created.	Capital gains taxes discourage entrepreneurs from creating jobs, capital, and opportunities.
6897746	In spite of Republican whining, everybody needs Government. Somebody has got to pay, and it has to be the people who benefit from society, because there are no other sources. Bank interest is double taxed, and capital gains are and should be taxed. Contrary to the arguments that I see here, passive income is the most lethal of all to our social structure because it compounds wealth into the hands of a few lucky winners (sometimes just lucky enough to cheat), and deprives society, as a whole, of any chance to maintain a fair playing field for future generations. Capitalism is an amazing, but flawed human invention. Every once in a while capitalism and capitalists go awry. We are living in one of those times. We just need to fix that, and everything will be fine...........including the deficit.	Government is necessary, no matter what Republicans say. People who benefit most from society should pay more. Bank interest is taxed, and capital gains are rightfully taxed. Passive income helps too few people. Capitalism is good in some ways, but flawed.
6897586	All income should be taxed the same. It shouldn't matter how the money got there. I can imagine that capital gains might be adjusted for inflation. Still, charging 15% for capital gains, or less, as has been proposed, diminishes society's value of work. Work creates concrete economic growth, manipulating money doesn't. At worst it just creates more debt.	All income should be taxed the same, regardless of how it was obtained. Reducing capital gains taxes makes society value work less. Real work is more beneficial to the economy.
6896712	Hate to point out an obvious solution is to tie the tax rate to unemployment. If the unemloyment rate falls below 3% or 4% then lower the rate. At present, I would be looking at a 50% or better tax rate. I seem to recall statements when referencing the poor that they need to earn benefits. Well it would seem that corporate and the rich should need to earn their lower tax rate.	Corporations and the rich should have to earn their lower tax rate.
6896409	Thoughts: "I hope we shall take warning from the example and crush in it's [sic] birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws our country." Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to George Logan, Nov. 12th, 1816 ("the example" is England...) "History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments."-- James Madison "Money has no motherland. Financiers know no patriotism, no decency, only gain."-Napoleon	We need to crush corporations challenging governmental authority and laws. Capital gains tax prevents abuse by investors. Businessmen do not care about morality.
6896111	Mr Miron has not addressed the unintended consequences. This kind of untaxed capital gains will create a lot of speculation in the market and will eventually bring the market down. for what it is worth the short term versus capital gains at least has slowed some speculative activities. So actually adding a trading fee thats reasonable steep should be added if capital gains is reduced.	Without capital gains tax, the market would collapse.
6895135	Never let the facts get in the way of a good argument. How have the Bush tax cuts to capital gains benefited the economy? It has been proven time and again that the first Bush's tax increases started a business boom.	Bush Sr.'s tax plan was a positive for businesses.
6894918	How about this for a Room for Debate?--A yearly wealth tax of 0.05%, and a 100% inheritance tax? The 1% is too short-sighted to know economic fairness is in their own long-term best interest. We are on a greased path to plutonomy, and, within five or 10 years, at this rate, with the only acceptable policy choices being to give the 1% even more, there will be more and more social unrest.	The United States is on a path to plutonomy. In 5 to 10 years, continuing as we have, there will be more social unrest.
6895334	I could live with a flat 15% Federal tax on all income,with few deductions.Maybe add a flat 3% for state and be done with it.How can individuals and corporations plan for the long term,when politicians are constantly changing the tax code?I keep reading that 70% of the economy is consumer spending.We need more incentives for Americans to save and invest and spend less.Maybe more consumption taxes,like Europe,that are hard to evade and lower taxes on investment make sense.	The tax code is changing too much for capital gains taxes. Americans need to be inspired to save rather than spend.
6893308	This is more trickle-down economics. It didn't work before, and it won't work now. Corporations are awash in cash but they aren't creating jobs (and after all, corporations are people, right?). Giving corporations more cash isn't going to change that.	Taxing capital gains is a form of trickle-down economics. Not taxing capital gains did not work previously and it still won't. Corporations aren't using their flood of cash to create more jobs.
6893517	Sorry Mr. Miron, there is no evidence that low or no capital gains tax increases economic activity. It really is just a way to reward the wealthy, such as yourself. And the lost revenue will make it even more difficult for the government to provide services. The pesky poor and middle class are citizens too, not just the help.	Ending capital gains taxes rewards the wealthy and defunds government services.
6893177	The reasons given here for not taxing capital gains are pretty vague and unpersuasive. Frankly, I wonder why stock purchases shouldn't be taxed, just like all other purchases. The notion of creating a tax free zone for all stock transactions somehow seeks like a major welfare program for Wall Street.	Tax free stock transactions is welfare for Wall Street.
6892705	I can have all sorts of long and short term capital gains within my regular IRA and tax rates on them are bupkis until I either roll over money to a Roth or withdraw from my IRA - which money (including gains) is then taxed like regular income. Conversely, gains in a mature Roth IRA aren't taxed when I eventually draw down from that account. Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates. Interest earned on FDIC protected savings accounts of $250K or under (the account balance, NOT $250K in interest) should also be exempt, and above that fully taxable. This would protect middle class savers should they ever actually see interest beyond pennies in their accounts.	Capital gains, dividends, and interest held in retirement accounts should be protected, while outside IRAs and 401Ks should be taxed at regular income rates. We also should tax interest on FDIC protected savings accounts with less than $250,000 in them. Middle class savers would be protected if they could get past interest.
6892585	No, do not end capital gains tax. Limit capital gains treatment to the first $100,000. Everything about that is taxed as ordinary income. Then we don't need to raise the taxes on the ultra rich...they will simply have to pay the taxes they are supposed to be paying now. and we wouldn't have the Warren Buffets or Mitt Romneys paying 13% in taxes while the poor grunts who have to actually work for a living and barely scraping by are paying twice that percentage.	Tax as capital gains up to $100,000 then tax everything after it as income. Taxes for the rich would not have to be raised if they would simply be required to pay the taxes they should be paying now.
6892358	First, let's define capital gains. There are investments and there is gambling. 10-millisecond holding time is not investment and does not create jobs except for some overpaid Wall Street types. How about eliminating taxes on investments held for at least five years?	Capital gains need to be redefined so that there is not an unfair tax advantage for people that are using that tax deduction. 10-millisecond hold time is not an investment or create jobs other than Wall street.
6892035	The money has to come from somewhere. If capital gains are untaxed, that means that the income tax system will become extremely regressive, with the wealthiest Americans paying virtually no taxes, and/or another tax, such as a national sales tax (also regressive) would have to be implemented. Since this scenario takes a lot of dollars out of the pockets of average people who spend their income, demand would take a huge hit. How would that impact growth and job creation? Miron's proposal is, of course, just another permutation of supply side economics. It WILL be unfair, and it won't work.	Money must come from somewhere. if capital gains aren't taxed the wealthiest would pay next to no taxes or we would need a national sales tax which would cost the average person a lot of money.
6891432	I am surprised that the Times should give this crackpot idea so much space. Capital gains is the income of the rich. Are the rich supposed to be exempt from taxation? They depend on society to produce their riches. In late-Victorian Britain, the argument was the opposite. Non-work income was 'unearned income' and was taxed at a higher rate. And spare us the argument that low taxes on capital gains promotes economic growth. Under low capital gains tax (since the 1980s) growth was slower than in the post-war periods, when taxes were high. And virtually all the benefits of growth have gone to the rich.	Rich people use society to get rich and they should be taxed on their riches. Growt was slower under low capital gains tax.
6891924	We've given tax breaks to the wealthy for 30 years now, and the economic benefits that were supposed to have flowed from such breaks have not materialized. So how about something new? Eliminate taxes on wages and salaries, and raise them on capital gains. Then the people who actually buy the goods and services produced by businesses will have the money to plow back into the economy. The rising tide of workers should then lift all the boats of the capitalists, no?	Benefits that were supposed to trickle down as a result of giving tax breaks to the rich have not materialized. Instead raise them to eliminate taxes paid off wages.
6890097	The single largest source of capital for companies is the profits on the things they sell. The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries. The Cato institute deliberately neglects the historical record showing a vibrant Amercan economy when capital gains taxes were more than twice their current level. The Cato institute pretends that companies in the US are somehow capital starved rather than sitting on piles of cash and buying up stock at great rate.	The wealthy choose to live in America because we collect enough taxes to function as a society.. The wealthy can choose to live anywhere based on their own pertinent criteria. The American economy has been strong when capital gains taxes were twice as high. U.S. companies are already very wealthy and need no additional help.
3235996	This type of over-control can be harmful to a child. As a speech/language pathologist, I have seen children with stutters suffer anxiety and as a result worsen their speech due to demands placed on them by perfectionist parents. Also, children who cannot possibly measure up to the standard (such as children with autism, Down syndrome, etc.) can be ignored or treated with mental cruelty, causing them further problems.	Extreme parenting can be harmful to a child. Children's speech problems can worsen with anxiety due to stresses put on them by parents. Children who cannot measure up can be ignored or abused, which causes more problems.
3235492	Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child.	My daughter was simply lazy and not doing work, by cracking down I was able to get her to improve her grades. My experience with improving my daughter's life is a telling example.
3235302	For some. success is achieving things that makes their parents proud of them, and results in others looking up to them. But in some cases this is meeting the expectations of others, not necessarily oneself. People need to have the independence (from their parents) to develop a sense of who they are as individuals. I would argue that a mature individual achieves success when they do things that make them feel good about themselves (for example being a social worker rather than a neurosurgeon) regardless of what others think I am reminded of lyrics from the song Garden Party sung by the late singer Rick Nelson - "you can't please everyone so you've got to please yourself".	Extreme parenting leads to undeveloped people without a sense of self.
3235190	In all the essays here there is not one mention of raising a compassionate, kind, spiritually aware child. Ms. Chua can keep her horrible parenting style to herself. Her children may be able to play an instrument and get A, but what do they really contribute to our society as human beings and not heavily programmed robots?	Extreme parenting doesn't necessarily raise a compassionate child. While the children might be well trained, they are effectively robots who lack humanity when contributing to society.
3231362	The parenting Amy Chua is selling as Chinese is actually very common everywhere. I've seen many parents pushing their kids hard to take useless piano and violin lessons for reasons more connected with snobbery that the talent of the kid and I've seen people that parents pushed hard to become doctors or lawyers who at some point when they discovered that they are free adults that can make their own choices turned their backs at those careers and often at their parents. This is not Eastern philosophy, just an over controlling parent that is using her power over her kids to achieve goals for herself. Most shocking is her audacity to present her attitude as a way to follow.	Extreme parenting limits children's ability and desire to be autonomous. Parents are using kids to accomplish personal goals.
3282588	In my opinion, these discussions skirt around the obvious. Some of these practices that Ms. Chau engaged in are nothing short of child abuse, plain and simple. There is no question that structure and discipline are necessary components of childrearing, but to justify belittlement and punishments such as she describes, is to advocate abuse. She is lucky she was never reported to an abuse registry. Her parenting style is devoid of soul, and most likely will be replicated by her children upon the next generation. But what, in fact, have you truly created? Does this advance the cause of humanity...or robotics?	Some of these practices are nothing short of child abuse, plain and simple. When extreme parenting justifies belittlement and harsh punishment, it advocates abuse. Her parenting style lacks soul.
3244110	The "you have a short live, so enjoy" attitude alone did not lead to the Renaissance, the age of Enlightment, or the Industrial Revolution. It did not lead to the invention of the light bulb, or the telephone, or the internet, or the NYT electronic discussion board. Just "enjoying" life alone means you are enjoying the fruit of someone else's hard work.	Hedonistic values did not produce major innovations in history. Extreme parenting does lead to more success because hard work is necessary in order to succeed for oneself.
3236489	I am Jewish. I was raised by loving parents who wished me the best and allowed me to explore my desires. I had two Ph.D.'s by the age of 24. I have three children, one a MD-PhD, one a JD, and one a horse farmer. All did as they wished- I told them to do it well- Period. Life is too short for the helicopter parenting I see in my Asian colleagues. Be happy, eat dessert first, life will be over before you know it.	My parents are loving, and wish me the best. At 24, I had two Ph.D.'s, and my children have degree's as well. Life is too short for the parenting my Asian colleagues display.
3234604	My daughter, the salutatorian of her high school, answered my comment about how the children of the active PTA parents were receiving all the awards, and maybe some people would find that wrong, replied, "It just proves that parental involvement equals student achievement." When people asked her how come she and her brother and sister never got in trouble and did well in school, she said, "We weren't offered any other options." When I threw out the Nintendo because my mother became addicted to it, and I realized my children were more vulnerable, the neighbors were aghast. My oldest is a special education teacher with a Masters, my middle daughter is working at a museum at the same time as finishing up her Masters, and my son, who just graduated college is applying to schools for his Masters. Despite all the people who told me, "If you do that, your children won't be your friends," we are all fine. These people aren't my friends anymore, and I don't miss them a bit. Your job is to be the parent first, friendship between equal adults is the goal.	Parent involvement leads to greater success. Children are more likely to do well and avoid getting in trouble if they aren't given any other option. You are a parent first, because the goal is friendship between equal adults.
3234363	In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate.	Extreme parenting limits a child's ability to be independent. Some parts of strict parenting are healthy, like focusing on learning, goals, responsibility, and thinking of the future, but some are counterproductive. Children need to have social skills. Being able to live in a way consistent with one's talents and motivations makes people more successful. Forcing a poet to practice science does not produce a top notch scientist but fine tuning literary skills can make a great poet or literary artist.
3234040	I listened to the NPR Diane Rehm interview with Ms. Chua. She was asked if she would do anything differently now. She replied that she would give her daughters more choices. An example she gave was rather than have them (force them) play piano or violin, she would perhaps let them choose flute or cello. That is her idea of the meaning of choice. Very, very sad. All I can say is that I raised three independent, happy children despite never being involved in what instruments they chose to play, nor did I stand over them while they practiced. My youngest is now graduating in May with a degree in Aerospace AND Nuclear engineering! Nuf said!	It is possible to raise children without being overbearing.
3233929	I find the belief that children raised the Asian way will turn out to be dull and uncreative a little hard to believe. This is just one huge ethnocentric stereotype we are producing to counter the Chinese lady's ethnocentrism. In reality, the competence that Asians drill into their children has translated into remarkable commercial and technical success, and they have longstanding traditions in the arts that are also not much less creative than the stuff coming out of the US. So let's drone on about our great creativity while the Asians run circles around us.	Chinese children are more successful than American children.
3231965	Let's not forget that Amy Chua is a professor At Yale and that she can point that out to her children if they ever question her methods Having the street cred when it comes to imparting such strict discipline is pretty useful. Compare that to the run of the mill parent trying to be strict. Generally,there will be rebellion.	It usually leads to rebellion.
3230639	I am quite concerned that Chua's essay published in the Wall Street Journal only serves to reinforce and promote stereotypes not only of Asian parents and their children but also of American parents and their children. She presents her own personal experience as though it is reflective of all Asian families and negates the existence of individual differences within a culture. Morever, her extreme parenting style, with a decided emphasis on the child performing in ways to meet the parent's needs and expectations, negates the existence of a child as an individual separate from the parent.	It is concerning that Chua is promoting stereotypes of Asian and American parenting. The child is an individual and shouldn't be require to perform to meet the parents expectations.
9909711	Since Syria is a client of Iran, Iran is the mentor in the relationship, much like Russia mentors Iran. Iran most serious copncern is the United States and Israel desire to stop its nuclear development programs. Syria with its religious war is a diversion, especially if President Obama can be duped to believe that he is saving the world from Syrian atrocities, while what he does is take his eyes of the ball, the ball of Iranian nuclears. No, Iran cannot help the United States in Syria, its goal is to complete its nuclear program without hassle from the United States, and particularly from Israel	Iran is the mentor in the relationship with Syria. Iran is using the Syrian war as a diversion so the US doesn't notice them launching nukes. Iran's goal is to complete their nuclear program without the US and Irael.
9904624	This is one of the most intelligent articles I have read on Syria. Hoffman is right -- this is a civil war, and only the Syrians can resolve it. We need to stay out of this - it is not our concern.	This is a private civil war and should be left to Syrians to conclude it. This is none of the US business.
4801272	Government debts of more than GDP will never be paid back once faith is lost and interest creeps up. Without controlling their own currency and devaluing and inflating their way out of trouble Greece, Ireland and Portugal will default. The only questions: Who will end up holding the bill? Will Spain and Italy follow them?	If faith is lost interest rises and the Governmental dept will not be repaid. Their currency lost its value.
4802533	Optimism, please ! The sky is not falling as some predict. Papandreou has shrewdly realized he can can pressure Europe for a better deal. Thus in the end there's a bigger haircut and Greece remains in the Euro. Ditto for the others.	Papandreou will be able to get a good deal for Greece.
4803078	The readers of NYT should read the Economist. There the result of the bet the Greek are willing to take are explained clearly. If the Greek vote the Euro deal out they will face a much harder austerity package starting as of that moment. The gap between income and expenditure has to be bridged in one day. Anyone can imagine what that means. In spite of labor unions, politicized civil servants and the public opinion, massive lay offs, cuts of social benefits and salaries in the public sector, a paralyzed business community etc will result. But if they want that nobody can stop them. I would think it wise if Merkel and Sarkozy told Papandreou today in Cannes that the patience of the EU with Greece is immediately over and that they will propose to the other Euro countries that Greece leaves the Euro. It is a disgrace and an insult to the member heads of state what Papandreou has done. Greece will remember I hope. And the consequences will be dire, not only for the Greek I fear.	Greece should except the Euro deal and restructure their debt to hold the union together. The amount of income versus the amount spent has to be leveled out. Greece cannot support its own economy and is bringing the Euro down.
4801633	Containing the Greek fallout will not cure the systemic ills of this half baked-monetary union; half baked because it lacks a central economic authority which is politically impossible to achieve. Europe can buy up the debt of the tiny Greek economy but it can't save Italy or Spain. Moreover, if referendums on bailouts become the vogue the euro will go to hell in a hand basket sooner rather than later. Papandreou had no support for the austerity program and wisely sought to spread responsibility among all Greek political parties; whats to stop the unpopular Berlusconi from doing the same in Italy? Because the euro lacks a central authority the tendency of its members is to ride roughshod over democratic principles to contain crisis.	Keeping Greece together will not make all the down falls any better. Greece lacks the central economic authority to leave the Euro Zone. Europe can help Greek's economy, but not that of Italy or Spain.
20955319	If the USA Embassy is truly 100% constantly strong and unified in supporting Israel's right to exist, Israel's right to be a Jewish nation and Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital then yes and amen, stand bold and strong with the uncompromised rights of Israel. USA Embassy's throughout the world are in the capitols and this would be a show of consistent acceptance of Israel's capitol. I will require the tangible consistent defense, offence and support in action to ensure that the move has a righteous and powerful effect with no negative consequence having any ability to strike or take root. It is important to consider that if the USA Embassy is compromised behind closed doors then placing that compromise voice and stance within Jerusalem will bring about dishonor and disservice. I don't claim to be an expert, these are my prayerful thoughts on this topic. I believe that Reverend Robert Stearns speaks with wisdom, knowledge and insight. Above all may G-d's righteous holy will be done. -Reverend Tracie Plungis, NJ, USA	If the USA Embassy is 100% constantly strong, and unified in supporting Israel's right to exist. Israel's right to be a Jewish nation. Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital, then yes, stand bold and strong with the uncompromised rights of Israel. The US always places embassy's in the capitols, this would signify the US accepts Isreals capitol.
20920145	Why shouldn't the US Embassy be moved to Jerusalem especially when it's Israel's capital? As a matter of fact, just about every other country should follow this as well. There are already a number of government offices in Jerusalem not to mention a number of reference books that acknowledge it as Israel's capital. The only reason why none of the embassies were in Jerusalem originally was because it was supposed to be an international zone according to the partition plan by the UN.	Jerusalem is the political center of Israel and the right place for an embassy. There are already many government offices in Jerusalem, as it is the capital of Israel.
20919549	Israel does not have its embassy in Baltimore, New York or LA because the US states that its capital is Washington DC. We put our embassies in the capital cities which are designated by the country as its capital. Only Israel is denied the right to state its own capital city. Whether the Arabs like it or not, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that is where all embassies should be. Other countries don't get to pick and choose where they place their embassies. It belongs in the countries' capital. Other countries don't get to choose which city that is. It is where the country's own government places it. In Israel, that is Jerusalem. That is where all embassies belong even if the Arabs don't like it.	The U.S. Embassy should be in Jerusalem because it is the capital of Isreal. Other countries can't choose where their embassies are placed. Most countries aren't allowed to decide what city the US places it in. The US embassy should be in a nations capital, Israel's is Jerusalem.
20919514	To reward Bibi Netanyahu for his aggressive and hostile actions by such a move would be criminal. It would make the removal of the embassy back to Tel Aviv by Trump's successor send a message we wouldn't want to send, but would find unavoidable if peace were to be achieved.	We should not reward Bibi Netanyahu for being aggressive. Moving the embassy back to Tel Aviv could possibly evoke peace.
20919012	If one of the objectives is to protect the holy sites of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, it would be best to reinforce Israeli dominion over this area. Israel is the only stable, democratic force in the region with the assets to protect Jerusalem. So, regardless of the benefit(s) to the state of Israel, it is in the world's interests to have foreign embassies to Israel in Jerusalem rather than Tel Aviv.	If the objective is to protect holy sites, then Israel should secure this area. It is in the world's best interest to have embassies in Jerusalem.
20920593	Khalil's very reasoned argument is that Jerusalem could -- once again -- shine a powerful beacon of multi-faith coexistence. However, moving the embassy prematurely could knock the region and indeed the world's balance off. His argument seems pro-Israeli, pro-peace, pro-Palestinian and indeed pro-logic. It is a reasoned and tempered argument in an unseasonable and ill-tempered time.	Moving the embassy will though things off in the world.
20918837	I believe it will send a message to Palestine and the Muslim world that Israel will never agree to a two state decision and will lead to more war. Israel is illegally building settlements and should stop. We Americans also need to stop giving Israel our hard paid American tax money and use it in our country.	Moving the U.S. embassy will tell Muslims that Israel will never accept a two-state fix and more war will ensue. America needs to keep our money here and not in Israel.
20916758	I do not follow this logic, to capitulate to the demands of those that threaten violence. Sounds Chamberlain-esque to me. Jerusalem is the historic capital of Israel, the US is finally correct under the next administration to move the embassy to Jerusalem.	Jerusalem is the historic capital of Israel.
20914539	Just out of curiosity, are there any moves which either Israel of the US can take which won't result in Arab violence? In 2000, Israel made a peace proposal to the Palestinians, the Palestinians responded with...violence. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians responded with...violence. The author is correct, if the US moves its embassy to Jerusalem, a move which I don't see as either solving anything or wise at this time, it will result in Palestinian violence. You will have to excuse me if I think he needs a better argument against the idea since violence seems to be the Palestinians' default reaction to everything. This may explain why the Israelis don't want to put their cities in firing range by giving up the west bank in return for empty promises by either the UN, the US or the Palestinians.	This move will not solve anything and will lead to Palestinian violence. Violence seems to be the Palestinian reaction to everything.
20931674	The basic argument against moving the embassy to Israel's capital, where it obviously belongs, is that Arabs will react violently. This is a case of the tail wagging the dog. When we pander to threats of violence, in the long run we get more violence. The United States is the most powerful country in the world and used to be a moral force. It should do the right thing.	Arabs acting violently is the main argument against moving the embassy to the capital of Israel. The U.S. is a powerful former moral force, and it should do what is right.
20917193	Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem is a way to tell the Palestinians that compromise is necessary if they want an independent state. Ever since 1947, the Arab world has rejected an independent Palestinian state because it has not been willing to recognize facts on the ground and make necessary concessions. Never before in history has there been an independence movement that rejected a state of its own because of a boundary dispute. There are close to 500,000 Israeli Jews living in Maale Adumim and other areas around Jerusalem. Israel cannot move them away kicking and screaming--as it did with settlers in Gaza. The Arab world has to stop making statements like the Three No's of Khartoum, which happened in 1967, and the refusal of the generous agreement that Clinton negotiated at Taba in the last moments of his presidency. Moving the Embassy to Jerusalem will tell the Palestinians that they have to compromise.	Moving the Embassy may be necessary for the Palestinians to be independent. There are almost 500,000 Israeli Jews. If the embassy is moved to Jerusalem the Palestinians will know they need to compromise.
3649706	Our kids are addicted to screens: facebook, texting, video games, TV-- Their parents often work, and the evening is too often a time when each weary family member retreats to his or her screen of choice. Human interaction, the ability to deal with conflict, the necessity to adapt to people who are different from oneself, not responsive at the push of a button, and essential to the development of real social skills, becomes less and less for these kids--and for us adults, too. This lack manifests itself in a cut-off relationship with other people, indifference to neighbors, absence of the learning that generations have formerly passed on to the young--societal coldness and narcissism abound. And a terrible need to be heard, and seen, and cared for by real human beings is rampant among the young. This is Facebook's appeal; the young people are crying out, "See me! Here I am!" in a world that seems to want to farm them out to machines and programmed experiences. Money and technology are not substitutes for the love and recognition of real human beings, and for many students, teachers are their primary sources of those gifts.	Children already spend too much time on computers so online classes aren't the answer. In-person human interaction and the development of social skills are essential to the education process. Students benefit in life-enhancing ways from the connection with other human beings and teachers.
3647761	At this very moment I have access to a myriad to foreign language, mathematics, history, or programming courses that I can take in my free time and increase my knowledge of virtually any area of life I choose. Am I doing it? Absolutely not. Schooling involves so much more than simply logging on, watching a video or two and reading a few dozen pages of prepared materials. Learning involves interaction not only with students but with peers. By understanding where you stand among peers and listening to their interpretations of the subject, a person learns far more than the simple course material. They learn how to think, how to interact with peers and teachers, and to have some sense of the larger world. Home schooled children tend to test well but how many of them have gone on to really grow in a career? How many of them have a real understanding of what it means to be part of a group? Online resources are a wonderful supplement to traditional education but they will never hold a candle to the socialization that occurs in a classroom setting.	Interaction with both students and teachers is necessary for proper education. A person learns a lot through peer interactions and discussions. Online classes can help supplement classroom work but cannot replace it.
3647415	Well stated. This is the essence of what teaching is about, beyond basic preparation of material for the whole class. It's hard to understand why this isn't more obvious to people, especially educated people who have benefited from great teachers in their career. While online tools have much to offer to complement the learning experience when used well, the only reason to see them as a substitute for real teaching is as a major (low quality) cost savings for the masses. And a homogenization of education to serve the needs of big corporate providers of educational materials.	Educated people have benefited from great teachers in their career. Online classes can compliment classroom learning. Online courses should only be used as a low quality cost savings measure.
3651968	Just like other kind of learning, how it's designed and delivered and monitored and revised in response to inputs makes all the difference. Through an agency that provides tutors to school districts, I currently tutor children who are not making adequate progress. They use an online learning website that provides remedial content supposedly tailored to their individual needs but most of them hate it and they seem more like chimps typing than kids learning to me. I pull them off the computer every chance I can for small group learning with me leading the lesson, paper, and pencil.	Quality in online education, like all education, depends on the design and delivery. On line learning that  have seen is simple content that the children resent learning, it seems to me to be kindred to animals in labs.
3651071	An incredible amount of time can be lost to technical issues with online classes (and with computers in classrooms). The discussion board doesn't open, links are broken, my browser won't open this or that page, the teacher can't find the file, we can't submit our work because the files are too big, students can't figure out how to make/open/save files, printers run out of ink, presentations disappear, and on and on and ON. One of these semesters I want to do research to see if using computers really does save time in the classroom. I suspect that it's not as much time as everyone seems to think.	A lot of time is lost with computer technical troubles. Often there are technical problems in online education platforms.
3649836	Too many people see only what online learning is rather that what it can be, what it should be! The teacher is NOT eliminated but made more important in learning to learn. The computer adapts to the individual's knowledge and pace of learning. A few have tried to turn online learning into a way just to save money and missed out on the real benefits.	Teachers are not eliminated but made more important. A computer is able to adapt to individual learning pace and needs.
3648184	As a former computer teacher, I must endorse much if what was said here. All too often computer classes are nothing but a print textbook put onto a computer. They don't take advantage of the things possible with the computer and not a print text, and they take away the individual attention of a live teacher.	These online classes are all too often a book that has been digitized offering nothing else. Online classes take away the individual attention of a live teacher.
3648330	Yes, I agreed with Jennifer Salls' good opinion. Most young and older disabled students are struggling on their mathematic textbooks before all mathematic course onlines offer to help and teach some home-schooling, correspondence, private, public school, college and university students improve their knowledge skills well.	Online classes have helped students have better math skills.
3651490	When did having 75% of the students passing a course with a C or better become a good thing? I think that a 75% passing rate is not good. Did anyone work with these students to understand why only 75% of them passed? How much did the 75% who passed understand? Were they able to apply what they had been taught on line? I've taken online courses and they were not well designed, flexible, or conducive to having a discussion. This holds true for a set of courses I took 5 years ago and for several I've taken in the last year. Having an on line course available in conjunction with a live course would be great. Then the students can go over it to see what they've missed, ask questions if that doesn't help, and refer back to it when their notes aren't enough to recall the subject matter to mind. But exclusive reliance upon on line courses is foolish.	Somehow, society has decided that three quarters of students only barely passing is somehow a good thing. We need a higher passing rate than 75%. No one worked with these student to understand why they couldn't pass. I found online courses to not be well designed, flexible, or conducive to discussion. Students need access to a live class to ask questions and receive help to make sure they fully understand the material.
3649694	Sorry, machines are not people, in most work places new ideas, expressions of thoughts and sharing of information will lead to a solid work enviroment. Most teachers will tell you, ask a student how they got the answer? What led them to that solution? Where in the text, or what proceedures did you use to come to that conclusion? Machines don't do that, they just answer you as getting it right or wrong. Number one thing happening in India, where our President was quoted as "Out working our American Students" was the lack of cognitive thinking and reading comprehension. Meaning "They can't think for themselves!"	Machines do not provide the same services as human educators. Computers cannot give meaningful feedback, but only report correct or incorrect answers.
3649631	I am 40 years past middle school and am taking an online course in medical terminology. If I had to too much coursework this way, shoot me! I do a lot of repetitive exercises and am the mercy of the computer when it comes to grading. Computers often have one answer they're set up to screen for--forget possible alternatives. If I have a question, I have to email and wait for an answer. Plus, I get bored sitting in front of a screen. Then again, I'm not from the generation who willingly sits for hours playing video games. Give me a human teacher anytime!	Online classes can require a lot of repetitive exercises and leave the student at the mercy of the computer with regards to grading. Computers simplify answers too much, not allowing possible alternatives. I have to wait for an email if I have a question. I get bored sitting in front of a screen.
3648843	I would think it would depend on the individual student. My son and my grandson have both taken courses on-line and have done very well!! Perhaps as there are less distractions, working at their own pace and on a time when they are more receptive to learning. They might miss the interaction physically..but...the plus outweighs the minisus. AND they are not involved with less studious students who cause many distractions.	Family members of mine have taken online courses. Online classes offer less distractions, different paces, and more accessible times. Online classes will prevent students who cause distraction from interfering in the learning environment.
9418772	Unfortunately, young motherhood these days often means single motherhood. I wouldn't have minded having a child in my twenties, but there are few men in their twenties who want to get married, let alone have kids at that age. Even though this issue is always portrayed as "women are waiting to have children," men are waiting to have children too.	Most young mothers end up single mothers. Men are also waiting to have children.
9420409	Sounds like what Stephanie Coontz calls "two birds in a nest" raising a family - parents and children in one household, no one else around the ideal for the 1950's - is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund. The young should breed - they have good genes - but older family members should raise the children - they are more mature - and have the financial resources. Off topic - and I may be flamed for this - but what are all the C-section deliveries doing to our gene pool? Will women soon have pelvises as narrow as men - and no longer be capable at all of delivering a child - have we evolved to the point that most babies will have to be "cut out?	Young people should have children, but older family members should raise them.
9422393	I have been successful at both obtaining tenure, academic prestige and children (late, admittedly). The advice I might offer aspiring young women is to find a younger man who is not particularly ambitious or career-focused and who loves kids and homelife. If you find such a man you can reap the same career benefits as your male colleagues who might marry a marriage-minded younger woman. If you want to be successful it is best to pass over the highly decorated, high maintenance males, unless you have decided that kids are not wanted. I also think success and power are attractive to both men and women and that a high status female can find younger partners relatively easily.	I have been successful at becoming a mother at both a young age and at an older age.
9421189	As a single mother I adopted my nearly two year old daughter from China at 49 and three years later I brought home my son from China -- and he was nearly 13. Today he is one semester away from graduating college and she just had her Bat Mitzvah and is a rising eighth grader. Okay, so I am the oldest mom in her class -- in her school. Its not my fault. These are the children I was meant to have and I just had to wait for them to be available so I could bring them home. One of the best things about being an older parent -- one really doesn't care what others think.	If you wait until you are older to begin parenting you will not be bothered by others critiquing your parenting style.
9419294	Well, I can only offer this: My daughter and my daughter-in-law both had their first child at the age of 42 and they are two of the most delightful children you could imagine. I helped a bit financially, but their careers are fine.. I did have to make a rule that my wife and I absolutely would not baby sit more than seven days a week. Good luck!	My daughter and daughter in law both had their first child at 42, and the children turned out wonderfully.
9422820	In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living. In this scenario, there's no real need to have lots of children, parents can just have 1 (let's say) and be reasonably certain that that child will have a normal life. If it's OK to have just one child, then women feel that they don't need to start early. A woman in her late 30s can still bear that one child, so delayed motherhood makes perfect sense. In the past, women started early because they planned several children, and that in turn was caused by high mortality.	In today's Western world it is not necessary for parents to have more then one child since almost all children survive to adulthood. Women do not always want to start having children early especially if they only want one child. Women can still have at least one child if they wait. Before, women started earlier in life because they expected to have many more children and the mortality rate was much higher.
9422061	Delay living, that's today's mantra. Now and then I have the chance to give advice to the young, and mine always is to dive into marriage and family early. We had 3 kids by the time I graduated from college (on time, at 22). We had two more by 28. True, my wife delayed finishing college; she got her degree in 1975 at age 27 instead of 1970. My other advice to the young: don't decide how to live based on what professors, the magazines, and the newspapers say is the latest thing. It's your life, get cracking on it.	Young people should not rely on professors, magazines and newspapers when making major life decisions.
9416175	Maternal maturity is just as important as fertility when deciding when to have children. Very few women younger than age 25 have the maturity and necessary life experiences to become a mother at such a young age. At least in my opinion, the best time to become a Mom is somewhere between 25 and 35. The maturity is there, fertility is generally decent and chronic health problems have not yet set in.	It is just as important that a woman be mature as she be of fertile age. Motherhood requires maturity and life experiences, rarely acquired before age 25. Between the ages of 25 and 35 are the best years to have children.
9423431	It's sad the kind of pressure society puts on women. Their life goals and accomplishments should be tuned in with the random numbers people pick, 31, no 33 no 37!!! What? Where did you find this formula,???I'd like to know the equation... Having a kid is not a joke and it's irresponsable and simplistic to believe that women should get it done by a certain age or otherwise they are failures... How about finding a partner with long term potential to father a child, maturity, financial stability... Let's just get it checked off at x age because that's what the list says?? Medieval mentality, the rate limiting factor should be are you able to provide the love, attention and stability the child is going to need NOT HELP gotta get it done clock it's ticking. Conceiving it's a lot easier and may take just a few minutes, raising well a child a life ling comittment.	Women should make sure they are at a point in life where they can handle a child. Motherhood should not be based on a societal norm or time frame but when you can provide the best environment for the child.
9420423	Having had my kids when I was 35 and 37 and having spent the day of my 50th birthday enduring the full on meltdown of a thirteen year old I came to the conclusion that women should have their only or last child when they are no older than 32. That way when you turn 50 your only or youngest child will be 18 and it can be a watershed moment for both of you. I said this to my dentist once as she was saying that she wasn't quite ready to have a baby yet, and I told her that in the early years it doesn't matter in terms of your energy for running around the playground if you are 35 or 40, it's later on when it matters and I felt like after the appt she ran out of the room to run home and get pregnant. But truly, even if you can get pregnant later and have healthy babies, it is brutal dealing with teens when you are going through your own changes.	Women should time their pregnancys so the 18th birthday falls no later than their 50th birthday to share that milestone together. It's brutal dealing with teens, when you are going through your own changes.
9419321	So much of the debate focuses on when to give birth. Very little discussion addresses what happens next. I had my two children in my mid-thirties; quite the norm for professional women. Now I am in my fifties, dealing with teenagers who need me almost as much as an infant does-late nights, multiple crises, job interruptions, feeding, talking to, sturm und drang; as well as aging parents who also delayed childbirth till later in life. My husband's and my parents are older than most, more fragile, grappling with health issues, dementia, financial, housing, and end-of-life difficulties. They need every bit as much attention as our teenagers do. As do our careers, at peak. So which of these competing interests gets short- changed? There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish fervently I'd had my kids in my twenties. They'd be grown by now, and I could take at least one thing off my plate. I am tired. I'd love to be able to kick back and enjoy grand kids and nothing else.	Dealing with teens is the same as caring for an infant. Older parents are more fail and more sick when still trying to be active parents.
9419257	One thing that many young women may not realize is just how hard IVF is. I was very lucky that my IVF was mostly covered by insurance and that I got pregnant after a single round. But I was surprised by the toll that fertility treatments took on me personally and professionally. The shear number of clinic visits made the process highly time-consuming, and the side effects of the medications interfered with my ability to be productive at work. So if it feels inconvenient to balance children with work at a younger age, keep in mind that the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you will need fertility procedures that are inconvenient and career-impacting in of themselves... and that's all before the baby actually arrives!	Many young women don't realize the difficulties of IVF. Fertility treatments took a toll on me personally and professionally. By delaying motherhood until I was older I was forced to have more frequent clinic visits. I was also prescribed medication that had side effects that hindered my productivity at work. Longer wait times increase the probability of needing fertility procedures.
9417917	My wife and I married at 24. We waited and had our first son at 31. It took 5 years to have a second although we wanted our kids 2 years apart. We wanted a third, a daughter, but it did not happen and after 38 we were taking no chances. We watched at the play ground how mothers in their late teens and early 20's acted. The energy of the young mothers put us to shame. We waited for the usual economic reasons although my wife was looking at nursery furniture and prams at 26. My son was born 2 weeks after I was admitted to the NY Bar. Now I have two fine sons., 48 and 43. They are good, smart, funny and loving sons and arrow straight. Total product: one intelligent and beautiful grand daughter now entering college. I have lived a very long time and I don't have many regrets but the biggest regret is waiting too long to have children and maybe to have had 3 instead of 2. My wife so much wanted a daughter. A grand daughter helps. Yet we will not dance at her wedding and see her children.	Younger moms have much more energy. After choosing to have children later, she was limiting herself to only two. Delaying motherhood may cause in the inability to have children when you want them.
9417806	One of the saddest consequences of delaying children is the vanishing odds of seeing grandchildren, especially if there are several generations in a row that delayed, and the result is children that just do not have grandparents. I know such children, and they are sad. No amount of positive thinking and "there are all kinds of families" on the part of the parents can ease that pain. It's really disheartening listening to a kid tell you that, despite many uncles, aunts and cousins, they have "a small family", because they have no grandparents... How they wish they knew those grandparents, and wonder what they were like. Beyond covering the basics, money doesn't matter so much to kids, nor does status, nor material things nor travel, but what does matter to them is the people around them. There are all kinds of reasons to delay, but among the "know what you're doing if you delay" advice, I think the social circle a child is born into should take high priority - both in terms of the grandparents they may not have, and in terms of the parents who may not even live to see that child graduate from college...	The consequences of continued generations delaying having children is that children will be unlikely to have grandparents and vice versa. Kids wish to know their grandparents. The social circle that a child is born into is important, including living grandparents and parents.
9416238	The way I see it, it is better for people to have children later in life than sooner. From an evolutionary point of view, to be the child of parents that were in their 40s when they had you means that (a) both your parents survived until their 40s and (b) they were fertile too in their 40s. So, genetically, the offspring's chances to atteign - at least - that age and be also able to reproduce at that age are increased. Give it a couple of centuries of that policy and it could rise humanity's (at least in the western world) life expectancy by raising, among others, our reproductive expectancy.	Motherhood should be delayed because it will create children that can also reproduce late in life. Life expectancy can be increased by raising our reproductive expectancy.
15775042	Years ago ultimate was a destination for athletes from a variety of sports looking for something better. Apart from the fun of the sport, spirit of the game attracted athletes away from their roots in more conventional referee based sports. The sport has grown tremendously in the past 20 years and there are now legions of ultimate players the world over--competitive athletes--who identify as ultimate players. They practice hard, they travel to compete, they are committed to the sport through playing, coaching, and leadership. Having represented my university, my hometown, and my country at national and world championships, I am thrilled that American boys and girls now playing for their middle school or high school teams will soon be playing for USA on the greatest stage of all. Ultimate will restore and advance the Olympic spirit. And yes, observers to settle disputes that players cannot themselves immediately settle is the way to go.	The sport is growing and has many competitive athletes who practice hard and are committed. The sport will restore the spirit of the Olympics.
15769481	Frisbee is not going to be an olympic sport. All that they have done is recognized it as an international sport. Other sports in this category include ballroom dancing, bridge, chess, tug-of-war, and roller skating. If you want to know why frisbee will not be an olympic sport, watch professional ultimate on television. It's a great sport to play, but a lousy spectator sport. There's a reason that professional ultimate players are playing for $25/game.	Frisbee is not a sport. Legitimizing frisbee would open the door for other activities, that are not sports to be classified as sports. While it is fun when you are a player, there isn't enough to it to entertain an audience. Frisbee is not legitimate because pros make very little money.
8204520	Customs could be a better business for border towns than prisons ever were for other rural areas. That said, it looks as though the existing port of entry facilities are utterly inadequate for the volume of legitimate trade across the border.	The border facilities are not good enough for the amount of legitimate trade across the border.
8199353	This $18B is widely debunked as all expenses, not the Mexican border, start by subtracting Customs for example, for rational numbers. Besides in an era when we routinely overspend a few Bill per day or hour, what is $18B for border security, and we are turning people away, i say more money for more turnaways. The fantasy that employer sanctions is real, is the fantasy that out underground economy does not exist. To use our favored dug deal motif, if our purchasers of contraband, illegal labor, are the criminals, then the sellers are the greater criminals, sp stop illegal sales, of labor or drugs, at the border first. This employer focus is burden shifting and exonerates the offerors of illegal supplies. as well as being fantasy and employer-bashing.	The stated cost at borders does not include all  expenses. $18B is not much money when we already overspend.
6212507	I wonder if Mr. Krikorian has ever experienced any kind of affiliation to multiple groups. His view of dual citizenship is rather narrow minded. It limits citizenship to outward acts and ignores the true meaning of citizenry. A person is part of a country when he or she shares a culture with and is devoted to a country. Unlike marriage, devotion to a country is not an exclusive act. As the daughter of and American man and Israeli woman, I love both my countries equally, and would associate with both no matter my legal status.	A person should be part of a country he/she shares a culture. Being devoted to more than one country is completely possible.
6209065	I think we spend too much time thinking up ways to make life more difficult. I am an American citizen, as are my ancestors for many generations. I was married in Connecticut, and dutifully pay my taxes to the US every year. But because I married a foreign man, we've had to live overseas for two decades now. If you're going to require American citizens regardless of where they live to pay US taxes, but forbid them to live in the US, is it really fair to also forbid us to acquire dual citizenship from more accepting countries?	If citizens have to pay US taxes regardless of where they live, it is unfair to forbid them to acquire citizenship elsewhere.
6207424	Dual citizenship shows a hedged bet, a lack of commitment to the United States, as one of the turncoat, Harvard-educated Facebook billionaires demonstrated yesterday when the tax bill was coming due. This ex-American-Brazilian is now just Brazilian (not so bad) and living the high life in Singapore. Greed personified. Dual-nationals don't have a true allegiance to either country. I don't think the United States really needs anyone who wants to hedge their bet on American citizenship for any reason, but we especially do not need jerks to make billions here thanks to the United States and then skip town when the taxes come due. Once they renounce, do not let them back in.	Harvard billionaires have demonstrated that duel citizenship shows a lack of commitment to the United States. Dual citizens do not have true allegiance to either country and get away without paying taxes.
6207378	I keep two passports for a very good reason, there are many places I visit that require considerable sums for a visa for US citizens but not for a UK citizen, i.e. a purely financial reason. However, as a Brit I think the photo and Bachman's gesture probably sums up her attitude towards US democracy, but that is due to my retaining my British cultural roots.	Dual citizenship has financial benefits.
6206768	Citizenship as marriage seems a rather bizarre comparison, but even accepting that, analogy, the argument against dual citizenship fails. People can and do have more than one loyalty in their lives. Does my love for my spouse exclude that for a parent, or a child, or a sibling? Oversimplification is the fatal flaw of the extremists of both left and right.	People can and are loyal to multiple things.
6212259	India does not offer 'Dual Citizenship". It offers what is called "Overseas Citizen of India (OCI)" which amounts to lifetime unrestricted visa without expiration. OCI holders advantage is that they are not stopped at the exit point of the India's airport for proof of payment of income tax. OCI holders can not participate in any electoral process in India. They do not take oath of allegiance to Indian constitution when they become OCIs. They are not dual citizens in any sense. I am one of them. It allowed me to take care of my aging mother in India, and return to USA to spend time with grandchildren. There is no split loyalty.	Dual citizenship fits the needs of citizens with families across both countries.
6212065	I am a native born American. However, because my grandparents were born in Ireland I can apply for Irish citizenship through my mother. I have not done so but see no big deal in it, it would be more for sentimental purposes in my case. I love America but I have deep affection for Ireland. Having more than one passport does not mean a person does not love America, many naturalized citizens are more patriotic than native born ones. So while I see no big deal with Bachmann getting dual citizenship in general, due to her position and her constant patriotic drumbeating, it was rather myopic of her to do so at this time. By the way, I am a conservative person so this is not based on political bias, just honest observation.	A person can love America while having more than one passport.
6212708	I, too, qualify for Irish citizenship. The only problem I have with it is my shared experiences are American. I am more like italian catholic jewish indian bostonians houstonians than anyone in Ireland, though Ireland be the source of wit and stoicism, etc. When I traveled extensively, I felt it wrong to be 'Irish.' I do love things Irish- music, poetry etc--but I am American. Our citizenship is precious. So, is Irish citizenship. Apart from vanity, I had and have no reason to have the Irish passport, nor does Ms Bachmann, a would be President	There is no quantifiable reason to have dual citizenship.
6212698	How can a person with the intelectual maturity of Ms. Bachman have been a candidate for president of the U.S.? It seems that most who wrote about this subject have only U.S. citizenship and therefore do not live and feel what dual, or multiple citizenship, is all about. Can you love your mother, your wife, your daugher without feeling unfaithful or a traitor? I have dual citizenship and I know how I feel about both countries: The one where my parents and family lived and struggled, the one of my culture, my music, its poets and writers, its cuisine, its beautiful topography and so much more, but also with some very negative things and the reason why I left. And now I have the one that welcome me, that gave me an oportunity for a better life, for safety and secutiy, for multidimendional growth. Can any one of you give me a good reason why I should swear off either one? And if this is what you are thinking, I'll take take of the wounded on either side.	You can love multiple people at once, so you should be allowed to be a citizen of multiple nations. Dual citizenship allows one to enjoy the pros and cons of the home country and the country that is welcoming them.
6211707	I don't think she or her children should given up her Swiss Citizenship. God forbid, if there comes a time where her or her families health goes south, she would at least have an alternative, than to be at the mercy of the American Health insurance system that will turn her away, if her claim hurts their bottom line. While she may have campaigned against Obama/Romney care and helped watered it down, that its no where close to what it could have been, I would really relish her hypocrisy to be thrown into the face of those idiot supporters who rallied to her side against this administrations health care reform. While her family can take advantage of another countries socialist system, her supporters are stuck with crippling debt or the prospect of being denied life by the insurance companies.	The person in question should retain dual citizenship because if health problems arise, it would be best to go outside the U.S.
6210776	I was born in London my parents came to America at the age of 21 I was naturalized I chose to keep my British passport because it is my right. My parents are Irish born My father waited the required 7 yrs to become naturalized my mother never did. of course she has a SS# I can also claim Irish citizenship as well which I plan to do also hopefully in the near future	Dual citizenship should be allowed, as in the case of the author who has citizenship in America and Britain.
6210543	As a dual citizen of The United States and Bulgaria,i strongly feel that it is a benifit. I did not want to lose my allegiance to my mother country, however i also wanted to take advantage of all the wonderful oppertunities this country has to offer because they were not available to me back home. Its a privelage that should not be taken advantage of.	America has more opportunity, but people are still loyal to their homes.
6210349	Dual citizenship can be problem only during a declared war between the two countries. Declared wars (never mind our Constitution) are a thing of the past. Consequently, dual citizenship is not even a minor problem. I do not think we plan to declare war on anyone anytime soon. The last country that declared war on us was the one depicted in the Mouse that Roared (was this the title of a movie decades ago?) and it achieved what it was looking for: kind of Marshall plan financed by us. In other words, the whole issue is a joke.	Dual citizenship is only bad if a war is declared. Dual citizenship is not a problem not even a small one.
6209268	I have both an EU nation passport (recently acquired) and a US passport. Note that the EU nation was very happy to give me a passport and citizenship card at their NYC consular offices once the proper paperwork was done. Let me guess; everyone against dual citizenship is afraid of a) commies b) educated folks leaving the US c) educated folks STAYING in the US. You know, the old USSR had the same additude: "We're the best place in the world, and to prove it, we're going to force you to stay here." No thanks. Given that I will probably have no pension and no Social Security in the US, I very much like having the option of retiring to an assisted-living intentional community somewhere more enlightened.	With the way that retirement is heading in the US it is comforting to know that I have the option to retire in a country that will provide for me.
6209074	I hold dual citizenship as do two of my three American born children. One has a UK issued EU passport and the other an Irish one. Advantages ? Absolutely, not only for them but also for their children. And as for my motive in taking out US citizenship after 37 years here on a green card - very simple. I was trapped in Europe 9/11 and had an overwhelming need to go home, home being the US. That singular event and ensuing xenophobia clarified for me that the US was indeed my home, that I wanted to vote. On a lighter note, producing that EU passport at the dreaded Heathrow Airport a couple of weeks ago smoothed passage through that bottleneck! For my children, my dream is that they retain a link to their heritage from both sides of the pond, that they are citizens of the world, good ones at that.	Some people want children to be able to keep their heritage from both of their native countries.
6207021	Dual citizens are a big asset to any country, but especially to the US. Since US tax laws require all citizens (and also green-card holders) to report all their worldwide income and economic activity to the IRS every year, and pay US tax on any otherwise non-taxed items, any dual citizen, or green-card holder, who does not renounce his citizenship or green card, is actually a very dedicated and valuable citizen for the US to hold on to. Since the level of corruption available to taxpayers overseas is generally very much wider than in the US, dual citizens are exhibiting a very big commitment to the US when they hold onto their dual citizenship.	Dual citizens are an asset to any country, especially the US. Dual citizens pay their U.S. taxes and are therefore dedicated and valuable to the United States. Citizens with dual citizenship would be more loyal to the US because of the corruption of taxes overseas.
6335460	People are people. Whether they are good or bad (and we all are both at various points in time) has nothing to do with citizenship. Stupid argument. Travel more and the stupidity of this argument, and the ignorance it reflects, become all too apparent. So, my advice to Americans is, get a passport and see the world! It's not that scary - in fact, it's wonderful, as are the people who live in it! Stop being paranoid about the rest of the world. The damage that attitude causes for everyone is huge.	People are good or bad regardless of their citizenship. Get a passport. Dual citizenship not being allowed is only enforced by the paranoid.
6212644	My 4 children & I are all dual citizens of Canada & the US. It seems an ideal arrangement, as they & I balance the great opportunities in the US vs the great benefits (free health care, great affordable higher education, stable economy, banks, etc.) as well as opportunity in Canada. I & they can choose whichever course/country seems best. Meanwhile, we are each happy to support (with taxes) whichever country we are living in.	My children are dual citizens. The dual citizen can have the best of both countries. Dual citizens pay taxes to the country they live in.
6209107	as an immigrant in this country and naturalized citizen i favor the concept of multi-citizenship. however, for citizens who are in public office representing a constituent as congress person in federal government, that may cause a conflict of interest when situation arises, such as international conflict. where is their loyalty?	Multi-citizenship is favored by immigrants.
16707835	What is in it for Europe or the US to accept more Muslim immigrants, when all we gotten for our generosity has been terrorist acts and a truly astounding sense of ingratitude and entitlement? What is in it for us? And why is that not the first question that is asked?	Muslim refugees in the US and Europe have been ungrateful and entitled and have committed terrorist acts we shouldn't accept more of them.
16687564	Syrians are educated, kind, humble and beautiful people. It is the height of hypocrisy for the US to relentlessly bomb Syria and then slam the door in the face of war-weary Syrian refugees, all while boasting about being an opportunistic, strong and exceptional nation. Americans are yet again showing the world that they are hypocritical, selfish and merciless cowards. I'm surprised our allies haven't slammed the door in our faces yet. I sure would.	Syrians are civilized and beautiful.
16684150	Terrorism and immigration have become linked. Western countries welcome legal immigrants based on our tolerance of other religions and cultures. It is ironic that France has accepted countless numbers of Moslems from North Africa and the Mid- East, some of whom turn out, themselves, to be intolerant. No matter what immigrants' backgrounds are, they have to understand that the reason they have been allowed into their host country, in the first place, is that it is tolerant, and that it expects them to be so, too. This includes putting up with criticism of one's behavior, just as Charlie Hebdo made fun of what some Moslems were doing. (It does not include criticizing people for who they are.) Immigrants who will not teach tolerance to their children should be asked to leave. This should include community leaders and anyone who tries to teach/ preach intolerance to others.	Europe should allow all immigrants in.
16683867	Maybe if we heard from the other nations involved in this proxy war of sect and tribe within Islam - Saudi Arabia, Iran, other mideast players, we could take other actions. But for now, the deafening silence on the part of these players in the disaster that is the middle east indicate that all people entering the West from those countries should be suspect from a security standpoint, migrant, asylum seeker, or not. And that means finding out who, where and why these people are in Europe before any more are allowed and concurrently to deport those who are not valid asylum seekers.	Europe should shun refugees to validate invalid asylum seekers and protect national interests from terrorism.
16683572	We can not allow the refugees into Western countries. It's too risky. Any political leader who supports Syrian refugees coming into the U.S. should resign their position immediately if one of those refugee commits any act of violence in our country.	Refugees should not come into Western countries. There is too large a risk.
16683288	There are over a billion Muslims in the world. Exactly how many should be allowed to come to Europe and the US? And why is it the responsibility of such places to provide help from Muslims when they won't fight for their own homelands?	There are over a  billion Muslims in the world, too many for Europe to allow in.
16683096	I sincerely hope that Europe can learn from the mistakes the US made after 9/11. Al Qaeda pretty much won that round by correctly guessing the immense greed and lack of ethics of the Bush administration who whipped up public opinion to a fever pitch so they could get away with anything. They almost destroyed the world economy. If EU politicians allow public frenzy to mistreat their emigrant populations, Daesh will win. If EU politicians can come up with creative win-win solutions to mould a successful immigrant community, Europe will win.	Daesh will win if politicians allow public frenzy to mistreat emigrant populations. THe EU needs to figure out how to make a successful immigrant community and the EU will be winners.
16686483	This argument is pure nonsense and NY Times readers deserve better. Migrants coming from the safety of Turkey are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who refuse to come to France because they want to go to Germany are not in search of safer zones. Migrants who bully their way to their desired destination are not in search of safer zones. Please stop trying to shove this argument on readers. Just because you repeat it does not mean it becomes any more believable.	Migrants coming over are not looking for safer zones.
16685913	Should Europe shun Muslim refugees? Yes, but not only because of what happened in Paris! As much as these refugees are in a really bad situation - people seem to forget that there is already a huge problem in Europe with Muslim immigrants. For different reasons, these immigrants have not integrated into society, refuse to obey local laws and as a group are very hateful and intolerant towards others. You can either call me a racist or a realist - the facts are very hard to ignore. Anyone who thinks that these refugees will be different from those Muslims already in Europe is dreaming - allowing all these immigrants in will only worsen the existing situation in Europe. It is fine to want to help the refugees - how about the Arab countries in the region? I haven't actually seen any Arab countries offering help - or is that heresy?	Europe should shun refugees for more reasons than just the Paris Attacks. There is already a huge problem in Europe with Muslim immigrants. Immigrants haven't integrated and don't follow local laws. Allowing immigrants into Europe will worsen the situation.
16685520	Europeans are being told to continue supporting mass unchecked migration into their countries because the people coming, are fleeing the same type of terrorist attacks that some who are migrating, are now bringing into Europe....That's a paradox! Along the same nonsensical strategy, it's akin to telling Europeans to support mass unchecked migration into their countries from those fleeing the deadly Ebola virus. Unfortunately, radicalized Islamist's are akin to a virus that spreads and kills those who do not prescribe to their Ideology. For non Muslim Europeans there is no immunity, and the Paris attacks are likley just the beginning of this self imported virus.	Europeans are being encouraged to accept mass migration into their countries of people bringing with the the same type of terrorist attacks they are fleeing. This is the same as saying Europe shouldn't stop mass migration of people fleeing Ebola virus. Those who subscribe to the ideals of radical islam tend to spread their thoughts to others and bring them into their extreme ways. There are likely to be more attacks like the Paris attacks and Europeans aren't immune.
16685740	There is absolutely nothing we can do to stop the terrorists. They are less deadly than the pilots of the 9/11 attack (some 3000 Americans vs. 200 French) and the smart ones of 9/11 killed themselves. It is not clear yet whether the organizers of this attack are all dead or alive.	Terrorism can't be stopped.
16685682	Seems a bit silly, perhaps tongue in cheek. How to force people to fight who don't want to fight? Bottom line is that none of the people appearing in Europe and demanding asylum are refugees, since the Syrians all had places of refuge (Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.) and left those places of refuge as economic migrants (preferring German welfare to Turkish welfare, as would any rational human being). As for the non-Syrians, including various draft dodgers, they were not even refugees to start with.	The refugees are actually economic migrants. Refugees are in the situation by choice.
16684209	I agree with other posters here that it is ludicrous to even consider putting Western troops on the ground in Syria, when it's been reported that Syrian male refugees outnumber female refugees 5 to 1. Out of a projected 1 million expected migrants to Europe by the end of 2015, that could amount to a pretty large fighting force. Why do we have to continually sacrifice our own young people in other nations' wars? We're tired and spent, both morally and fiscally. Let the Islamic world deal with its totalitarian brethern, if it really desires to.	It is ridiculous to consider putting Western troops in Syria, and male Syrian refugees outnumber females 5 to 1. The current rate of migration could lead to a very large fighting force.
16683932	An interesting idea. But it seems to me that if these people wanted to fight ISIS they would have stayed in Syria and done so. The last time we armed insurgents in Afghanistan to fight the Russians we ended up with the Taliban. And what about all those coming from Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea etc.? What do we do with them?	The refugees just want peace. What would be done with refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea, and others?.
16682675	Excellent idea. However, I want to point out Times's blatant bias on this issue all year long, and for this 'room for debate' issue in particular. While the Times deemed it appropriate to ask a Muslim living in the UK to write on the issue (of course, pro migration) for the sake of journalistic integrity the Room for debate should have also hosted the point of view of a native European citizen from any country who opposes it. It has come to the point that the people with the most to loose and with all the rights, are pushed aside, their rights and opinions discarded.	Europe ought to shun refugees because the views of European citizens who oppose refugees is a valid view point. Refugees in Europe should be shunned because the European citizens needs are the ones that are being dismissed to help refugees.
16685190	The borders must be closed. PEople should be stopped from going there and coming from there or pretending to. Refugee intake must be radically reduced. We are playing with fire people. Europe will fall apart if this flood of angry people continues. The right will rise up. Europeans are seeing their cities destroyed.	People should not be able to go there. The number of refugees entering should be greatly downsized. Europe has faced enough problems, and does not need to invite more in. European cities will be destroyed if they allow angry refugees to continue to enter.
16683530	Obama says we are at war, and that this gives him the authority to do whatever he wants in Libya and Syria, as well as to fire up the wars again in Afghanistan and Iraq. If we are at war, then we are idiots to admit anyone from those countries.	It is foolish to admit anyone from countries we are at war with.
16685175	There is a simple reason that the EU should restrict the number of refugees, and it is the xenophobia of Europeans. I just don't think it is possible for Europe to absorb a large number of poor, dispossessed immigrants from a politically volatile part of the world without it leading inexorably to a rise in nationalism, and ethnic violence. This is not to say that Europe could not benefit greatly from an influx of immigrants ... it could. And it is not to say that Syrian refugees represent an outsized threat ... they probably don't. But as ISIS knows very well, all it takes is a few well-placed terrorist attacks to stoke the latent tribalism that lives just under the civilized veneer of Europe.	EU should restrict the number of refugees due to the terrorist threat. If Europe takes poor immigrants and refugees from volatile regions there will be more ethnic violence.
16681228	I would quibble with the metaphor, but nothing else in this article. I would say that pretending that the flood of refugees is the chief terrorist threat while ignoring the tens of thousands radicalized EU citizens is more like raising the height of the dyke while IGNORING the leaks...how cynical is it to seize on the fact that one of the dozens who planned and carried out the Paris atrocities was hidden in the refugee flow?	The refugees to the EU are not the source of radicalization that is already in place in Europe from radicalized citizens. One of the people responsible for the Paris incidents came in with the refugee flow.
7545952	Well said! Whenever I see an ad for The Bachelor, I die inside a little . . . and I say this as someone who has been guilty in the past of checking out an episode of some reality trainwreck or other.	Reality shows cause me to die a little whenever I see them advertised even though I have watched them at times.
7441792	I encourage everyone to read Jennifer Pozner's outstanding book on this subject, REALITY BITES BACK. I also respectfully disagree with the comment just above. In my view, it is VERY important that strong criticisms are raised regarding everything that is sexist, misogynistic, racist, and otherwise problematic about any and every element of both mass culture and elite culture. Saying "... why don't we stop watching it?" isn't enough.	Criticism needs to be strongly raised when a reality show is sexist, racist, or misogynistic.
7440879	Honey Boo Boo is not the only victim, women themselves are attacked or should I say I was attacked by a potential intimate for watching & commenting on the unraveling of Ev & Chad. The idea that low budget programming that reinforced racist, sexist stereotypes where the protagonists who are blissfully unaware of the role they are playing in their own downfall, while simultaneously driving public debate & advertising dollars, so media literacy not only needs to be taught in schools but it needs to provide the framework within which we watch Honey Boo Boo, Frankie & Nefe & Basketball Wives Kentucky or wherever Shaunie O'Neal takes her franchise next.	Media literacy needs to be taught in schools so consumers can recognize the framework of low budget programming that creates and maintains racist and sexist stereotypes.
7447002	I'm not sure somebody who uses the word "schadenfreude" can count themselves among the not snobby. Other than that, you're setting up a completely false assumption: "Their rejection implies that the people we see on reality shows are so embarrassing and uneducated and talentless that their stories are unfit to be broadcast on television. Why? Because their lives are unessential? " Um. No. Other than the fact that highly produced, scripted, and cultivated reality TV very often does not reflect anybody's real life at all, it is the viewers of the programs, not the participants, that wig me out. And last I checked, schadenfreude does not include being fascinated by STAGED misery, drama, or embarrassment. This is a type of twice-removed schadenfreude. It's really, really creepy. Finally - you don't have to be a snob or an elitist to think reality TV is a ridiculous waste of time, but YOU sure are tipping your hand by suggesting as much.	Reality shows fake misery, drama, and embarrassment and pretend as though it is real. Reality TV is  a waste of time.
7510053	Reality TV is Cheap Cheap , etc No actors with any talent , no scripts,no plots, no meaning just an appeal to the lowest common denominator of our society. I used to enjoy TV shows but now it just stinks Cheap-- I watch PBS where there seems to still be high quality shows with real actors, plots and scripts.	Reality tv does not contribute to society.
7484533	"Reality" shows ARE scripted - and the scripts bring even the skanks that "star" in them to a whole other level. PAY ATTENTION, AMERICA! They glorify the meanness and drama that is becoming so prevalent in our society - everyone who watches these shows is just encouraging even worse to come. They are all laughing at all of the viewers "all the way to the bank".	Reality shows are fictional, but they still produce stars. Shows glorify the meanness in society which encourages people to only make it worse.
9860673	When I went to college a decade ago, the priced i paid for a single dorm room was less than a shared off-campus room. I did live in an older building with communal bathrooms, my room was tiny with a bed, desk, dresser and a small closet. Not only that, it gave my parents peace of mind that people in my building were enrolled students, opposite gender friends aren't supposed to stay overnight and an RA on every floor. At night if I needed to go somewhere on campus and felt unsafe, I could call the university for someone to walk with me. Obviously it you cannot afford to live outside of your home, that's that but for people to claim off campus housing is cheaper and everyone does it is plain wrong.	My dorm room cost less than being a roommate off campus. If I needed to go somewhere on campus, felt unsafe, I could call the university for someone to walk with me.
9863424	The contributors and comments miss the boat on this topic. University has become very expensive and middle-class families should not be running up the bill by sending students away to school. The vast majority of Americans live within commuting distance of universities. People are saddling themselves with ridiculous amounts of debt in pursuit of a fantasy. They should stay home, work and save during the summer and graduate debt-free.	Middle class families should not be increasing the already expensive cost of tuition by sending their students away. Most Americans live near universities. Students should stay home, work, and save so they can graduate debt free.
9859903	Why no mention of the great communal living alternative, near-campus co-op housing? All the benefits of living in groups (diverse population and late night discussions included) and lower costs thanks to the residents taking on much of the upkeep of the building, cooking of the communal meals, etc. There are small co-op houses of under 20 and large ones with closer to 200 students. The best are part of co-op systems where the houses can benefit from economies of scale, residents are actually owners during their time at the house, and afford to hire some professional staff -- but students can have a good experience even with less-formalized independent group houses that are run co-operatively though they may technically be rental houses.	Living near campus in co-op housing offers the benefits of living in groups and lower costs. Residents are considered owners when they live off campus. Large group housing is available elsewhere where students can find a unique experience.
9863414	Ms. Shalala works in the corporate-university complex that is driving the cost of post-secondary education through the roof. No doubt, she's extremely well paid for promoting the on-campus life-style to gullible consumers. But why do the other contributors and comments miss the boat on this topic? University has become very expensive and middle-class families should not be running up the bill by sending students away to school. The vast majority of Americans live within commuting distance of universities. People are saddling themselves with ridiculous amounts of debt in pursuit of a fantasy. They should stay home, work and save during the summer and graduate debt-free.	The corporate university complex is driving the cost of postsecondary education through the roof. Middle class families shouldn't spend the money to send their kids away to school when University is so expensive. Most Americans live close enough to commute to a university. Living off campus will help with off ceding debt. Students should spend their college breaks working hard and saving money so they can graduate without any debt.
9853997	I agree wholeheartedly. It's true that I was in college a long time ago, but living in a dorm was mostly a great experience. And the parts that weren't great were good for my maturing process. As Dr. Shalala said, there's community in a dorm; I was a shy girl, but made friends easily in the dorm atmosphere. I would have been lonely off-campusin an apartment. Also, cooking, cleaning, shopping for food take time, time that I was able to devote to studying. Especially when I came back as a 26-yr old to live in a graduate dorm for a year, it was a huge relief to let someone else cook, and just show up to eat. And again, I made new friends, people I'd never have met had I lived in an apartment.	It is a great experience. There is a community made in the dorms. Living on campus affords students time to study that they would spend on cooking, cleaning, and shopping. I made friend with people living on campus I wouldn't have if I lived in an apartment.
9863387	The contributors and comments miss the boat on this topic. University has become very expensive and middle-class families should not be running up the bill by sending students away to school. The vast majority of Americans live within commuting distance of universities. People are saddling themselves with ridiculous amounts of debt in pursuit of a fantasy. They should stay home, work and save during the summer and graduate debt-free.	College is very expensive now, and middle class families incur a higher bill when sending their children away to school. Most Americans live within commuting distance of universities. Living on campus creates more debt trying to live the college dream. They can graduate debt-free if they live at home and work during the summer.
17193020	You're missing the point, dear. In the US, when Muslim women who are CHOOSING to cover with a hijab are being targeted with hate and violence, covering in solidarity supports their right to cover. This supports their right to own their hair. In no way can this even slightly support poisoning little girls.	Women have the right to cover their hair if they choose too.
17145000	I recall when 15 Muslim girls were burned to death in a fire in their school in Mecca. Saudi religious police (the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice) forced schoolgirls back into a blazing building because they were not wearing Islamic headscarves and black robes. This covering of Muslim women is an anachronistic, misogynistic relic of a Bronze Age patriarchal religion, one as idiotic and woman-hating as the other monotheistic patriarchal belief systems. A pox on all of them.	Hijabs are a disrespectful thing for women.
17141312	ISSI and other Islamist extremist have essentially appropriated head coverings and hijabs. It is a leading symbol of their ideology. As such, head coverings and hijabs are becoming symbols like the Swastika or Confederate flag. So even if a woman wears one in good faith, she risks supporting extremist ideology which is very anti-woman.	Extreme terror groups have taken the hijab as their own and changed the symbolism. Hijabs are symbols like the Swastika or confederate flag. Non-muslim women wearing a hijab inadvertently support an extreme belief that is against women.
17139038	I support efforts aimed at improved understanding and better relations between muslims and non-muslims. However, I do not support women wearing a hijab as it is a) A symbol of oppression of women, and b) It is a symbol of muslims not willing to adapt, adjust, and better conform to the norms of western society.	A symbol of oppression of women. Muslims should adapt to western culture.
17144780	When I see a woman wearing a headscarf in a clearly Muslim or Islamic style, I simply look away in what may be disgust. I refuse to have anything to do with people who willingly subjugate themselves to stupidity, their own or others, and I view the advertisement of this stupidity repulsive, period.	People who willingly subjugate themselves are stupid and I find them stupid and repulsive.
17141646	Why are Muslims always attempting to pretend they're victims? Try being a non-Muslim in a majority Muslim nation and you'll see some real victimization. It is not uncommon in such places for women to be forced into headscarves against their will. The last thing we need is that kind of behavior over here.	A non-Muslim in a majority Muslim nation will see real victimization.
17140140	I don't understand why a free women should curtail herself and wear an inconvenient headscarf out of solidarity. This reminds me of the Iranian 'revolution', where women did exactly that as a sign of solidarity for their headscarf wearing and mostly lesser educated combatants. We all know how this did backfire after the 'revolution' in 1979: there was no going back to not wearing scarfs.	Free women sacrifice part of their freedom by wearing a headscarf in solidarity with Muslim women.
17141534	I too prefer to dress modestly. But a person who is not Muslim and does not appear superficially to be Muslim who chooses to wear a headscarf is not at all in the same position or even temporarily living the experience of one who is Muslim and forced to do so. I don't see how wearing a headscarf as a non- Muslim does anything to improve the lives of Muslim women.	Non Muslim women can wear the hijab but it doesn't give them the true experience of what it is like to live as a Muslim woman. Wearing a headscarf when one is not Muslim is insulting to Muslim women.
17141178	Muddled thinking here. Muslims so often point out with alacrity that specific clothing (i.e., covering) is not defined in the Koran, yet here we are exposed to a Islamocentric defense of rules of female dress that are designed to restrict a woman's freedom. These public displays of religion, from yamakas to burkhas are offensive to those who hate religious tyranny, but, alas, must be tolerated. But don't tell me it's done for feminist reasons. There's nothing feminist at all about the three Abrahamic religions, which, together with their oppression of women, are used to justify so much violence today.	Wearing the hijab is a restriction of women's freedom so should not be supported. Public displays of religion make others uncomfortable. The Abrahamic religions are used to justify violence and oppress women.
17138252	No one voluntarily wears a headscarf when it is 100 degrees out. It is fear pure and simple, that has been drummed into Muslim heads since birth. It they don't fear they are killed. Get rid of this horrendous control of women.	The wearing of the hijab is not voluntary for Muslims. This control of women is horrendous.
17136757	I won't be wearing a head scarf in solidarity and I won't be wearing an Orthodox jewish woman's shetl or wig. Singling women out as temptation for men and forcing them to cover themselves with loose clothing, modest clothing and head covers is sexist. It perpetuates a world where women are sex objects and exist for men. Let the men walk around in burkas,wigs and hijabs. Women have spent enough centuries doing that. It's their turn.	Hijabs are a sexist garment and should not be used as a symbol for anything. This perpetuates the idea that women exist for men as sexual things to be owned.
17143651	What I find regrettable is that young women in their 20's would accept rules set up by old men currently holding power in the Muslim world and men who created those rules hundreds of years ago . How Pathetic that young women who should represent the future are protecting Idiotic laws from the past . The Quran says that married women should be discrete towards other men , it never said women should be covered from head to toes. We know the rules were set up to dominate women in Muslim countries , the same way other rules were set up in Christian countries to keep women at the lower end of society . I think of all those women in Muslim countries like in Saudi Arabia , trying to have the freedom to dress the way they want and at the same time women in western countries advocating for Scarfs on every Muslim women .	It fills me with regret that Muslim men are continuing to use hijabs to subjugate women as they have for hundreds of years. The Quran only says married women should be covered, not all women. Non muslims should not wear hijabs as they are used to dominate women.
17140726	Wearing a hijab for whatever reason - religious, aesthetics, solidarity is not by itself wrong and I fail to see why it is such a big issue. Because people wear crosses, yammuka or sarees covering their head with a dot on the forehead. The only problem I have is with the face being covered. If you can see my face, should'nt you be showing your face to me, too. It is just a mutual acceptance and acknowledgement of each other, in fact, just plain decency.	Wearing a hijab is just as acceptable as wearing any other religious symbol.
17140566	Women in Asia are being attacked for not wearing scarves. Women in the US are being attacked for wearing scarves. The way to show solidarity is to join the ones being attacked, which in the United States is to wear a scarf. In World War II Denmark, whatever a star of David means or doesn't mean, the Jews were saved by Danes wearing stars of David.	Solidarity is shown by showing sympathy to the person being endangered.
17140473	Asra Nomani and Hala Arafa pretty much sum it up, there isn't much else that can be said. the hijab is cool to those who see only the superficial, what is fashion, the 'look'. the reality is that the hijab is a handcuff worn on the head since there is no choice, no "self expression," and donning it symbolically indicates no thought. it carries the threat of pain or death for noncompliance. it is the man pointing a gun at your face saying, "don't make me do this."	A hijab should not be treated as a fashion statement.
17139581	I used to think the French were wrong to forbid hijabs in schools. But I am beginning to understand their position and agree with them. Muslims in Western countries must assimilate like everybody else. As long as they remain isolated they will be feared.	Muslims need to be assimilated.
17138267	I hope that Muslim women understand the symbolic meaning of covering one's hair before doing so. It objectifies women's hair (or face when it comes to wearing a burka). It asserts that men's sexual desires are uncontrollable and that women have to take responsibility for men remaining in control of themselves. Is that fair? It also degrades men. Why should women have to hide their hair or themselves completely (in the case of a burka) so that men can walk free.	It serves to further objectify women by hiding their hair or face. Non-Muslim women wearing hijabs reaffirms male dominance. It is also degrading to males. Women should not have to hide their hair or themselves so men can walk free.
17137131	I suspect that if Muslims were Caucasian the left, Academia and our beloved NY Times would not be taking the positions that they are. Its that insidious White Guilt tormenting the best and brightest among our western population. Failure to assimilate to the adopted home, wherever that may be, does in fact slow down acceptance into that culture. Are not the Amish and Hasidic communities still insulated and misunderstood after so many years?	White Guilt infects people in the west. If women don't begin to try to assimilate into their new culture, they have a slower acceptance to their new culture.
18007465	Had her hospital existed anywhere other than India it would have been forcibly closed down by the authorities as unsanitary, medically unsound and a scam. It is a scandal that a multi million dollar charity keep the poor and dying in such shameless and appalling conditions. Their deaths were mere spiritual entertainment to a grandiose Munchhouens complex	Mother Teresa's hospital was unsanitary, and not medically sound it should have been shut down. Her charities didn't raise people out of poverty, they remained impoverished. She had a Munchausen complex that made her use their deaths to aid in her spirituality.
18005097	Shame on you. It's so easy to second-guess other people's good work when you're sitting on your... laurels. I grew up in Kolkata in the 80s. Mother Teresa and her missionaries were active, and made a real difference in the slums in the central and northern parts of the city. More importantly, she drew attention to the plight of the homeless and dying in the city. I get that this makes some Bengali intellectuals, such as Aroup Chatterjee, uncomfortable. So what? So her priorities didn't agree with yours. Since when did your priorities become the yardstick for sainthood?	Mother Theresa was active and made a difference in the city. Mother Teresa was able to focus attention on homeless and dying so should be canonized.
18002807	The bizarre and totally ahistorical rush to canonize Mother Teresa is one of the more embarrassing episodes in the Catholic Church's recent history. (One of. There are lots.) The fact that her fame and reputation don't hold up under a light breeze makes it even more disgraceful.	The push to canonize Mother Teresa is an embarrassing episode in the Catholic Church's history. Mother Theresa's reputation is not great, so she shouldn't be canonized.
18143963	I am confused. I was under the impression she helped people who were suffering because they were ill and unable to help themselves because they were poor. I thought she fed them and provided help to cure their illnesses. Now it seems to me from these articles that she did not provide the help I thought she had. If this is true than she is no Saint.	I thought she helped people who were too ill or poor to help themselves. She did not provide the help I thought, and so she is not a Saint.
18006717	Someone who insists on using blunt needles on poor patients in order to save money while having millions in the back, can hardly be called a saint! Mother Teresa wallowed in the pain and suffering, mainly the pain and suffering of poor people - she thought it was good for them.	Mother Teresa mistreated the poor. Mother Teresa's work was more about indulging the pain and suffering of the poor for "their own good.".
18011686	"I will be honest, they learned very little about modern medicine in the Home for the Dying" True, that part. Because modern medicine absolutely opposes letting people suffer pain when pain relief is available. What Mother Theresa was teaching was flagrantly medically unethical.	Modern medicine does not allow letting people suffer when help is available. Mother Theresa was clearly unethical medically.
18003945	There are no nor will there ever be any saints nor angels on Earth. The greatest humans to live in the 20th Century Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King, Jr, were not Catholic let along saints. Dietrich Bonhoffer was Catholic. So were Isabella and Ferdinand. Alexander Hamilton, John Brown and Abraham Lincoln were not Catholics nor saints.	Saints and angels do not exist on Earth. Some of histories most notable and influential people were neither saints nor Catholic. Other notable historic figures were neither Catholic nor recognized as saints.
18007196	She did not even give the dying asprin, while converting them to Catholicism without their knowledge. She was willing to enhance the image of dictators and torturers in exchange for contributions to her order. None of that money was spent on mitigating the suffering of those who came to her. I cannot fathom how anybody could consider her to be saintly. Surely even a cynical Church could find somebody more worthy of sainthood. This canonization tells me that the Church has learned nothing from its time mired in scandal, and is still willing to try smoke and mirrors.	She didn't even give the dying aspirin, meanwhile converting them to Catholicism without their knowledge. She accepted contributions to her cause from dictators and torturers and in exchange enhanced their images. None of the money was used to help the suffering she worked to remedy.
18004737	She was just another Catholic con artist - pious talk and sinning and self indulgence behind the scenes. Let's hear again about her flying around the world first class. Let's hear again about all the tens of millions spent on bishop's residences. Let's hear again about the million paid to the Vatican by the widow of an Italian Mafia hood to have her husband buried next to a couple of popes. Wake up people!!	Mother Theresa was no a good person. Tens of millions were spent on bishop's residences.
18002061	Mother Teresa's canonization is being done within the framework of the Roman Catholic Church. I don't believe Vatican City is asking for the opinion of non-Catholics, atheists, agnostics, and followers of other religions. So, go ahead Catholic Church, canonize her. I'll spend my time worrying about other things.	It is the Roman Catholic Church's decision whether to canonize Mother Teresa. The Vatican is not considering the opinions of other religions.
19630583	I go online when I have either been given a new prescription or a diagnosis has been given. I have a pacemaker. My heart specialist gave me a full explanation and answered questions both before and after insertion. But I found a few sites that gave me information that was helpful, such as a little thing about sleeping on the side where the pacemaker was and how to do it comfortably. I have benign essential tremor. I've learned a vast amount about it from onsite articles, and the most helpful ones are those that give me pointers on how to deal with the increasing tremors over time. I like being able to access the internet about my health issues, and find I can talk with my doctors more intelligently and ask the right questions because I have used the internet.	Some medical websites can be helpful. Patients need info on conditions or symptoms they have such as tremors. Onsite medical articles are helpful and can allow patients to ask their doctors better questions.
19642659	I've correctly diagnosed myself and my relatives many times. My doctor has confirmed that I identified an obscure condition which she hadn't recognized. I have no idea why Dr. Swaminath is telling us not to google. It's incredibly useful to have this information at one's fingertips.	Websites allow for self-diagnoses. Medical websites can help patients identify obscure conditions. It is very nice to have the information easily available.
19641121	As a prescriber, one of my most common experiences is patients' declining to take a prescribed medication because they look up the side effects and get scared. Most of the time this is unreasonable and reflects prior, dare I say perverse, reluctance to try something that might help. So, to quote Paul Simon, a man (woman) hears what he (she) wants to hear and disregards the rest. So I spend extra time explaining myself, which gets tiresome.	Doctors have issues with patients refusing to take certain medications because they have looked up the side effects and are scared.
19640188	I had a rare, and very painful, rash over 10% of my body for about 2 years. It was misdiagnosed as a staph infection. Loads of antibiotics and only minor relief. I spent hours on webmd and discovered I had a rash associated with celiac disease. Told the my general physician and turns out I was right. No rash 10 days later.	My experience researching Celiac disease helped me get the care I needed.
19637475	I would imagine that there are also plenty of instances in which a little bit of Internet research winds up improving a person's condition or even saving a life. Twenty years ago when my dad got a weird spot on his arm, for example, he ignored it for months before being diagnosed with melanoma. Nowadays, a quick Google Image search on my mom's part could have convinced him to go much earlier. Doctors deal with people's health all day long and know a lot, but patients and their loved ones are the experts on what is normal for them and are the ones who know when something just doesn't seem right. It would be a shame if a patient failed to ask a question or do any research at all when presented with a diagnosis for fear of injuring his or her doctor's ego.	There are cases where internet research on medical websites improved condition or saved lives. A search on a medical site could get early treatment. The patients and their family know when there is something wrong even though doctors know a lot.
19634291	My doctor never talks to me except to tell me that procedure to have done next and what medication to take at what dose until I see him next. I would not know the slightest thing about my autoimmune illness if I had waited for Dr. In Real Life to tell me. I have learned some valuable things on the Internet. For example, my autoimmune illness can be triggered by estrogen and by vitamin E and by soy. My doctor kept telling me that it wasn't the fault of the high amount of soy in my diet that I got sick. Turned out he was wrong. I cut soy out of my diet completely and lo and behold, the test numbers that are the only thing my doctor ever pays attention to went down and he told me I could start cutting back on prednisone. If you've ever taken prednisone, then you understand that being told that you can STOP taking it is truly one of the greatest joys possible in this life. I never would have experienced that joy, I'd still be 40 pounds overweight, cranky and depressed on prednisone, if not for Dr. Internet.	I receive only the medical instructions from my doctor with no explanations or education. I wouldn't know about my illness without medical websites. The internet can help people with their issues.
19631678	Doctors, in my numerous recent experiences caring for myself and my family, don't often spend much time talking with patients, so I've had to look things up online. I'd rather talk to a doctor with appropriate expertise and knowledge of our specific details. But we get rushed out of the office, usually after a long wait in reception, with just a prescription-- or an appointment for tests or surgery-- in hand. I've found that veterinarians are much more willing to talk; vets have told me about complications to watch for, they've compassionately explained what to expect about the progression of disease and they've offered suggestions for how to cope with the inconvenience and indignities of aging and illness. I respect M.D.s and D.V.M.s-- but I think medical doctors can learn a lot from vets.	Due to doctors being rushed, I've had to seek answers for myself online because my doctor didn't have enough time to have a lengthy discussion with me.
19631099	I think if doctors spent more than 5-10 minutes in a room with a patient, the patient would feel more comfortable that the doctor understand their history and symptoms adequately. Doctors must remember that most patients have no idea if a fever or rash is a simple virus or meningitis. I have found sites like Mayo to be very helpful in figuring out when not to call a doctor for my kids for various normal symptoms. Of course it would be best to check every time, but you can't make a doctor's appointment for every twinge. On the other hand, the internet was very helpful in successfully diagnosing myself with cholestasis during pregnancy, and my doctor was extremely reluctant to order the tests and it turned out I had it quite severely. While I am not perfect, I have experience reading journals and understanding statistics. Other people may not be as aware or able to understand trustworthy vs. untrustworthy sites. There are many problems with the internet, but you can't combine limited access to doctor with 100% ownership of information of your patients bodies.	You can't go to the doctor for every little thing so websites help figure out when you need to call the doctor. Internet can help with diagnosis. Patients know their body, but have limited doctor access.
19647276	No, legitimate health sites do not recommend self treatment for anything other than self-limiting conditions - conditions that will go away without professional care. Common colds are examples, and legitimate sites will give you symptoms to help tell the difference between a cold and a more serious condition and will invariably say if these symptoms do not go away in a week or so, consult a doctor. We should not discourage use of legitimate health sites. What we should do is to encourage medical experts to review, monitor and give feedback to sites and tell consumers which are the best ones.	Responsible medical website provide only information on conditions that can be treated without a doctor. Legitimate medical websites help distinguish between minor and serious conditions and tell when to seek a doctor.
19645164	My family doctor was unsuccessful in treating my chronic anal fissure until I brought him an article from a medical journal published online about nifedipine cream. It turns out this treatment isn't in the normal database and has to be created by a compounding pharmacy. It finally cured my condition after months of suffering. Thank goodness for the internet.	I was able to use online information to assist my doctor in treating me. Sometimes treatments and conditions can be found that are not in typical medical databases.
19641659	I sincerely believe that I would have died many years ago had I not done my own homework, researched my doctors' counsel, and found their advice wanting. Just remember: In most cases, a doctor's compensation is based, essentially, on just one variable: The quality of forms submitted to third party payors, such as Blue Cross or Medicare. If the form looks alright, the doctor is paid, Whether you live, die, get better, don't get better or drop dead five minutes after you have exited the doctor's plush arrogant office, is really quite besides the point. Patients: Don't be so patient.	Not doing your own research can be hazardous to your health. Medical websites are healthful because it provides alternative views than just the doctor's.
19640046	Age 17, my son had intolerable stomach pain in the middle of the night. He visited web MD, concluded he might have appendicitis, woke me up at 2 AM, and suggested we go to the hospital for possible appendix issue. He is not a complainer, so I took him at his word. Result: appendix removed at 7 AM. I'm a believer.	Medical sites are useful in the middle of the night when offices are closed.
19639888	My Primary Care Physician says: "Don't google, that's why I'm here." But, sometimes he's not there, and so I see another physician in the clinic. And they may do something questionable for which I am grateful I can investigate using google.	My doctor tells me not to use these sights and talk to him but sometimes he isn't available to me and other physicians are not as helpful. Medical websites can be helpful but can also give a harmful diagnosis.
19636303	The very idea that it might be considered wrong to look up information speaks volume about the arrogance of doctors or the elite in general. There was a time when the Church was against translating the Bible. (you can't have access to that, you're too much of an idiot!) The matter of the fact is that doctors now have to do their homework and be prepared to answer tough questions. Excellent!	Doctors are arrogant if they think it's wrong to look up information. Doctors should be prepared to answer questions from patients.
19630660	I suppose that can happen, but honestly, I use these sites for much more mundane purposes, e.g., to determine whether I should see the doctor, find a home treatment for a minor ill, or learn more about something that a doctor didn't have time to explain. Occasionally, I have found a diagnosis that the doctor missed, and passed it on. But I think that most people get in trouble with these sites because they don't stick to the more reputable ones or try to play doctor without the knowledge and experience to do so.	Medical websites are useful for finding home remedies, additional research, and finding out whether a doctor visit is appropriate. I have discovered diagnoses online that the doctor missed.
19639960	When my husband was diagnosed with late stage, very aggressive prostate cancer 13 years ago, I did turn to the internet. I went to respected, reliable web sites. I got enough knowledge from them to help us choose a urologist as at least 2 of the 4 we interviewed, told us information that was just plain incorrect. They tried to sugar coat his disease when we needed facts. Finally, we found a doctor who listened to us and then told us what we needed to know. I basically avoid forums as they are full of the anecdotal gibberish of people who often are very uneducated but very opinionated. The only thing I ever learned on them was about a specialists at Columbia Presbyterian (we did see him) and how to travel with my percussion vest on small planes. My pulmonologist appreciates that I do know a great deal about my disease and that I know my body very well. I appreciate that he knows a great deal more about medicine than I do. Together, we keep me in pretty decent shape.	I turned to the internet when my husband was diagnosed with late stage aggressive prostate cancer 13 years ago. Medical websites help to keep doctors honest. It is good to be informed about your health.
19639295	The search for information on the internet about illness and symptoms may not only yield interesting info for the patient, but for the physician as well. I recently had an appointment with my physician and he began our encounter by asking me what I found when I googled my symptoms. I realized that this was brilliant on his part- not only did it give me the opportunity to run by him all of the fears I had concerning my symptoms but it also revealed to him symptoms and concerns I had that I might never have otherwise been raised during a more usual encounter. My internet search did not replace our give and take as patient and physician- it enhanced it.	The patient is able to learn and physicians can utilize medical websites as well. My physician asked me recently what information I had found online. By using information on the medical website, while conferring with my doctor I was able to get a more accurate diagnoses and alleviate personal fears. The internet can be supplementary to meeting with a physician.
19639089	I am a doctor and am at a distinct advantage in terms of understanding what my doctor is trying to tell me when I am a patient. I think that sometimes we, those of us who diagnose and treat, forget the kind of health literacy advantage we have when explaining diagnoses and conditions to our patients and forget that the routine diagnosis for us is not so routine for the patient being diagnosed. So, while Dr. Google and his message boards are not a substitute for my medical education, experience and expertise (and must always come with that disclaimer), he does serve a role in terms of patient education and helping one to cope that I may not be able to provide given the time limitations of my job.	Doctors and people who diagnose and treat should take their patients medical literacy into account when explaining diagnosis. Patient education via the internet is a good addition to doctor consultation.
19638956	When I was diagnosed with HER2 breast cancer, I did considerable research on the internet, most of it highly technical articles on HER2. I was lucky to have an oncologist who respected me and my knowledge and worked with me to define my treatment. I wouldn't go to a doctor who shows contempt for patients who do their own research. As many have noted doctors are neither gods nor all knowing, and I doubt any oncologist, even a specialist in breast cancer, has time to read well more than 700 technical articles on HER2 cancer. How would they find the time? It's ten years now since my surgery and I will be forever thankful for finding a doctor who had a true interest in his patients and was able to leave his ego out of the examination room. If you happen to read this, thanks Dr. Volm.	I was able to do considerable research on the cancer I was diagnosed with on my own, and my oncologist respected my knowledge and worked with me. It would be difficult to trust any doctor who discouraged patients from doing any of their own research. Doctors do not know everything. Even oncologists don't have the time to read all the research.
4441037	When I was in 6th grade, my teacher asked the class to identify the most important thing to learn in school. There were lots of suggestions - reading, math, history, how to write well, spelling, etc. It wasn't until someone said "to learn how to learn" that she was satisfied with the answer. I've never forgotten that lesson. One can quickly gather a lot of information on the internet, and I consider that to be a tremendous advance. But it takes critical thinking skills to turn that information into knowledge, to assess and weigh evidence, to draw well-reasoned conclusions and to present them persuasively. A well constructed research paper assignment can help hone those skills.	Gathering information on the internet is a big advance. A well written paper takes critical thinking skills.
4427835	Even an essay detailing a student's opinion on something must be well informed and researched. Besides being a tool for learning more in depth about a subject, a research paper teaches critical thinking skills. A good student should read and review relevant material if they are going to voice an opinion. Sure the internet makes it a bit easier to find information, but it is a double edged sword. Students must learn how to sort good sources from poor sources. They must learn to look at a writers or organizations credentials and decide if it is a qualified source. They need to ask questions about whether they think the writer's research or reporting is itself based on good evidence or whether their study was conducted well. There are plenty of resources available on the internet, but many would not be considered reliable by my professors at least. (For example, Wikipedia. I reference it in everyday life all the time for general information, but never for a research paper)	Research papers need to be well informed and researched, even for opinion pieces. Research papers teach thinking as well as depth in subject content. Students must learn to determine the quality of sources and research.
4427401	The research paper is integral to college work. It's the vehicle through which students are taught to gather and evaluate serious sources and THEN create a convincing argument or thesis to prove/demonstrate. But, teaching the process successfully requires close attention from the teacher. In teaching, I set up the process by requiring interim reports at each stage: bibliography, creation of the thesis; first draft, finished draft. At each stage, I graded and criticized. Obviously, most institutions do not afford the amount of time this takes so the process gets mangled. And most English professors avoid teaching freshman English/comp so the course does not get the senior attention it deserves. A pity, because the research paper is key in teaching the student how to do college work and how to write serious papers.	Research papers are very important to college work. Research papers teach students to gather and evaluate source material and create an argument or thesis. The students will need to learn how to perform college work and write a serious paper.
4426709	"It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used." Gottfried Liebniz I looked that up on the internet. It took about 15 seconds. Would it be more beneficial had I gone to the reference section of my library? It is worthy to spend one's time sorting, organizing, analyzing and synthesizing information, unworthy to just put in time.	The time spent sorting, organizing, analyzing and synthesizing information is worth it.
4428222	Google and Wikipedia may allow incompetent researchers to produce a flurry of activity and a work product that looks like a substitute for research. However, Google and Wikipedia are not the root cause of bad research or students who don't know how to research. A student who understands the fundamental principles of research will use various tools appropriately to reach project goals. One thing that strikes me: some people who object to the use of online tools seem to have a hazing agenda. In my opinion, if a student researches well without the long nights in the stacks, or uses intelligent online tools and techniques to narrow down the reading list, that is a good thing.	Learning to write research papers teaches important tools that can be used later in careers. A student researching by using tools and techniques they are learning something.
4425815	I can't believe this is a serious topic of debate. I am less than a decade out of college, and certainly had access to Google when I was writing research papers, but no quality college-level research paper can be done without consulting at least several thorough books. If anything, such research papers are more critical now than ever, because people of all ages (not just young people) tend to defer to Wikipedia and other such sites as conventional wisdom, when in fact they are often simplistic accounts of complicated questions.	I had access to Google when writing research papers less than 10 years ago. Good research papers will require students to access real books and information. Students need research papers now because they tend to rely on Wikipedia which doesn't go in depth.
4427039	As a high school teacher of English for the past thirty five years, I believe we still need to teach students to have ideas that are supported with factual information. Notice, I said factual information. It is sad in our world today when the supporters of finding real information, librarians, have been systematically cut from school budgets. Many librarians have crossed the bridge to finding legitimate information in the digital world as well as printed materials. Only, now that we need verification of information, do we find a shortage of personnel who can teach that skill.	Teachers still believe students need to use ideas and support them with facts.
4426679	I agree unreservedly. There is nothing better than a research paper to uncover superficial uncritical thinking. Students must learn to digest, isolate and critically (!) evaluate the relevant information and then apply it to achieve the objective of their research topic lest the result will be unusable garbage. There is far too much misinformation out there in cyberspace as is. It is stunning how our society in a few short years has descended to a level on which we seriously consider senatorial candidates who dabble in witchcraft. We should make sure that our future scholars, engineers and scientists don't get sucked into the same maelstrom where fact and fiction become indistinguishable or our economy, society and planet will become extinct in a hurry. The only truth in the universe is the laws of nature and nobody is beyond those laws, even if our politicians by and large believe they are.	Research papers uncover superficial uncritical thinking. Students must thoroughly process information to apply it towards their paper. Using digital research is grossly unreliable. Research papers ensure that scholars, engineers and scientists can distinguish between fact and fiction.
4426654	The thesis of the intro to this debate is that essays somehow free up students' thinking while the rigidity of term papers is stultifying. It's been a long time since high school and college, but I believe that all term papers begin with a thesis, much like this debate did. And the goal of a term paper is to rigorously examine all evidence supporting and conflicting with that thesis to test its validity. An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.	This debate assumes term papers are stultifying while essays allow free thinking. When I was in high school term papers began with a thesis as do debates. Term papers teach to research and see both sides of a topic in order to test the truth in the theory. Research papers are a useful tool for students learning how to process information and understand a topic.
4426345	Actually the internest stands to make research even greater in depth more available to all on any given subject. Academic study, any research paper done today has international data avilable like never before. The internet is full of terrible information as well, undocumented, unproven and unreliable. However if used right one can learn as much with a computer and the internet as any university can teach. I have educated myself with the internet on a number of subjects I am interested in and can answer off the cuff questions regarding any of those given subjects with direct factual answers without rhetoric. If only all Americans felt the same urge to learn we as a nation would be in much better condition. ignorance is not bliss, it's anger, depression and a feeling of hopelessness Thomas McMahon Millis Ma	The internet makes in-depth research more openly available on any subject. Any papers done today will have access to more data than they ever did before. The internet is full of undocumented and unreliable information. Students can learn just as much with the internet.
4425625	I personally think that using arguments and evidence is central in any debate. However the nature of research changed with the advent of databases and google. Moreover the Internet has dramatically changed the way people discuss or just get information about public issues. Perhaps, it would be more helpful to teach students how to deal with digital tools more consciously. For example, when I was a TA, my supervisor gave to his undergraduate students a very original assignment: writing a wikipedia entry. Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality.	Research papers encourage students to properly support their arguments. After Google and databases became common place, the very nature of research papers was changed. Teaching students in the use of digital tools would be helpful.
4425252	"Are research papers a waste of time?" Absolutely not! The internet may give students and scholars easy access to sources, but many of these sources are flawed or unreliable in some way. Now more than ever, students need to know how to sift through information to find reliable sources and well-constructed arguments. Writing a research paper is still the best way to do this. Select a paper topic that you find interesting or important. Read and evaluate 10-15 reputable sources related to your topic, and then build an argument that engages with and contributes to this existing research. This might not be the most exciting assignment in the world (depends on the topic, I suppose) but it teaches skills that every college graduate should have. Really, every high school graduate ought to have this training as well. But let's not ask for the moon!	The internet gives easy access to sources, but many are flawed or unreliable. Writing research papers helps students to learn how to make valid arguments and find reliable sources which is important in today's information society. Research papers may not be exciting assignments, but they are important. Research papers are quite useful in the skills that teach and they are skills every graduate should have.
18248741	I enjoy reading the comments and usually learn as much or more so from the comments than from the article itself. Many of the comments are thoughtfully written and provider greater insight into the issue at hand. It would be a shame to eliminate the comments section in its entirety because of a few bad apples.	I enjoy reading the comments, usually I learn as much or more from the comments, than the article. Many comments are thoughful and insightful. Comments sections should not be eliminated because of just a few cases of misuse.
18247680	The comments can "improve the quality of work as writers learn more about their readers..." But not David Brooks who has admitted that he cannot deal with his readers' comments. There is a "Gresham Law" that applies to comment sections of various media whereby, over time, low quality or offensive comments drive away high quality commentators unless the media works hard to protect the quality of their comment section. The NYT is one of the few that successfully does it. The majority of comment sections deteriorate into the equivalent of debased currencies.	David Brooks can not deal with the comments of his readers. Offensive and low quality comments make high quality commentators leave if the website doesn't work to protect their comments section. Comments sections become illegitimized by inappropriate commenters.
18247581	I seldom read any column or analysis that does not allow comments. I join the others who say they often get more info and insight from the comments than the original piece. Moderating, at this stage in publishing, seems essential to diminish the troll effect. I would suggest a stated policy of allowing only one or two comments per article would also help. One need only go to WaPo to see why. Most comments sections contain over 1,000 posts and are filled with individuals posting scores of comments. Another idea would be to increase moderating and charge a higher subscription rate for the privilege of commenting. One could continue to allow all to read the comments, just charge for writing them. I would be willing to pay a few bucks a month more.	Comment sections provide insight.
18256373	I hope this discussion isn;t some trial balloon to gauge public feeling about shutting down the comments section. There are sites where the comments are often crass, personal, ad hominem, abusive and so forth both to the author of the piece and other commenters, but I haven't found this to be true of the NYT, probably in part because of the staff that does the moderating. So, if you need a vote, consider this a vote in favor of continuation of a policy of allowing readers' comments. At least that way you know there's a world out there and someone is hearing the tree fall in the forest.	Moderated comment sections, such as those in the New York Times, are free of the typical abuse and invective often found elsewhere. Comment sections create a connection to the world and others' observations.
18248396	When publications allow totally anonymous comments, chaos follows. One gets the feeling that comments are posted by dirty old men in the basement, or 14-year-old dropouts. The NY Times does it right, despite some obvious flaws, such as rewarding quick posting regulars who often set the tone for subsequent commentary. Yet on issues such as North Carolina's egregious HB2, comments from around the world are illuminating and revealing, which adds context, flavor and perspective to the original article. That's a good thing.	When there are no moderators and commentators are anonymous, they tend to abuse the privileged of commenting.
18247485	I prefer to know how many people are responding to a Times article in a manner that would please Nazi's and racists and homophobes. I prefer to know why they think such horrifying things, and how deeply they feel about it. And I really appreciate seeing how people hasten to tell them they are seriously wrong. I don't feel that I am in any danger of absorbing horrific ideas simply by hearing them. I would call that a bogus social theory. The converse of the idea that social engineering of permissible ideas is a good thing, is that people respond better if only exposed to approved ideas. That's just as bad.	It is good to know how many people have intolerant responses to articles. Comment sections reveal important insights into people's thoughts and abuse can be countered by other comments. I don't think I absorb horrible ideas by reading them. Comments allow all views to be heard.
18246850	The problem that I'm having at this moment is that there is a saying, "those that control the vote controls the election." The same thing thing can apply to a blog like Paul K. and the NYT, who has endorsed HC. Are thumbs up or down being controlled in favored of the person that they have endorsed? Are comments being generated in favor in the person that they have endorsed? I'v been reading PK and the NYT since the start of Berrnie Sanders run for POTUS and most of it posting was for BS with thumbs up ranging from 200 to 500 thumbs up. Then a couple weeks ago a almost complete shift from BS to HC, with HC thumbs up in the hundreds? Maybe it's just me, but it appears the comments are being manufactured lately in HC favor? So, if you control the vote,you control the election, and if you control the blog and the comment section more than likely you control the final thought process .	Comments and "thumbs up" could be generated in favor of the person endorsed by the article. The comments section cannot be trusted. The comments are in being manufactured in favor of HC to control the election. Controlling blogs and comment sections control the final though process.
18246663	I comment reasonably frequently and also read a lot more than I would otherwise because of the comments. Mostly I feel the Times does a decent job moderating the comments, although I often notice the same pro-Hillary bias in many of the NYT picks as opposed to the Reader's Picks. (Anecdotally, this bias in the picks seems to be diminishing.) I also agree that many commenters are predictable, but because of their status, make it to the front of the line. I wonder if more courageous columnists might be willing to directly take on points that commenters raise. I feel that there is an awful lot of repetition of memes by columnists that have been discredited, such as Sanders's supposed pro-gun positions, when in fact he has a D minus rating from the NRA. Often it is commenters who bring these up, and columnists never address them. While I know you can't write a column by committee, I think a columnist that occasionally addressed specific, thoughtful reactions to his/her columns could bring in a lot of readers, and make readers feel they are listened to by the Times.	I have read more than I would have if I hadn't been reading the comments. Comment sections can bring in more readers if the author addressed different reactions to columns.
18242693	As a former psychologist and career counselor, I am interested in encouraging forms of expression that reinforce good mental health. On line commenting has been over taken, sabotaged, and abused with a high percentage of mentally unhealthy abusive speech. This one negative aspect is significant enough to justify abolishing commenting. This unhealthy behavior does not serve as a safety valve but rather encourages self destructive ruminating that can explode in violence. Time to bite the bullet and give up on both moderated and unmoderated online comments!	People cannot have educated debates, rather they name call and insult in comment sections. Comment sections can incite violence rather than serving as a healthy release.
18240881	I find the comment section indispensable especially when reading an opinion piece in culling the purported facts with other website links, pointing out sloppy reasoning or offering an alternative opinion. Sometimes an article is not complete without the comment section, it is an alternate universe of editors, and though this maybe disconcerting for the authors, I have to imagine it makes them better journalists and writers.	While reading the comment sections postings I find alternative opinion and fixes to incorrectly reported facts from the original article. Comment sections complete incomplete articles even if the authors don't agree, it makes them better journalists.
18258937	Foreign agents may use the comments section to make it appear that the American public has opinions that are favorable to the foreign country they represent. I believe this was particularly true for comments on articles about Ukraine and the Russian backed separatists. It seemed to me that many commenters and those who recommended their comments were RT writers or Kremlinbots using pseudonyms.	Comments sections can be used by foreign agents to skew the appearance of public option.
18250883	Sorry, I'd feel uneasy if I had to use my real name for EVERYTHING online. People could find me fairly easily, maybe even track me down at work. Besides, I kind of like using a name online that doesn't indicate whether I'm male or female. Thanks to good moderating, we can have useful and interesting discussions on here.	I like being able to use a name that does not indicate gender. With good moderation, useful and interesting discussions can be had.
18249925	The quality of reporting and the general knowledge of writers and editors has markedly decreased in the past 30 years. Many of the commentators are more intelligent and knowledgeable than the beat reporters and the columnists. Of course, many comments are of low quality and often historically ignorant but that is more than compensated for by the ones that are of very high quality. Democracy needs a comments section.	There is a marked decrease in the general reporting of writers over the last 30 years. The commentators are often more knowledgeable than the journalists. Comments section enable the democratic discussion of ideas.
18249267	The Internet would be a vastly different place if we could somehow do away with anonymity. But would it actually be a better place? In our very polarized world, many people are understandably reluctant to speak out on controversial issues, unless they can do so anonymously. If we want to know what people really think, we need to let them speak anonymously. So long as there has been written communication, people have had that ability, and maybe that right. Before that, people threw rocks under cover of darkness to get their point across. I understand the temptation to demand that people use their real identities, but it seems almost impossible to do in the real world. Even if you ask for a scan of my driver's license, you can't be sure it is really my license, or be sure that it has not been altered.	People are more likely to speak up if they can do so anonymously. Although it might be good to have commenters reveal their true identities, it is impossible to enforce.
18248824	i assume the 'microbio' declares my background and competence and avoids unpleasantries known to have occurred to others in the current highly polarized environment. One's argument , if it has merit, should be more important than the name of the person who wrote it. I understand that well thought out ideas and even humor will be remembered longer than a rant and trust the NYT editors will view those with lasting value favorably in their posting decisions.	Arguments within the comment section are more important than the name of the authors. Intellectual ideas will be remembered longer than angry attacks in comments section.
18248041	The NYT monitors its comments and avoids the problem. Not all media outlets are in a position to do this. I find the comments useful and interesting as a gauge of how NYT folks are responding to the various ideas found on its pages.	They moniter their comments. The comment sections help me get an idea of how others feel about the articles.
18247674	Mr. Wolf sounds as if he would have castigated Mark Twain, and George Sand for using pseudonyms. The fictitious nom de plume is an old and venerable way for writers to express themselves. The actual solution is the one the New York Times employs. Editing irrational or vitriolic commentary, rather than publishing everything, afraid of offending a subscriber here and there if they don't. Instead of threatening to throw out the baby with the bathwater as an alternative, or subjecting the commentariat to TSA type scrutiny before allowing our opinions to be published.	Commentary offers an alternative to all opinions that cannot be published in the commentary.
18247268	A great idea that I have implemented in my own case over 5 or more years of commenting. Have I been called names? So what? I agree that it might be wise to permit exceptions. But I fear the exceptions would quickly begin to swallow the rule. I take anonymous comments less seriously than ones that disclose the poster's name -- though, granted, it is not always easy to tell them apart.	Comment sections are an important place for discussion even if some posters abuse them.
18247207	There may be unpleasant racial and sexual truths. If they are repugnant, that is all the more reason to express them. That one doesn't like hearing a particular truth is probably a good reason to think one needs to hear it and learn from it, not that it should be suppressed as dangerous information.	It is good to express opinions even if repugnant. Comment sections provide a place for people to hear opinions other than their own and learn, without suppressing them.
18246796	Obviously i am not using my legal name. I only comment on the NY Times which supposedly is moderated. I did at one time use my real name with no problems. One day, however, a man said "I would like to break your arm" in response to my comment. How that comment slipped through i have no idea. I decided it would be smart to drop my name and start over. There are enough nuts out there as it is and i don't want to be hassled online or even receive a visitor who wanted to "deal with me." I live alone and i just feel better doing this. Besides, i kind of like my "new" name.	In the past I safely used my real name. Comment sections provide an avenue for unwanted hassle and even interaction with so-called "nuts.".
18246562	I wonder of what use my comments would be without that I stood by them. Do I honestly have any crucial wisdom to impart upon the world that would be of such benefit that even doing so anonymously would be of service to the community? Or does it just make me feel good to spew? But truthfully - the reaction given by the readership here - anonymous or not - has got to be a reasonable barometer of the feelings of the community, whether or not an individual feels comfortable posting as a person, or only as a glyph. And there is value in that for us all.	Comment sections give value by showing the feelings of the community.
18242311	I would actually repeat any comment I have made online in person- and I have some very harsh critical opinions- but it is impossible to have a critical comment on a subject without someone being offended and flagging the comment and having it removed- for example ANY criticism towards Israel or zionism is immediately flagged and removed- is seems that Israel supporters have the thinnest skin when criticized!	You cannot comment your honest opinions without it being flagged by someone who doesn't agree, rendering comment threads pointless.
18248182	Sorry, Facebook doesn't do much better. There are plenty of trolls on Facebook and those trolls have no problems expressing themselves. There are bigots, liars, people who love to say sensational things, people who will insinuate in order to hurt others and they are all on Facebook. There's plenty of vitriol on Facebook as well. Try to have a conversation in some of the groups and there's always someone who comes on with a completely uncalled for comment.	Facebook is full of trolls, who attack others on comments sections. On Facebook comments there are people who are there to attack and hurt other people. People make uncalled for comments.
18242358	Women take a risk in using their real name. It is not worth it. There are too many seriously deranged people out there. Beyond that I have a name that was once used by a famous stripper and also by a character in a comic strip. Over the years my phone number has received some very interesting unsolicited calls and I have been told me real name was not real (the comic strip interpretation) including on my resume. Monitored comments is the sensible solution. And yes, I avoid Facebook because of the name required mandate.	There are too many deranged people out there to use your real name especially if you are a woman.
18250250	Ms. Lemieux wants to silence those who disagree with her. Wouldn't someone with an open mind want to know what readers with a different viewpoint have to say? Or, wouldn't a thoughtful writer want to read well written comments praising their writing and opinion but perhaps offering some added insight? I agree with a need for moderators, but to scrap the comments section altogether is to throw away the best part of this online newspaper.	A person with an open mind should want to know what readers with different viewpoints have to say, and a thoughtful writer should want to read well written comments, praising and offering insight. Moderation might be needed, but the comments section is the best part of the online newspaper.
18250354	In all honesty, if I were a published author (as I aspire to be someday), I might not want to read even the good comments about my work. I do know some authors who do not read either the good nor the bad. That, to me, is understandable. However, why should the rest of the world feel the same way? If someone wants to offer an insight - and other people read it and get something from it (whether or not the original author gets involved), why deny that basic right to free speech? There will always be bullies, online or in the real world. You cannot stop them completely, but to not allow the general public to have discourse because trolls exist, then why write anything in the first place? You may as well keep it in diary form, to be seen by no one by yourself.	The basic right to free speech should not be denied if other people can read and benefit from someone's insight, whether or not the original author gets involved. There will always be people who make negative comments but comment sections allow a place for thoughtful discussions on issues affecting our communities. Getting rid of comments sections to stop trolls prevents the rest of the public from engaging in meaningful discourse.
18250327	The NY Times comments are the only ones I read anymore, so I would hate for it to be discontinued. I can imagine the work involved in moderating the comments; unfortunately, I don't see a way around it anymore to keep thought-provoking, and informative dialog going. It is sad, but it is also obvious that there are more than a few people who troll various sites for issues/people that bother them so they can unleash their self-righteous intolerance and name-calling. Ironically, it is usually these same people projecting their negative attributes to others. I enjoy the NYT comments section. Most of the comments seem well thought out and on-point, and the commenters are very knowledgeable. I frequently learn something new or see a point of view I hadn't considered.	Comments sections have failed with the exception of the New York Times. comments sections have been blocked due to disrespectful words. I enjoy the NYT comments. The majority of the comments are accurate and concise provided by knowledgeable people. People can learn a lot from reading the comments.
18250276	"Democracy is coming / to the USA." - Leonard Cohen. COMMENTS are a major factor in this democratization, although, yes of course, each site needs a moderator to keep the conversation level and the tone constructive. Only an authoritarian sinecure of the MSM will argue otherwise.	Comments, with good moderation, are a part of democracy.
18250168	Is it not unfair for a writer in a public forum to be able to say whatever they want through whatever bias they have and personal agenda without any recourse? These people should know that their words are like bullets and they they can expect return fire from those of us who may think differently. This is still America where contrary opinions are both legal and valuable if we are ever to be able to compromise and get results for the people. Our system is designed to take into consideration all views and to come to some compromise. Even the President welcomes competing opinions. Shouldn't writers?	Words matter and people who think differently should be able to respond. In America differing opinions are not only allowed but they have value teaching us to compromise for the best results. We are able to take into consideration all views and come to a compromise. Writers should welcome opinions.
18250796	I think it's great that the reading public can now freely comment on articles and editorials in the corporate media. It's about time that the people have the right to talk back to the erstwhile gatekeepers who try to decide what's news and how it should be presented. If writers and journalists can't stand the heat they should grow a thicker skin or get out of the kitchen.	The reading public can use comments sections to voice their opinion on media. People have the right to talk back to the gatekeepers who determine what news is presented and how.
18251925	Many times I find comments more interesting and accurate then the articles. The writer of this article thought it ok when writing comments and now feels something has changed somehow for the worse? I do not agree. Does that make me a troll?	Comments sections have not failed because the comments are often engaging and insightful.
18251910	Some other sites or newspapers may allow vulgarity and animosity but I have never seen it on NYT, and in fact I feel the comments make the article more interesting and sparks discussion. I look forward to reading others' thoughts on the subjects explored by the authors of the articles published here. On other sites, I rarely read the comments. I do appreciate the moderation very much. I hope NYT does not do away with comments.	The NYT seems to have good and clean comments unlike some other sites. Comments add interest and spark discussion. They provide other peoples perspectives on topics.
18249380	I read NY Times and Washington Post but only read and occasionally respond with comment to NY times articles. NY times management of comments is exemplary and enlightening. I do not like to read David Brooks or Douthat without reading Gemli comments.	Management of comments are exemplary and enlightening.
18249368	The New York Times has it right. A moderated comments facility provides immense value to readers seeking to understand the considered views of fellow human beings. Understanding the interests of others and seeking sensible consensus and compromise is one of the key foundations of a democracy. In times of bleak news, the NY Times comments pages provide a heartbeat of global perspective that reminds one the world is full of good, interested and decent people who care enough to speak out.	Comments, when moderated, provide value to readers. Comment sections allow for understanding of other views and reaching a consensus and compromise just like in any democracy. The NY Times comments remind of the good and decent people in the world who speak out where there is a lot of bleak news elsewhere.
18249360	Buyer beware. Most comments pages are a dead zone. On the other hand, I love the NYTs comments - so insightful. I look forward to reading them and they are a significant addition to the piece. What is better than hearing what my fellow human beings (and NYT readers) have to say? There are several other sites that I feel the same way about. Other than that I just avoid them.	Most comment pages are inactive. Comments on the New York Times are insightful. They add a lot to the piece and I look forward to reading comments. Hearing what fellow readers have to say is a positive.
18249237	I don't think I would even read the Times any more if it didn't have a moderated comments section. I don't trust the reporting any more without checking the comments. I am sure the Times knows how much valuable content they are getting for free.	Some readers would not read the Times if not for a comments section. I need the comments to trust the reporting in the article. Comments are valuable content.
18249225	Even the comments on the Washington Post are appalling. While one might think there would be some intelligent commentary accompanying news articles in that respected venue, a relatively small posse of regulars-on both sides of the political spectrum-seize every chance to hurl utterly unrelated partisan insults at one another. Sometimes I think the Post just republishes the same comment section day after day. And then I kick myself for wasting my time looking for signs of intelligent life. The Times, on the other hand, does a great job of moderating.	Even the Washington Post comments section is abused. Comments sections are full of partisan individuals looking for a fight, not a conversation.
18249187	The Guardian has recently cut down on the numbers of articles that allow reader comments. Like the Times, the comments are well moderated and also often more interesting and informative than the actual article. I notice I am reading the Guardian less, the site just isn't as interesting without the reader comments.	Well moderated comments can be more interesting and useful than the article. Now that the Guardian has removed comments, I am not interested in reading it very much anymore.
18249031	Comments are a useful and frequently informative part of online news; they should be encouraged but much more closely monitored. For openers, commenters should be allowed only one comment per article to avoid these ubiquitous back and forth , witless arguments which often clog the comments section. Obscene, vulgar and personal attacks should be edited out, but care must be exercised. Many subjects almost demand strong comments which some may find offensive, but do not really cross the line. Some are clearly at the far left, right, or some other extreme, but often bring out ignored, but important points of view. In addition, many articles and editorials contain claims that are either wrong or at best distorted, despite usually high standards of editorial review. Comments are essential for correcting these problems. Some blogs, like Prof Juan Cole usually contain thoughtful, informed and useful information. Others seem to call forth the the worst forms of trolls, bullys, idiots and haters. Proper monitoring, I believe can correct the abuses and allow a very important part of the internet to thrive.	Comments are informative. Some subjects require strong comments, that might offend some without crossing the line. Comment sections allow different points of view to be heard. Many editorials are wrong or distorted and their claims are corrected in the comments.
18248691	Human moderation is the key. There are terms and conditions, and if a commenter fails to meet them, their comment does not get posted. The network should disallow anonymous posting. This means comment sections cost a newspaper more money, as they generate money. Do they make a profit? As newspapers are firing employees, it becomes a hard choice. If disabling a comment section does not hurt the bottom line, get rid of it. No one wants to know what is at the anonymous back of anyone's mind in the age of social media.	Moderation is the key.
18248616	Moderate and block if necessary. Without readers comments the Times would be greatly diminished. I'm as interested in them as I am in my most respected reporters and columnist. Comments sections that are not moderated get no attention from me. The Times is to be commended for supporting readers comments even though they are often managed arbitrarily as Margaret Sullivan's last column's comments were and are. Where probably hundreds of readers positive remarks were not posted. it was an important column from an admired writer.	Moderators are needed. Publications like The Times would be less interesting without comments. The comments sections are becoming not available because of insane words.
18248249	Moderated comments are an excellent way for original ideas to be heard from the most unlikely corners. Sifting through a lot of unmoderated comments is not only distressing for the author, it is discouraging for the reader and serious commentator. Publications that want to engage a mass audience and those that seek to interact with more narrow expert audiences should put the resources into professionally moderating comments.	Moderated comments are a great way for unlikely sources to have their opinions heard. Publications that want to engage an audience should be prepared to moderate feedback.
18248245	Media has found too much truth in readers' comments and has started censoring views contrary to who pays the bills. The Daily KOS for example has flagged more negative views on Hillary than any other Progressive site. This is NOT freedom of speech when others have the power to silence your opinion. And even the NYT was guilty of a lack of attention to Sanders campaign for awhile. Yet Trump has garnished more free publicity than them all because of the increased readership draw, therefore more profits in their advertising dollars. And around the world we are laughed at because we have a reality show candidate, another family oligarch, and all the other clowns on the Republican wagon. Welcome to the Freakshow.	Truthful comment sections have failed because of censorship. You don't have freedom of speech when others have power to silence your opinion.
18248110	I have to agree with all the other posters that a moderated comments section is one of the things that makes the NYT great and worth the cost of subscription. I like to read the intelligent thoughts of so many of its readers and find that often there is much to be learned from the commentors' writings.	New York Times's comment section makes them great because they are moderated. It is often educational to read commentors' opinions.
18248069	The best comments are those that make me think about things differently. They often introduce thoughts and ideas that haven't been given a voice in regular editorial content. And often they are those with which I disagree. Such comments are rare--a rate I would guess at less than 1 in 20. But if they introduce me to a new way of thinking, or of just understanding my fellow humans, it's well worth sorting through the other 19. Editing makes all the difference. The Times' editing is, to some extent, crowd sourced--the most popular comments are given prominence. I will, from time to time, up-vote a comment with which I disagree just because it introduces a new idea.	Comment sections with good comments help me see different views. Comment sections provide a voice to thoughts and ideas outside the scope of regular editorial content. Finding one gem in the comments section is worth all of the other problems.
18247937	I am extremely grateful for the moderators at NYT, and I shudder to think of the things they must have to read through. The NYT comments are the only ones I currently read. I follow many comment writers here, both agreeing and disagreeing with them. Some I look forward to, if only to have my own world view challenged. It would be too easy to read only those opinions that I share, and have myself devolve into a participant in the echo chamber that seems to feed too many steadfastly held beliefs out there. As for the anonymity, I never really thought that I might be hiding behind my user name. It goes way back to 1999 when I first subscribed. I am Tom Tyson, and I live in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. You can call me Tom.	Comment sections provide divergent opinions and different world views.
18247574	I agree with many of my fellow commenters that the NYT does an excellent job of moderating comments, and I am extremely grateful for the resources they expend to offer this service. Being able to comment has made a big difference to me as a professional --I find it an invaluable outlet. Plus, reading NYT comments generally makes me feel pretty hopeful about humanity, as a matter of fact.	The NYT always does a good job modding comments. Commenting is an invaluable outlet in my experience as a professional. Reading comments can make one feel better about humanity.
18247300	Without open comment, I rarely any longer bother to read the article. Unlike Jamilla, I always check the comments first to see whether the article will be exciting. The NYTimes is the only venue that censors over half of my remarks, the Post and WSJ almost never. I don't mind offending, but find what is censored 100% here is trying to be funny or ironic. I noticed even as a kid that the liberal elite has zero sense of humor....	Many things that are censored are trying to be funny or ironic.
18247221	One of my favorite sections of the printed NY Times is the letters to the editor. The comments sections on the website are even more pleasing, because there are more comments than could possibly be printed, most of which are very well written. I recognize that moderation is essential, and hope that the Times will continue to devote resources in that direction.	Comments are plentiful and generally well written.
18247137	Another tragedy of the commons. For newspapers, restricting access to paid subscribers would probably end this problem, or ameliorate it enough. Non-subscribers could solve math problems or the like before being given access to make comments, one problem solved per comment made. Skin needs to be in the game or there are no rules.	Restricting access to paid subscribers and people who solve simple problems before posting would end the problem. Unless commenters have investment in the story, they won't behave appropriately.
18247132	I learn quite a lot from NYT comments, often and in particular from thoughtful comments by authors who think differently from me. I find them valuable. I think the Times' general level of commentary is good. This in part results from the Times' curating its comments, which filters the merely shrill or ad hominem screeds. I recognize this also introduces curatorial bias, but for me, the reduction in noise is welcome. I hope the Times continues to solicit reader commentary. I think its system is working well.	Comment sections have varied and valuable opinions. I think the general level of comments in the Times are good.
18247080	I personally think that any organization allowed to provide Press Cards to its employees should be required by the law to have a public section comment on its website. Think about it, people are being put in jail to protect the right of journalists. The least they can do is defending the freedom of speech of others, journalists need to be held accountable on that, a right without a duty is an oligarchic priviledge. They should be required to provide and sustain a space for open debate for any information they provide. Comments sections have fails because media failed them by treating them as after thoughts, and under investing in them. What's missing is a whole ecosystem of accountability as far as journalism and freedom of speech are concerned.	Comment section have failed because they do not provide a space for open debate. Comment sections have their disadvantages. Comments sections fail because they are underfunded. Journalism and freedom of speech are missing an ecosystem of accountability.
18247022	The New York Times often reinforces its editorial biases by carefully editing out comments from readers who do not agree with them. Its comments sections are thus made into a propaganda device, adding force to the paper's views. The comment from readers of the Washington Post are too often degraded by the inclusion of personal attacks upon other posters.The glue--rubber form of discourse.	Comments are not reliable because they are edited. Comment sections are just a propaganda device. Commenters on the Washington POst are often degraded and receive personal attacks.
18246928	I appreciate the fact that the NYT moderates comments, even if it means mine don't go up for 12 or 18 hours. That said, there does seem to be a decline recently in the quality of some comments on your site, which may reflect growing crassness that you can't always catch, or that you're letting more get through without moderation. Please stand by your principles and keep the conversation civil.	When comments are moderated, it is appreciated by people like me.
18246826	Comments sections provide an important outlet for people who may not otherwise have a sounding board. Though it may be true that truly illuminating comments are few and far between, there is value in people being able to voice their opinion. Of course, there are people who take advantage of it with vile comments, so that is why we need quality moderators.	Comments sections are useful, they provide a way for people to speak their minds. Comment sections provide a place for people to have their opinion heard.
18246631	But what if Ms. Lemieux has an error in her post/article? No one is perfect, & there are cases where dates, figures, etc. may appear in error. If the author claims to never read the comments, how will she know if there are technical errors/ Even the best websites with editors still need correction from time to time.	Some of the dates and figures may be in error by mistake. Even the best writers and editors need correction, sometimes.
18246610	In many cases, I get more from the comments section on this site than from the article. I like to hear what regular people are dealing with in daily life rather than the "Yipee! The economy is great because these numbers say so" type comments.	Comments can be more valuable than the articles themselves sometimes. It's preferable to hear what people are really dealing with rather than mindless comments devoid of thought.
18246465	1) Except for updates and corrections to the story, authors who get involved in the comments section of their articles are not doing themselves any service. 2) It may come as a surprise, but authors of articles are not omniscient. Comment sections usually bring out pertinent points and perspectives that the author omits. 3) It is important, especially for social and politics issues to understand not only the content of an article but what the opinion of the public is toward the article that can be particularly important, and more relevant than any poll. 4) The internet is, by nature, interactive. If you present topics of current interest and don't give people the ability to interact with them, people will go elsewhere to where they can. 5) Most people want to have a discussion about issues that of importance to them, few simply want to sit and be lectured to.	They expose important points often left out by the author. Comment sections provide the public's opinion of an article more accurately than polls. The internet allows people to seek out topics that interest them. People want to discuss issues rather than be told what to think.
18246474	It would be an enormous mistake to get rid of comments sections as so often the comments outshine the actual article and offer a range of opinions no single author can compete with. As others have said, comments generally needs to be monitored which obviously has a financial cost to it, but it would be impossible to go back to a world where only the author gets to weigh in.	Comments are often better than the article itself.
18246375	I view comments as part of he cost of doing business and think they should remain. I scroll over the vulgar, bigoted and racist ones but have learned much from additional views contributed by people worldwide. Comments provide new dimension to stories and sometimes vital insight.	Comments are part of the cost of doing business. Comments from individuals and their viewpoints has brought new insight to topics. Comments give new perspectives and context to stories.
18246336	Aside from the NYT, participating in most other comment-enabled media is often like a Trump rally with its mindless vitriol and verbal violence. Who needs to be exposed to that and how does that benefit civil discourse, the basis of any democratic society's ability to thrive.	With the exception of the NYT. Comments often show mindless vitriol and verbal violence.
18245616	I don't think comments sections have failed; the media have failed. I see several things happening; - first, the fat cats who control these things (the press, newsletters, etc.) don't want to be publicly embarrassed by well-written, cogent counter arguments; and two, they have found out that they can't hire editors to handle the volume for thirty cents a day. The sheer volume itself is an indicator of how deep the sense of abandonment is among the hoi polloi.	Comment sections have not failed.  The media has failed. Publications don't want to be embarrassed by well written, coherent arguments, and they are unable to hire editors for a low cost to handle the job.
18245183	Don't jettison them altogether, moderate them the way the Times does. I love reading the comments in the Times, they are mostly well-written, and sometimes extremely well written, and I often learn more about the topic and various ways of thinking about it. Thanks, all you regular Times commentators! But, I would agree that most sites that don't moderate their comments are cesspools of vitriol and snark, and not worth reading at all.	Often times, I gain important insight and knowledge from the comment section.
18244954	The problem is how nasty, vulgar, and hate filled many of those unmoderated comments can be. Until the web provided unfiltered commentary, an editor always moderated publication. What we have in unmoderated commentary is often not the correcting of misstatements, or the expanding of the conversation, but commenters attacking other commenters, hurling insults, changing the subject to beat the commenter's drum. We get lots of Obama hate even when the subject isn't Obama. If we had a culture of common courtesy before this, it's been severely jeopardized by coarse talk in comment sections. We even see that coarseness celebrated now as a good thing.	Comments sections, when unfiltered, will always be vulgar, nasty, and hate-filled. Comment sections devolve into insults and demagoguery. People do not show respect in comments sections, which takes away from their value.
18244616	Oftenthe comments sections are where the biased reporting is set to rights. Unfortunately for those of us who used to rely on the NYT to be unbiased straightforward reporting, thst has changed. As a result, opinions are presented as facts. Words pregnant with multiple meanings are used to slant stories to placate corproate owners. Comments give those of us who read other sources like European papers to as a bit of balance and to fact check the fact checkers. Comments are important. Those who don't like them have very likely been found out once to often by observant readers and they want it to stop! Let the people talk.	Biased reporting is called out in the comment section. Comments allow those with other knowledge to act as a balance and fact check the article.
18243112	Comments are necessary because Opinion pieces and publications are often promoting a narrow agenda that is masquerading as majority opinion and settled debate. Comments section balances out the opinion and offers an alternate view as well as evidence that contradicts the opinion piece. That is what a good debate is about. Comments should be moderated but with a light touch that allows legitimate discussion to get through. I would not read any article or publication that does not allow comments to get through. My opinion of an editorial or commentary immediately goes down and I ascribe less value to that article if it does not accept comments. Not accepting comments means that the author is afraid of debate and criticism and has this superior attitude, that I know more than you and therefore you have to accept my opinion as the the final word on this topic. No you are not, and no I don't have to!	Comments sections are necessary to give a wide variety of opinions. Comment sections allow other views to be heard. Moderated comments allow legitimate discussion. Comment sections add value to an editorial or commentary; the lack of comments earns the item less respect from the reader. Not accepting comments means the author is shying away from debate.
18242280	One does NOT have to read the comments, and one can easily skip over the hate. But often I learn more from the comments than from the article, story, or opinion piece. Sadly, the media is so biased and slanted (NYT included) that without the comments one simply does not really know what is going on.	No one is forced to read the comment section. People learn a lot from comment sections. The media is biased, and comment sections can help one understand what is really going on.
18244013	Comment sections are important in understanding the viewpoints and passions that may incite people to disagree. In the empathetic exercise of understanding why people think or feel how they do, we can better understand their argument so that it can be fought with reason - instead of dismissed on grounds that one is crazy or bigoted. Personally I love reading the opinion pieces where multiple writers take a different spin on the same prompt, and comments sections allow a microcosm to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of dozens of perspectives.	Comment sections are important to understand why people disagree. Comment sections have not failed because with out them it cannot be seen how people feel and there is no place to create reason instead of dismissal. Comment sections provide different views on opinion pieces. Comments sections permit a reader to analyze many different perspectives in one place.
18244743	Until recently I was a frequent contributor to the comment section of my local newspaper. When I began contributing I had hoped for intelligent and meaningful discussion and debate concerning the subject. What I had found was a medium consisting of contributors who, by appearances, thrive on belittling and disparaging attacks on those who don't share their beliefs. After a few years, I removed my profiles due to the increasing belittlement and disparagement of posters who may disagree with ones opinion. These forums appear, to me, nothing more than an electronic school yard full of anonymous bullies who have little to offer to any debate or discussion. I welcome the moderation the NY Times offers the readers and contributors to the online comments. Regards, Dan	I recently stopped contributing to the comment section of my local newspaper. Comment sections have people who attack those who disagree with them. I stopped posting after years of attacks. Comment sections have devolved into anonymous school yard bullying, offering no debate or discussion.
18244216	The Slowly Boiled Frog is mostly about LGBT advocacy. I frequently have posts with 100  comments (unmoderated). My experience is that opponents to gay rights tend to behave themselves; framing their arguments as inoffensively as possible. Meanwhile my core readers refine and shape their arguments accordingly which, I think, serves them and us. I have learned a thing or two from a dedicated reader. I have also witnessed opponents gaining a greater understanding of our needs and concerns. No, I think that the comments section is a very good thing.	Opponents tend to behave themselves and frame their arguments inoffensively. Comment sections permit opposing sides to see and understand the other side of a debate.
18241716	Comment sections are forms of direct engagement with customers and outlets that let them run wild without supervision have themselves to blame for the vitriol. Engagement is too valuable to the organization for it to give up and eliminate comments. As a form of engagement, which drives loyalty and repeat business, it must be invested in by paying for moderators. If your comments section is failing don't blame the haters, blame yourself for lack of investment.	Comment sections allow customers to have direct engagement. Engagement in the comment section is valuable to the organization.
18242533	I agree with J.L. that it's time to give up on comments and save the staff the unpleasant task of reading them as well as the expense of moderators. Free speech is precious but is easily abused in non productive ways. Let's revert to letters to the editor and other forms of essays that rely on reason and admit failure with the online comment experiment.	Comments are not worth the hassle and expense. Free speech is easily abused in non productive ways. Online comments are a failed experiment and we should go back to letters to the editor that require at least an essay format.
18241379	While it's true that many unmoderated comments sections can become sewers (the NY Daily News section was an absolute cesspool...), moderated comments sections like those The Times actually make a tremendous contribution to both reader understanding of the issues and our political process. I would also stipulate that allowing anonymous comments can indeed be problematic, and that commentators should be willing to disclose their identity when expressing their opinion - and thus expose themselves to the potential scrutiny that goes along with doing this.	Comment sections can be full of bad language if left unmoderated.
18241072	I agree with some sort of moderation, including blocking the repeatedly abusive. There is no need for anonymity but it does help encourage the comments from insiders on various issues. "Comments" sections seem to me to satisfy the "Ray Healey rule of debate" (my dad) who said that you should not enter into an argument unless you are prepared to be persuaded. If I were the publisher, my columnists would read the comments, or go back to blogging.	Comment sections satisfy the argument that you should  not enter into an argument unless you are prepared to be persuaded.
18240942	Please do not take away the comment section in the NY Times! I will occasionally read comments on more conservative publications and marvel at the time people take to post hateful, nasty comments. But when I read the NY Times comment section, my faith in humanity is restored; not only are the comments smart and well thought out, but because the Times has strict standards for publishing comments, there's certainly disagreement but never direct hatred and threats.	Some comments sections, like the NY Times, are well moderated and full of intellectual, thoughtful comments.
2272145	They may be trying to close the achievement gap, but are they doing so at the expense of good teachers? Good teachers are the ones who love to teach and want to be in the classroom for the long haul. Every major newspaper reports of budget cuts to educaion on the local level and of teacher layoffs. It is an insult to hear of hard working certified teachers being replaced by someone who is marking time for a year or two until they get into law school or find something that pays better.	Good teachers will teach because they want too, not because of Teach for America's programming. Across the states we are seeing many teacher layoffs and budget cuts. I am insulted that  good teachers being replaced by teachers waiting for a year or two to get into law school or a better paying job.
2262535	Foote quotes someone who compares TFA volunteers to Army recruits. Even there, in fact, TFA suffers by comparison. Soldiers spend more time in basic training than the few weeks that TFA recruits do, let alone all the additional training specialists get. So what she's saying, effectively, is that the message of TFA is that teaching is less difficult than learning to march, obey orders and fire a gun.	It's easier to march, obey orders, and fire a gun than to teach, according to TFA.
2261460	This article screams entitlement. After a year, you're an expert? Having been in the trenches of education reform for 25 years before becoming a classroom teacher a few years ago, I can tell you that your youthful arrogance is extremely naive. Whatever talk Washington is talking today will be different than the talk Washington will be talking in a few years. In the meantime, y'all keep flitting in and out of these children's worlds and patting yourselves on the back for making such a difference. I used to admire Teach for America back in the day when it was beginning. It is now populated by such an entitled group of self-serving neophytes who believe only they have THE true answer to the problems of public education that I have lost all respect. Oh, and dear - could you a) list each of the "much easier ways to burnish a resume," and b) look the students and their families in the face when you speak of ",,,hard labor in some of the crummiest classrooms in America?" I'm sure they'd appreciate the reference.	The group is comprised of self-serving individuals no longer focused on the issues surrounding public education.
2262077	Teach for America has done nothing for public school teachers's status. The only thing it has done is fetishize its own image, to create a trendy CV filler for cossetted Ivy Leaguers. The vast majority of TFA teachers don't stay in the profession, so the job becomes little more than a balm for their conscious before they move on to JP Morgan Chase and like-minded capitalist enterprises. It takes more than two years to become a good teacher, so if TFA has such a low retention rate for its students, how can it be rated a success? The fact that admission is difficult doesn't mean its a good program.	TFA is just CV-fodder and not helpful for teachers. TFA doesn't train career teachers, but is a stop-gap for more lucrative employment. TFA has a low retention rate so it is not always considered successful.
2261790	A retired teacher who observed, and often mentored, many Teach for America teachers, I whole-heartedly support Ms. Crocco's observations. In what other profession would it be assumed that minimal training, no matter how well-educated one happens to be, is sufficient to enter the field: law, medicine? The fact we not only allow it, but encourage such an approach in eduction to me says a great deal about how teaching is viewed in this country, that is, it is not truly a profession. One will never build a first-class educational system based on this widely held conviction. For further thoughts, I refer the reader to the book by Diane Ravitch (one of the best historians of American schools) The Death and Life of the Great American School system.	No other field would rely on minimal training before entering the field, and this should be no different. We can't raise the status of teachers or build a first-class educational system in this country until we view teachers as true professionals.
2261238	I wonder how having one or two Teach for America teachers at a school can make a difference. A few children, lucky to be in those classes, may benefit but how does it benefit the school as a whole? And what does it do for the morale of the regular teaching staff, many of whom may be wonderful, dedicated teachers to have these neophytes who come with a label of special, gifted drop into their schools as though manna from heaven? Finally, do these special, gifted new teachers have some kind of solution for the poverty and other conditions that surely have at least, if not more, to do with the condition of their schools and their academic achievement than does the ability of the teacher? Can they magically help the parent who doesn't have the education to help or encourage the child? Can they promise these kids that if they work hard and do well, they will have a better life?	TFA does not help public school teachers as a whole, there are some passing benefits for a class or two but it makes me wonder about the students not in those classes or the school itself benefiting. TFA decreases morale of regular teachers by promoting inexperienced teachers over them. Do these special, gifted new teachers have some kind of solution for poverty, and other conditions to do with the condition of their schools, and their academic achievement than does the ability of the teacher? Can they magically help the parent who doesn't have the education, or helps/encourages the child?.
2261031	There is currently a glut of qualified teachers. Why are we taxpayers paying millions of dollars for TFA and, here in NYC, NYC Teaching Fellows, et al while other grad students like myself are struggling to get through paying our own way and facing more and more miserable job prospects?? Why should I (and laid off teachers) have to compete with govt-sponsored, less-qualified drones who are hand-picked for their willingness to follow blindly if not for the fact that they water down the labor force in a period when the government is trying to undercut and underfund US education?	We currently have a glut of teachers. Tax money going to TFA is unfair to other people who struggle to pay their own way through school and still lack good job opportunities. Good teachers shouldn't be forced to compete for jobs against those who have no true skills but are picked by the government because they follow along like sheep. This is simply another way the government is undermining public education in the US.
2264611	Many TFA folks are feeling defensive these days, and rightly so. The program promises more than it can deliver. It is not the fault of these idealistic and/or ambitious young people that the program has been overly touted as the silver bullet for all education's problems. There is nothing wrong with leaving education after two years, becoming an administrator or going to law school. The problem is that attrition is basically a design feature of the program. An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years. I almost did, until I realized that I needed to set boundaries and have a life. The problem is that students pay by losing energetic teachers every year, would-be teachers are discouraged and leave the classroom, and the taxpayers are footing too much of the bill for a program with questionable returns. There needs to be an overhaul if the public is to be expected to continue supporting a program that is not successful in helping create long term stability in schools.	TFA cannot live up to its promise to solve all of education's problems, notwithstanding the good intentions of its young teachers. It is ok to leave teaching after two years. TFA has short term gain over long term loss. TFA has high turnover by design and is expensive.
2264131	Some of my best students--bright, knowledgeable, committed--wanted to teach for America. I advised them against it. They did not have experience. Schools deserve the best teachers possible, especially in challenging schools. Being a good and effective teacher requires years of training and then continuing education,, not just in one's subject, but also in pedagogy, didactics, classroom management, organization, etc. Other countries train teachers much better and longer: they have years of specialized course work and then up to two years of assistant teaching. It pays off. Like the structural inequality that finances schools through property taxes, teacher training in the US is vastly uneven and thus perpetuates social inequality and hinders economic progress. We need uniform standards across states, equal funding for all schools, and a better education for educators.	Good teachers need both experience and education.
2264065	As someone who attended an elementary school which received TFA teachers and as an 'elite' college graduate who saw classmates fight for spots, I have mostly contempt for Teach For America. However, I see that one thing that high flying elementary education systems around the world have in common is that teaching is a prestigious career that the top college students fight for. Look at South Korea. If TFA starts America along that path, then I suppose it can be endured.	TFA has made teaching positions something that the best and brightest are in competition for. TFA increases interest in public education teachers so what I believe to be negative about it can be tolerated.
2263627	The success stories highlighted here seem to be away from the classroom; why is that ? Because the reward system is skewed away from the very very hard work of the great classroom teacher. I understand that the idea is to use these talented few to create more great teachers. This is not a new model, however; the status quo is largely predicated on it. Make classroom teaching as financially rewarding as staff work and you'll get there. Who stands in the door( like a George Wallace) blocking this kind if revolutionary reform? Da Teachers Unions...	The hard-working great classroom teacher is not rewarded under TFA system. TFA does not help because teaching needs to be more financially sound as a career  to have positive returns to the public school system.
2264964	Teaching is a profession. Who would go to a college graduate with no specialized skills rather than to a trained doctor to diagnose and treat a medical problem? Who would trust that same unspecialized college graduate to build a bridge or argue a case in court? Why then do we think that college graduates, albeit bright, well-intentioned, and enthusiastic ones, are ready to teach our children when they have had no educational training? It is an insult to their students.	People prefer professional people who have actually been trained. TFA does not provide skilled teachers to students.
9565873	Why is the queen's retirement even a subject for debate? She is of sound mind and body and clearly is not ready to abdicate. Most monarchs reign until death if they are capable. Charles (and William) will just have to wait.	Why are we debating the queen's retirement?. Queen Elizabeth is healthy, and does not need to step down. Typically, monarchs lead their country until their death.
9565783	Having been born "Her Majesty's Loyal Subject (albeit Colonial-hence no longer one), I would like to see Charles become King before he reaches his mother' s age. Yes, I know William is much cooler. however whatever his shortcomings, Charles does not deserve the unprecedented humiliation of being passed over after waiting patiently and loyally for over 40 years. It's just not fair. I think Charles would be a reasonably good Monarch. His biggest problem is Camilla. I'm going to be brutally honest, and expect to get some flak as a result. Dianna was undoubtedly the Queen of Hearts, a star with a capital S, gorgeous, charismatic and blessed with incredible ability for empathy. However as Eliabeth has proven beyond doubt, one does not need to be a star to be a good monarch. Camilla is no Dianna, but she is, like it or not infinitely more suited to be Queen of the Realm then Dianna could ever hope to be.	Charles should become King at a younger age than his mother's. Queen Elizabeth should step down and let Charles rule, who has been waiting patiently. The queen shouldn't be a star.
9565635	It's time for the whole Windsor tribe and their cohorts to go. Royalty and a royal birth a major event in the Twenty-First Century is some kind of lunacy, certainly in any rational world. Why don't they just retire their royal titles and go back to Germany and spent their time breeding pedigreed (titled) cattle. On the cusp of my adulthood, I left the United Kingdom in 1945 because I had no intention of becoming the 'subject' of anyone!	The Windsor family all needs to leave. Royalty and royal birth are outdated.
9564566	I think if one had Prince Charles for a son, watched how he treated Diana, and learned of the Camilla as tampon conversation her stepping down would be unworth of her. QEII loves England and while she also loves her son why would she inflict him a people she cares for. He is a lightweight and if we may use his past behavior as a future predictor I'd say stay on the throne Granny. Then maybe Chuck will have the good sense (not likely) to step down and let William reign. OK so it's a fantasy. Shoot me.	Why should Queen Elizabeth II should not have to inflict her country with her son. Queen Elizabeth's successor would not be able to handle the throne.
9561738	As a five year old, I watched the young Queen take up royal duties, after the death of her beloved father. In 1953, her government was still struggling with the aftermath of the wholesale destruction and devastation of Britain and the loss of a whole generation of young men....Governing a country is no easy task. It ignores the facts to imply that all she knows is horses. Having lived through some of the more catastrophic changes on this planet, political as well as economic and personal; bringing a country back from the ruins, and having been forced to make some very tough decisions, which impact millions of people, not just a few paragraphs... Her Royal Highness, has probably, more wisdom than all journalists combined.	Having lived through some of the more catastrophic changes on this planet, political as well as economic. Having made some very tough decisions, which impact millions of people...Her Royal Highness, has probably, more wisdom than all journalists combined.
9559686	I can't think of a reason for the Queen to abdicate her solemn responsibilities. Should she become incapacitated the Privy Council has a mechanism for naming a regent. Charles should refuse the throne.. Nobody likes him. Of course, the British monarchy has evolved greatly over the past millennium or so, but historically, the monarch would have just as likely to have murdered or exiled the heir as to abdicate in his or her favor.	The Queen does not have a reason to give up her responsibilities.
9559268	1) Why are we even debating something that is none of our business in the USA? 2) As a 50  woman, I'm thrilled to have the Queen out in the spotlight at her age, on her own terms. The monarchy has never been a popularity contest, and the modern monarchy is about issues of traditional, not about actual governance.	Monarchy has never been a popularity contest, the modern monarchy is about issues of traditional, not about actual governance.
9557843	Fletcher has got it exactly right. The best solution would be for both Elizabeth and Charles to abdicate and turn the Firm over to William and Kate. But since that will not happen, let's postpone until we're left with no choice the ascension of Charles--and even worse, Camilla. The thought of boring, stuffed-shirt Charles as king for decades is bad enough, but having Camilla shoved front and center would be a nightmare come true, even without the formal title of queen. Imagine-year after year of pictures of the two puttering in their garden with their little spades and shooting grouse at Balmoral. Oh, the horror, the horror-made even worse by knowing that Will and Kate are having to lie low. Of course, knowing the media's attention will gravitate anyway toward the young and vibrant, I feel a tinge of sympathy for the sad fate awaiting Charles and Camilla.	Elizabeth and Charles should both step down and hand it over to William and Kate.
9557758	Simply said the Queen is not going to step down. Upon ascending to the throne she made a vow to serve her people until her death. Words and the people who spoke them truly meant something at that time and still do to people of her generation. Queen Elizabeth came to the throne during a very difficult period for her people and the world and she helped lead her nation from those days to today always as a constant source of pride and inspiration. And it appears that the qualities that made her a loved and inspirational leader skipped a generation bypassing her son, Charles, and now appears rooted in her grandson, William. So I say save the questions about stepping down for Charles for the day after he ascends to the throne.	The Queen is just not going to step down. It meant something to her generation to make a vow which she did to serve her people until her death. Queen Elizabeth II lead through difficult time periods and is a continued source of pride for the United Kingdom.
9556491	It doesn't matter what we think, but we hope the Queen would feel free to step down if she were so inclined. We doubt she would feel that way. It does not seem in the Queen's nature, having placed duty above all for decade after decade, and thinking of the war years and the Blitz and how close she is to being Monarch for a record number of years. Ultimately, we would expect precedent to not be broken. How does one vacate their birthright ?	It doesn't seem like Queen Elizabeth II has it in her nature to step down since she is so close to being a monarch for a record number of years. Precedent should not be broken. It is her birthright, you cannot walk away from that.
9563728	Queen Elizabeth has demonstrated she is a monarch with uncommonly good common sense. My guess is people can depend on that. For a lifetime, she has put the good of her people and country above all else. Why would anyone expect less of her in the future?	Queen Elizabeth exhibits good common sense. Queen Elizabeth II is still a capable and intelligent leader for the United Kingdom and should remain in power.
15421004	'You must vote," I often hear, "because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!" That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. "living Constitution", "originalism", "texturalism"; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not "umpires", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are "umpires" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game.	The Supreme Court can be influenced by partisan politics. Justices all follow their own set of rules, and in baseball, such a policy would destroy the game.
15418829	A core example of Kramer's argument is the Bush v Gore decision. The court anointed the head of the executive branch by first finding for Gore, but then not allowing the recount to proceed due to an arbitrary time limit the Court set. Never mind the votes, we got this. And yet, without a co-equal judicial branch, there is no protection against either the tyranny of the majority or the tyranny of vested minorities. MInorities like the super-rich, massive corporation-people, 40 senators, White House plumbers, or a president gone mad. If we agree a Court decision is wrong, changing the law or amending the Constitution can fix that.	The supreme court protects against tyranny. No matter the outcome of a court's decision, we always have the option to amend the Constitution or create and amend laws.
15424989	Of course legislation is a theoretically better option than a Supreme Court ruling. But legislators have proven themselves not to be bound by the constitution's guarantees of minority rights. The question remains whether majority votes can or should overrule minority rights. And if inalienable rights exist, a Supreme Court may be necessary to protect mob rule from extinguishing freedom of existence.	The supreme court helps minority rights. The Supreme Court provides a necessary check on mob rule.
15420691	I think it was Churchill who said that democracy is the second worst form of government devised by man. What's the worst? Everything else. Our democracy suffers from some serious dysfunctions as the writer notes but I'd be hesitant to entrust nine (actually 5) unelected, usually pretty disconnected jurists in black robes the power to ... well, keep expanding their power. Whether you consider any particular ruling open-minded or open-hearted or reactionary or downright evil or righteous, history is strewn with the corpses of societies which fail to improve their democracy and, instead, turn to a select cabal to make critically important decisions. You wouldn't even have to keep money out of politics if we worked harder at educating our electorate so that they understand the extent to which the rich and powerful, and their toadies in government, manipulate our fears and our wants to avoid what THEY fear get what THEY want. To think that those who are already part of the mightiest of the power elite will ever do what's necessary to protect those who are not part of the power elite is delusional, if not worse.	Churchill said democracy is bad. Justices are not elected with creates power issues.
15419119	I could not agree with Mr. Somins's opinion more. Without the court how long would it have taken for black children to go to school with white children? How long would it have taken for women to gain control of their bodies? How long until the LGBT could even have consensual sex in their own home? Without the Supreme Court we'd still be living in the dark ages.	Without the court it may have taken longer for school integration, female reproductive rights, and LGBT sexual rights. Without the Supreme Court, the US would be in the dark ages.
15418823	I would propose that Justices serve a fixed term, perhaps 12 years. No President should be allowed to make appointments that determine Supreme Court decisions for decades after that President is out of office or dead and all his policies possibly repudiated.	Presidents should not have the power to appoint such long-servicing justices that perpetuate his/her policies.
15421914	It is a known fact that the court has largely been a regressive institution of the status quo, upholding the worst aspects of our society, monopolies, capitalism, racism, slavery, Jim Crow, with holding of women's suffrage, segregation, abortion rights, voting rights and on and on. The exceptions are noteworthy and talked about as if they are heresy rather than proper. For example is it simply amazing that Justice Roberts cannot find anything in the Constitution that supports equal rights to marriage for all people!	The supreme court serves mainly to keep the status quo.
15416860	Nine people....deciding for all US citizens....: not democracy in action. Nine people...are not reflective of all US Citizens; do not represent all US citizens. Nine people...could topple our democracy....by simply saying....we are the rule of law. and. they are not ...the rule of law...the people are.	Nine judges making decisions for an entire country is too much power. The Supreme Court is only 9 people, and does not represent all US citizens. Nine people could disrupt our democracy.
12076148	Sounds like I'm not the only one who picked up on the obvious here, that cash is replacing regular patronage. Seems a dumb trade from the restaurateur's point of view. The few extra bucks he picks up from one-time diners is going to be drowned by all the money he loses from regular patrons, who can't get the convenience and service they want. They'll go elsewhere, and he'll never see those one-time trend-surfers ever again. Buh-bye, Empellon. As for myself, I think all this is deeply silly. If I can't get a table at a restaurant at a decent time without having to wait on line, I go somewhere else. Lots of people can cook. It's just not that rare a skill, especially in a city like New York.	Cash is replacing regular patronage. While extra profit can be made by paid reservations, more revenue will be lost due to diners who no longer eat there due to inconvenience associated with it. I will go somewhere else if I can't get a table at a restaurant without waiting.
12075756	How about the quant idea of respect for PATRONS, not attitude and an attempt add hidden fees (a la movie ticket 'service fees')? And a suggested correction: "If anyone understands anything about the economics of restaurants they would know that [ticked off patrons going elsewhere] are the difference between profit and [going out of business]." "If anyone understands anything about the economics of restaurants they would know that a few tables are the difference between profit and deficit."	There should be more focus on service and less on fees.
12074964	True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila!	Paid for reservations would save restaurants money that no-shows cause. Charge for the reservation and lower the bill by that amount. Everyone should pay the same for the same thing.
12074325	The author seems to excluding the most likely scenario which is the restaurants will sell some reservations AND continue to hold others for celebrities, the politically and socially well connected, and regular customers etc. Clubs, sporting events, etc. comp people all the time for admittance that would otherwise cost money. All this means is that the rest of us will pay to compete against each other for the limited pool of publicly available reservations. Hard to see how that is democratizing.	Restaurants will continue to keep reservations for higher class diners. Paying for restaurant reservations will force customers to compete against each other for a limited resource at an increased price.
12074161	I think this is a problem for most big cities like New York, Chicago, LA., Toronto and Montreal...and like is so often in these big cities money works for the wealthy. It buys great medical care, great dental care and great dinners. I come from the land of Joe Beef and Au Pied du Cochon and I can see myself buying a table at the last minute but if I don't care when I eat there then I will simply wait for an OpenTable or call. But then again our restaurants tend to be on the smaller size more petite size. Sometimes it take being a Chef to get into some of them.	I would be willing to buy a table if it was a last minute necessity but I will probably wait for an open table if time was not important.
12070390	According to Professor Cowen, "Money is ultimately a more egalitarian force than privilege, as everyone's greenbacks are worth the same." The reality is quite the opposite: money is far more authoritative than egalitarian, as those with the most money will always win in this situation. Everyone's greenbacks may be worth the same, but those with more greenbacks will be worth more. Therefore, the current system may be a pain, but it is far more egalitarian in its fairness than a system that allows those with the most money to go to the head of the line.	Those with the most money will always come out on top. Reservations for sell will affect those with less money. The current system is more fair than a system that would allow those with more money to go first.
12074722	I strongly agree. As far as I'm concerned, the money changes hands in exchange for the meal and the experience. And not for the privilege of walking through the door. And another thing, this is New York! Terrific dining can be found everywhere without trying to get a seat at the latest trendy spot.	Paying for the privilege of walking into the restaurant.
18655916	Seems reasonable but with a reduction in fee through a means test. And how about a CCC for appropriate deferred maintenance projects. And then how about a bigger budget from the increased tax revenues we will have from anticipated amendments to the Code.	This is reasonable as long as there is a fee reduction for the people who would need it.
18654175	An absolutely terrible idea. Wallace Stegner called them our best idea in that they are completely democratic, everybody can go. They should charge minimal entrance fees and the federal government should pony up the rest as it is only a tiny amount of the budget. Preservation isn't free. Give me a break.	Wallace Stegner said they were our best idea. Everybody should be able to go. Overcrowded national parks should not have restricted access, but should charge small feels for entrance with the federal government providing the other support to insure preservation.
18651294	Wrong, very wrong. What is needed is not higher fees, resulting in elitist parks, but increases in budgets to properly care for our parks. Like everything else the Republican Congress continues to shortchange our parks in order to fund fighter plane costing a billion dollars, Imagine what Yosemite National Park could do if the cost of one fighter was given to it.	Parks do not need higher fees but need increases in budgets to help care for parks. Congress dictates what happens in our parks.
18647705	Absolutely not. Increasing fees is the opposite of what we should be doing. The parks need more funding from the Federal budget. Which means we need to get those GOP members out of the House & Senate, since they only support billionaire tax breaks, evidently. We need MORE PARKS. And they should all be FREE. They are our - the American people's - great patrimony.	The government should decrease fees and increase government funding of parks. There should be more free parks.
18653311	Restricting access is essential since the world population has exploded and the a significant fraction of the National Park visitors are foreigners. The last time I hiked to the top of Half Dome in 2006, it was an awful experience with people falling over each other like in a shopping mall. Same with the hike to Cloud's Rest. I'm glad they introduced the lottery system for Half Dome. If folks really care about spending time in these precious places, they should have to make the early reservations for the most crowded places. I know we live in an instant gratification society, but we got to draw the line somewhere. In any case, there are several excellent Parks where once can go find camping spots on a first-come basis.	National parks should have restricted access because there is not enough space to accommodate everyone specifically foreigners. There were so many people it was as crowded as being in a shopping mall. People who care about spending time in these places should be willing to make early reservations for the crowded ones.
18648595	I love national parks. Growing up in India, unspoiled green spaces were really foreign, and National Parks are America's best idea for generations to come. I visit Mt Ranier National Park several times as it is almost in my backyard. I am struck by the damage that visitors can inflict on the fragile wild flower meadows in their eagerness and zeal to enjoy the beauty. While better funding and visitor resources such as mass transportation could help, something we can all do is volunteer at a NP for a few days a year. This will go a long way in relieving the already stretched NP resources and the benefit to the volunteer citizen is priceless. Picking up trash, pulling weeks, cataloging wildflowers, roving the meadows helping visitors, etc. can help give back to our country's best idea and recharge our batteries all in one act!!	In India parks are rare, National Parks are great for future generations. I have visited Mt Rainer several times. Access should not be restricted but solutions should be found to reduce impact such as volunteering or mass transit. More people need to volunteer at national parks.
19140904	Bless Justice Ginsburg for speaking out! It is unprecedented and beyond brave. I am scared of Donald Trump and I am grateful for her action. It is not lost on me that all the people more powerful than me, and the ones I hoped would be the champions of people like me, are acting blind to what Donald Trump is doing or faking deaf to what he is saying. Thank you Justice Ginsburg for speaking up. Thank you Mr. Butler for your story.	Too many people in powerful positions are turning a blind eye to Donald Trump and his actions.
19140278	Have the Editors of the Times never seen Judgment at Nuremberg? There are times when everyone--even judges--must speak up or live with the consequences of their silence. The optics of the court must be weighed against the dystopia we risk and which the judges in the movie, and at the trials, allowed.	At some point in everyone's lives they are faced with making the choice to speak up or live with what happens from their silence. Judges will always be looked upon and judged by their actions.
19140176	I have to agree with Paul Butler. Trump is a game changer, potentially an existential threat to our democracy and our very being. As he has broken all of the rules of political and social decency, the 'correct' way to respond may no longer be the smart way. Ms. Ginsberg does us a favor i think by getting us to see that yet another important and smart American sees Donald Trump as a very dangerous man.	Justice Ginsberg's comments shows an important intelligent person sees Trump as dangerous.
19140143	Seriously is she prepared to go against the Donald? he has already announced she may have a mental problem. I dont think she should continue as justice if Trump gets in comments like hers would likely interfere with her ability to judge fairly, but this is just another desperate move of the Dems to try to steal the office from Trump.	If Trump is elected, the justice may not be able to remain unbiased.
19137964	Generally a judge should remain aloof and not engage in politics. But please.... Scalia went off on a number of non-judicial review opinions and nobody said boo. Thomas makes speeches that, thankfully, are not well publicized but nonetheless express his opinions. Does the issue of Justice Ginsburg's views amount to a lead editorial in the NY Times and over 472 comments? I think not. On the other hand, expressing disgust for Trump needs to be done. He is a danger to the US and the world. Don't take him lightly. Be careful. In the UK those in favor of Remaining took the Brexiters too lightly and the UK, if it even stays the UK, will regret that for many years.	Supreme Court Justices should be allowed to express feelings in a presidential election in extreme cases. The candidate is dangerous to the US and the world.
19137971	Secular Germans accommodated Hitler during his rise to power by remaining silent. Several of these secular Germans were lawyers, justices and professors. Little did they know that over the course of 10 years - 1935-45, that their Jewish heritage would condemn them and their families, including children to genocide orchestrated by the man they thought would not be able to sway the German people to succeed as Chancellor of Germany. They were wrong. I think Justice Ginsburg has more historic perspective than we care to admit. I don't think, as others have confirmed, that being a Judge precludes one from abdicating one's right to vote and free speech on the candidates that stand for election. Further, if Justice Ginsburg is involved in a case that may present a conflict she would be expected to recuse herself. And that is the more reasonable assessment than the one put forward by the NYT editorial board.	Justice Ginsburg has a good grasp on US history, and should be allowed to voice her opinion in a presidential election. Being a judge doesn't take away their right to vote and their freedom of speech. Ginsberg should recuse herself if she has a conflict with a case.
19137657	Anyone who doesn't speak out regarding this clear and present danger is a coward and no patriot. It's amazing how the GOP ne' fascists want it all their way and whine, yeah verily, squeal, when the Left fails to observe the rules the Right has already trampled. It's just applying Trump-rules. Get over it.	A Supreme Court Justice can denounce a candidate because speaking out is actually courageous. The GOP fascists want everything their way and whine when the left does not observe the rules that the right already trampled.
19136268	Though Justice Ginsburg has broken precedent with her remarks on Trump, she may be recalling a time when people failed to speak out against political leaders frighteningly similar to Trump and the dire consequences that failure lead to not only for the whole world, but most especially for her people. Though in many ways Trump is a buffoon parody of those leaders, the energies he releases and channels are frighteningly similar to the ones they exploited to work their evil. Perhaps recognizing that, she feels this is one of those moments when precedent must yield to the moral imperative to resist evil.	Ginsberg may be recalling people in the past failing to speak out against leaders and the consequences of that. The Supreme Court Justice recognized Trump's harmful energies and felt it was a time when there was a moral imperative to resist evil.
19135848	Ginsburg is well within etiquette..her comments go to Trumps fitness to hold office.....a matter as unlikely to be before the SCOTUS as precedent seems to suggest... she is spot on...except where she divines what her late husband might think.....Resurrection won't be on the SCOTUS calendar ether.	Ginsburg's comments on Trump's fitness to hold office are well within etiquette.
19135629	American citizens have been given the right to voice their opinions. Justice Ginsberg exercised her right as a private citizen. She wasn't operating in her official function. Mr. Trump has won the right to be criticized by all those who disagree with him, just as he has the right to criticize others as he clearly does. There's no news here.	The justice in question's opinions were expressed as a private citizen, not as a court justice.
19135306	The Times Editorial criticizing Justice Ginsburg couldn't be more incorrect. Anyone who doesn't speak up now should forever hold their peace if and when a fascist racist becomes President. She knows the difference between a legitimate candidate and this guy. Speak up. Everyone. Speak up, before it is too late.	Supreme Court Justices should be allowed to voice their opinion in extreme cases.
19134987	Justices are usually picked because of their perceived political bias. Ginsberg's comments are refreshing in a way. She seems to be trying to end the hypocrisy whereby judges pretend they don't have a bias towards one party. If the Court behaves in a partisan manner perhaps we should have direct elections.	It's appropriate for a Supreme Court justice to denounce a candidate because they are selected by members of political parties and are biased. Ginsberg is refreshing showing that she is human and what she stands for, unlike others who pretend they hold no favor.
19134578	The argument here is that Trump is a special case because the professor dislikes Trump A LOT more than he dislikes other Republicans. This is an arbitrary standard which is an unworthy exception to the centuries old rule that judges should be non-political. A SCOTUS justice cannot be partisan and impartial at the same time. RBG should recant or resign.	This is not worthy to be an exception to judges being non-political. Supreme Court justices cannot take part in politics and be impartial.
19129394	In this particular case, in which the American media and most, if not all, Republicans are showing support for Mister Brand Name, I believe it takes a Supreme Court Justice to help a good half of American to listen, listen, listen to what Brand Name has been saying, and promising, for an entire year. I call this 'Condition Red.' Any decent American, in this case, a Supreme Court Justice, who is frustrated with the 'limp noodle' response to Brand Name's snake-oil method of garnishing support and votes, especially the American media, which seems to have ratings the main priority, any straight-thinking adult voter will have recognized the serious danger of a true despot getting this close to our Presidency. Things are backwards. Instead of acknowledging the farce that is Mister Brand Name, pundits, politicians, and others with eyes, ears, and voices not functioning, should be congratulating Justice Ginsberg instead of spouting rules that they, themselves, flaunt every chance they get.	It is important for Americans to hear the opinions of Supreme Court Justices on political events.
19126908	Doo, why wouldn't she also speak out against Hillary when it's been just as documented or even more so, that she is a threat to the United States?. Because it's just an opinion and everyone has one of those. The main threat as I see it is continuing as though everything is ok with the current path we are on. Sad	The justices are allowed their opinions.
19126136	I run this through my own filter, as we have similar backgound, RBG and I. As a jewish person of a certain age and political heritage we have had it pounded into our psyche that to be silent in the time of tyrants is to be damned to be the fool and to have abrogated a responsibility we have to all humanity. I have often thought of moving to New Zealand....and Trump makes me yearn for the years i looked in NZ when Bush won, except this is much worse. New Zealand has nice weather. I only wish Hawaii would leave the union, perfect place to be an ex american. Long live RBG.	We have a responsibility to all humanity to not be silent in the time of tyrants.
19125556	Apparently, everyone needs to see the film Judgment at Nuremberg, based on transcripts of those trials. It is about the trial of a judge and three lawyers who, by either turning a blind eye (the judge) or actively participating with the National Socialists (the lawyers), helped facilitate the legal apparatus of Hitler's Reich. Simply YouTube the judge's (played by Burt Lancaster) astounding speech toward the latter part of the film and you will see that he laments NOT having spoken out when he could sense where things were going. Yes, it is a MOVIE. But it is based on fact - and deals with the rise of the most dangerous demagogue in history (Hitler), for which Trump's rise is an increasingly eerie parallel.	The film Judgement at Nuremberg depicts and supports  a Supreme Court Justice denouncing a candidate. There is a story about a judge and some lawyers who either turned a blind eye or supported Nationalism and it helped Hitler gain power.
19124806	why are we having this discussion . Americans shouldn't be criticizing Justice Ginznerg about anything she says or thinks . All true thinking and caring Americans should feel insulted that she should be placed in this position . What Americans need to be concerned about is that fake and stupid gop presumptive nominee maybe will be our president ! That is the real problem . What a nightmare we have placed ourselves in . When will real truth justice and American way be ours again ? I want justice Ginzberg to speak the truth any time she wants . And that other one who will not be named should just go away .	Thinking Americans should be insulted Justice Ginzberg is being criticized about what she thinks and says. The justice should be allowed to speak their opinion.
19124704	What a joke: he is criticized for questioning a judge's possible bias, and then she discloses she really is biased? Obviously Judges are biased (and many times crooked also). She is living proof! A Judge is not supposed to have a bias, and should be neutral. Pols are expected to be biased. She should resign or be impeached. She doesn't get it.	Supreme Court Justices should not publicly advocate for a party during elections.
19124151	Justices have free speech but it not part of their job to say political views when their primary job is to enforce the law as it is written or nullify a law which in its time may have been just but it is not now. THATS IT! No politics are allowed otherwise you open the door to a political discussion from ALL the justices and you know as well as I that Political opinions are not part of the Justices area of responsibility.	It is not a justice's job to state their political views, it is simply to enforce the law. Supreme Court does not allow politics in actions. Supreme court Justices should not get involved in politics as it is outside their area of responsibility.
19123888	I was always led to believe women did not have balls! Well RBG certainly proves them wrong. She has a perfect right to say what she thinks, being in Government does not mean loosing your rights. Mr Trump is a demagogue and an semi iliterate bully, she did the right thing.	A Supreme Court justice retains her right to free speech.
19124082	I think this is a brilliant essay on the validity of RBG's comments about Trump. To paraphrase Mr. Butler and conflate with a familiar quote: "If not Trump, who? And if not now, when?" There comes a point where decorum, protocol, and tradition have to get left at the curbside of history--if we're going to make any of our own, or have one to talk about in the future. That's what Ginsburg is saying, and that's what Mr. Butler has so eloquently defended.	If we are going to make our own history, sometimes decorum, protocol, and tradition have to be set aside.
19124062	How short is our memory? Some of us still ask where were the judges in 1930s Europe when they might have made a difference shaping our sad history. Judge Ginsburg has not forgotten. Everyone, her included, has the responsibility to remind us of a danger.	Ginsberg has not forgotten people wondering where the judges were in 1930s Europe. It is her responsibility, as it is the rest of ours, to remind us of danger.
19123378	If Trump managed to become President, it will be the fault of everyone who did not speak out - including supposedly people are supposed to remain neutral - like journalists, judges, foreign leaders, even the Pope or the Dalai Lama.	A Supreme Court Justice can denounce a candidate because judges need to be able to speak out in order to prevent someone like Trump from becoming President.
19123261	Trump's candidacy is an incontrovertible sign that the GOP Is in a deep state of dysfunction and disarray. His statements clearly lead to one conclusion: He is a dangerous demagogue in the mold of a McCarthy or a Huey Long. Electing him would endanger our system and open us up an American Putsch. She is entirely right to be alarmed. Anyone with an ounce of sense already is.	Trump's candidacy indicates a state of dysfunction in the GOP.
19123595	It is totally inappropriate for her to comment. It is typical of the left to accept the contravention of norms only when it serves their purposes. Its very clear that the true threat to the rule of law comes from Clinton, not trump. If BG is going to rail against something she should be railing against the above the law abuse of power by the IRS, Clinton and Holders DOJ. Blatant politicization of important institutions which are designed to be apolitical. Thats a threat to our system, not a potential one term president. And by the way, no one has done more to circumvent the law of the people and flout the constitution than our current president.	Ginsberg's comments are inappropriate. The use of a neutral appointment to denounce a political candidate is the real threat to the system.
19122884	The idea of Trump becoming president of the United States is wrong on so many levels that it's impossible to fit it all in a comment. If Scalia or Thomas had made critical political remarks, it would have been treated with a wink and a smile, but OMG a Justice on the Supreme Court who happens to be a woman! They are going to milk that for all it's worth and then some.	Any of the judges could have made critical remarks.
19123173	If only judges in the 1930s had loudly spoken out against fascist politicians and leaders. Now, in the 21st century, when the rule of law itself is under attack, it is their ethical duty to do so. And shame on Professor Gillers, whom I normally hold in high regard.	They have a duty to denounce it since the rule of law is under attack.
19122808	Although this distinguished writer is passionate and not necessarily factually wrong, commenting should be a privilege (commenting on elections, public policy, etc) that all federally elected justices give up when accepting a lifetime appointment to the bench. I thoroughly respect Justice Ginsburg for her views and for her lifetime service, but she is not correct here to insert herself into the election. And if Trump were to reply, that too would be wrong--though he most certainly will defend himself. The point of a lifetime appointment is to shield oneself from the political whims of the day and be above the fray (except in opinions, written from a legal basis and not a popular sentiment), and by now commenting, Justice Ginsburg has blown it.	By assuming the role as a Supreme Court Justice a judge gives up the privilege of commenting on elections and public policy. The Supreme Court justice position is set apart from politics, and thus justices should not participate in politics.
19123421	When I first read Justice Ginsberg's comments earlier today, I was initially surprised that a sitting supreme court justice would give her opinion on a presidential candidate. After reflecting on Justice Ginsberg's comments for a few hours, however, I not only fully agree with them but also think that it is her duty to make her thoughts known to the American people.	Justice Ginsberg's should make her opinion know to American people.
19123384	It's sad to me that the most common defense of her statements appears to me to be, "conservative justices have done it too." Leaving aside whether that is an accurate assessment, the fact is that Justice Ginsburg had an opportunity to set an example of respecting the wall between the judiciary and partisan politics. She chose to further dismantle it.	Ginsburg had a chance to set an example of how judges should stay impartial in politics, but she instead chose to make matters worse.
19122544	Having a viewpoint on a person's candidacy is not necessarily a problem. if a case arises out of the election, she is expected to set those opinions aside to evaluate the law and facts. Justices Scalia and Thomas famously had direct and close ties to the Bush campaign. They deemed the ties to not be problematic in Bush v. Gore. Did anyone really wonder if those Justices supported Bush or Gore (or McCain, or Romney...)? In matters other than elections, Justices certainly and routinely have opinions on matters before a case arises before the court -- for example, many of the justices have written memos or articles or even represented clients on subjects such as affirmative action, or the requisite amount of deference to give an agency.	A standing judge is expected to set aside personal opinion in judgement so expression of opinion is allowed. Ties between Justices Scalia and Thomas were deemed not to be problematic in Bush vs Gore. Justices have more valid opinions because of their jobs.
19123469	Dangerous times call for extraordinary measures. We are at a place in our history where we may elect a man who will do his best to end this great democratic experiment and try to impose a tyranny like the dictators whose virtues he frequent extols and whose methods he clearly admires. Justice Ginsberg is a true patriot who well understands the perils of remaining silent. The other Justices could only enhance their stature and that of the Court by following suit.	The election of a man who seeks to end our democracy and impose tyranny is our current reality. Justice Ginsberg knows it is dangerous to remain silent.
19123010	Justices are asked questions all the time about cases that may come before the Supreme Court. That is where they have to refrain from issuing opinions prior to testimony. Unless someone is planning to take the Republican Party to Court to prevent them from naming Trump as their candidate for president, there is no reason why Justice Ginsburg should not be able to give her opinion. She can always recuse herself should the case actually materialize, but, I doubt very much that 4 members of the court would ever vote to hear whether or not the Emperor really has New Clothes.	Justices have to be careful about giving opinions. Justice Ginsburg should be able to announce her preference for presidential candidate in the U.S. election, unless an opponent of Donald Trump seeks to impede him from the presidency by appealing to the Supreme Court.
19122484	In the Canadian legal system - and I suspect the American one is the same - a reasonable apprehension of bias is considered to be as pernicious as an actual bias. Indeed, the test has always been whether a party can establish the former, and not the latter. While few are so naive as to think that justices have no views, it is incomprehensible to me that a justice would enter the fray this way. It is unhelpful generally, and it is detrimental to the Court. It is unhelpful in that I doubt those who lean toward Mr. Trump place much weight on Judge Ginsburg's views to begin with - so she is unlikely to change anyone's mind (especially considering the widely-held anti-elites sentiment that has become so prominent this year). And it is detrimental to a Court that has struggled so much in recent years to combat the view that the Court is every bit as entrenched and political as the rest of the political system is. Judge Ginsburg has given 40-50% of the people every reason to write her off, which ultimately just hurts the institution.	Obviously they are human and have opinions, but they should not allow those opinions to enter the public forum. It can be damaging to the court itself and it is not really useful. Denouncing is detrimental to the Court because it shows the Court to be political. Ginsburg has given half the people enough reasons to dismiss her.
19120938	Ginsberg definitely has the right to speak truth. Trump is definitely a fascist and we should hear this truth spoken by many more honest folk. Some within Congress speak lies in their support of Trump so why not hear truth spoken ? One lie must be corrected here : Trump is NOT an evangelical as he and others lie about. He is a fundamentalist who thinks he only speaks truth. Clinton may have made a mistake, but Trump IS a mistake and is totally opposed to a true democracy, as are those in Congress who want rule by the NRA and not the people. WE THE PEOPLE must speak out and Ginsberg is brave for speaking truth.	Ginsberg has the right to speak her mind. Ginsberg is brave for speaking out.
19120339	I think the prospect of Trump naming her successor is probably the biggest fear she has. That is why it's so important to defeat him. Three new justices will probably be chosen in the next four years, determining the direction of the court for the next thirty years.	The new justices will determine the direction of the court.
19120270	Scalia used to hold forth in a most partisan manner. Is this somehow different? In a perfect world, SCOTUS justices would never say a word in public about politics. But they do. And we allow it. So get over it.	This is no different than Scalia's partisan behaviors. SCOTUS justices should not say anything about politics.
19120405	Absolutely inappropriate and troubling. In the unlikely event Trump were elected President, he personally, or as chief executive of the executive department, could be plaintiff or defendant in a case before the Supreme Court. In fact, Trump might end up involved in a case before the Supreme Court even if he isn't elected. Germany under the Nazis is a pure example of the infection of a judicial system by political ideology.	Trump, whether elected or not, is likely to be involved in a case before the Supreme Court. Nazi Germany is an example of political ideology infecting the judicial system.
19119656	She has a right to say what she thinks I suppose, but I was disappointed that she would state a desire to flee the country in the face of a Trump presidency. That doesn't show much resolve, toughness, love of country etc., god forbid he wins but we would all need to be strong lest the country devolve into what we have always feared it could whenever we hear the hate spewed by some of our fellow citizens.	A Supreme Court Justice can voice what he or she thinks.
19119090	If any of the dire prediction of a Trump presidency turning into a fascist dictatorship should start to occur, that is the time for the justices of the Court to speak out, in reasoned judicial opinions on actual events. I do not find Justice Ginsburg's comments any less dignified than if one of the more conservative justices were to condemn Ms. Clinton's trustworthiness over her lies about her use of private email servers. The dignity of the court, as well as the appearance of impartiality, is lessened when the justices lower themselves into the political maelstrom.	If the Trump presidency begins to turn into a fascist dictatorship, then the justices of the Court will need to speak out. Justice Ginsburg's comments were no less dignified than an accusation from a more conservative justice. Yes, a Supreme Court Justice can denounce a candidate, but the tenet of impartiality is called into question when a justice does so.
19138566	Ginsburg's statement has no bearing on the separations of powers nor upon how she will consider cases under review, so I do not think what she said was improper. I do not think that Ginsberg did anything inappropriate since she did not in anyway refer to anything that will ever come before the Supreme Court. The Court has no ability to make any judgments that have any effect upon the election of Presidents nor of who is appointed to the Court. Such a personal opinion will never affect anything that is addressed by the Court. If anything, she is stating something which the mass media is ignoring because it's so caught up in the sport of elections to do any relevant analysis of the foreseeable consequences of who ends up as the next President.	Ginsburg's statement does not affect how she will consider cases under review and was not improper. Ginsberg can denounce because there will not be a case concerning the election before the court. The court cannot influence presidential elections or court appointments. A personal opinion will not affect anything addressed by the court.
19136054	It is ridiculous to believe that Justices do not have opinions, vocalizing them or not, about many topics in their thoughts. If thoughts do not impact their professionalism, then spoken words should not. There appears to be nothing to prohibit their speaking about topics of interest to them.	As long as they can do their job professionally, they can denounce. Justices are not prohibited from speaking about topics of interest to them.
19134361	"We want the public to view judicial rulings solely as the product of law and legal reasoning, uninfluenced by political considerations." Even though we know that justices have political considerations and that is usually what gets them considered or nominated to the Court in the first place. The public is not a fool, Professor, and it would be refreshing for you to come down from the ivory tower and look around here at us commoners who daily live with the lies and half-truths of advertising and realize that we know that there is more to a judicial decision than the purity of the law. Moreover, you have to ask how great the crisis has to be for a member of the Court, who knows about keeping silence, to speak out. Remember Joe McCarthy, Professor? Thank god for Joseph Welch, a lawyer, who finally spoke up and discredited him. Ginsberg's brave act was an act of conscience.	Justices have political considerations. Judges use more than the law in making their decisions.
19132869	RBG's opinion of Trump is not a point of law but a measure of her sanity and clarity. Scalia insulted whoever he wanted whenever he wanted to. Trump does not mention opponents without insulting them. Indeed he appears unable to do so. Besides, what if he is a faker?	Ginsberg's opinion of Trump is not a point of law, but rather a measure of her good judgement and sanity.
19128286	besides scalia and thomas up close and personal relationships with major Republicans, including elected officials, i remember when alioto graced the obama state of the union , but sat stoically. he never applauded but did shake his head at some of the president's remarks. inappropriate ? yes. perhaps justice ginsburg should have kept quiet, but what responsible person of influence keeps quiet as a despot marches toward washington?	Responsible, influential persons remain silent as a despot gains power?.
19125772	I, too, am in agreement with those comments on senate confirmation of merrick garland or lower courts appointments. The supreme court should makes his own rules The decision to be political was made by Mitch McConnell and I waited for some admonishment from the court as a whole in a letter. The senators put them in the public arena. So now they have to live with it She didnt comment on ongoing cases	The Supreme Court Justice should make his or her own rules.
19125637	Justices being human, they can't be unbiased, but they must make good-faith efforts to stay so. We need concrete evidence of such efforts: justices crossing ideological lines, justices recusing themselves, justices keeping a distance from potential litigants (such as potential presidents). Instead, we see Justice Ginsburg doing the opposite. Is it any wonder that trust in the Court has ebbed?	Although they are human, justices must make every effort to remain unbiased. Justices need to cross idealogical lines, recuse themselves, and keep a distance from potential litigants.
19124980	The fiction of the court being apolitical is evidenced by innumerable decisions where the court breaks along ideological lines (see: Bush v. Gore). In the case of Trump, demanding that justices should be neutral is like saying the justices should not stop an imminent threat against their person or another citizen --but wait for a case to come before the court. There are some threats that common decency, patriotism and self-preservation demand immediate action. Denouncing the demagogue Trump falls into that category.	the lies of the court. They should not maintain neutrality if the candidate poses a threat to anyone. Sometimes the threat to American values justifies speaking out.
19124575	Ginsburg is a US citizen and is entitled to speak her mind out of court. In this case she protests the presence of a demagogue maniac with no legal or governing experience. We are fools if we do not speak out against this thing called.Triump.	Ginsburg is a US citizen with the right to speak her mind.
19124502	"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." Essential, fundamental, necessary opposition to evil supersedes the compunction of judicial ethics. One need only consider the grave harm that Trump represents to our country and to the human race when weighing the choice of maintaining judicial restraint. Is there a moral requirement to put aside our robes, our membership in a Party, our polite discourse and shout a warning. God bless Justice Ginsburg.	It is more importation to oppose evil than to be judicially ethical. There is a moral requirement when putting aside our robes.
19123367	Why would anyone think that judges are kept out of politics? On many state or country levels they are flat-out elected. The ones who are appointed are often on the receiving end of political reward. Even Federal appointments are political footballs these days, note wellhow many of Obama's picks have been hung out to dry. The grilling that any SCOTUS nom gets is patently political, too - note well McConnell saying that any SCOTUS judge has to pass approval of the NRA. It is imaginary to think that politics are not involved with the judiciary.	Federal appointments these are political in nature, you can see this from the way Obama's choices have been ridiculed. In reality, politics are most definitely involved with the judiciary.
19122355	Justice Ginsburg is old enough to do whatever she wants! A sort of old age privilege available to anybody who has passed their 80th birthday. And Trump is dangerous enough to scare even the devil. Ginsburg did the right thing.	Supreme Court Justices should be allowed to express political opinions. They are entitled to opinions.
19122212	Judges are not umpires. If Mr. Trump acted out in a ball game like he has for most of his life, including calling a judge whom he is before biased due to his heritage, if he had so accused an umpire, he would have been thrown out of that particular game and possibly have his career as a player ended for the good of the game. Mr. Trump campaigns proudly on his scorn for the rule of law (unless it's applied in his favor). How is any jurist not to think him unfit? How is a jurist in her role as citizen not to speak out when Trump casts himself as the enemy of the rule of law?	This isn't baseball. The justice is using her role as a citizen not a judge to speak and Trump is an enemy of law.
19122372	The Chief Justice's analogy to a baseball umpire was terrible then and it's still terrible now. Yes, judges normally call judicial balls and strikes. They accept the playing field as level and then apply the rules to whatever controversy arises between the players. But the whole point of having a Supreme Court is to decide what happens when the playing field isn't level. What happens, for example, when one of the players can't even get inside the stadium because he's black? Or when the players bet on the game? What happens when the game's basic integrity is at issue? That's when Supreme Court justices earn their paycheck, and that's when saying "my job's to call balls and strikes" is a meaningless cop out. All of which is to say, good for Justice Ginsburg for refusing to ignore reality.	Yes, judges call balls and strikes. Yes, the Supreme Court Justice can denounce a candidate but judges need to maintain their impartiality to make sure all Americans are on an equal playing field in the American justice system.
19123333	If Mr. Gillers could explain then how and why it is that judges run for their seats on the NY Supreme Court and are elected by the popular vote after paying set amounts in political contributions to their local party leader, I would be most enlightened. Seriously? Gillers must be joking. Judges have always been political - but that is apart from the reason and logic required to fashion a legal opinion that will stand on the law and survive appeal, as he well knows. Judge Ginsberg has every right to voice her opinion regarding the fitness of Donald Trump for the highest office in the land. And if Trump fears anything it is the weight of any opinion that does not bend in fealty to his psychopathy.	Judges have historically been political. Justice Ginsberg should be allowed to voice her opinion on Trump's ability to perform the duties of the presidency.
19121956	Maybe the senate judiciary committee should not ask such questions either...I applaud her trying to inform the voting public about their responsibility to the republic. Isn't it possible for everyone to have a strong opinion about something and yet make fair decision that are in the best interests of others? I think many parents do that every day. I now know my parents did!	Everyone can have a committed opinion yet have the ability to decide in the best interests of others.
19121821	Gillers' reasoning and the title of his piece don't compute: "The Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges says that judges should not "make speeches for a political candidate, or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office" or "engage in any other political activity." Although this language binds every lower court federal judge, it does not bind the justices. Many who study judicial ethics think it should." If the Code of Conduct doesn't bind the justices, then Justice Ginsburg didn't step over the line. #imwithrbg	The Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges says that judges should not "make speeches for a political candidate, or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office" or "engage in any other political activity."  This language binds every lower court federal judge, it does not bind the justices. The code of conduct is not binding so it does not matter.
19121820	Justice Ginsburg rightly criticized a candidate who has shown no regard for truth, democracy, ethics, or the rule of law. If there is a future, its people will look back and admire the bravery and decency of those, like Justice Ginsburg, who recognized the horror for what he is.	Justice Ginsburg spoke the truth when she spoke out.
19121658	It's naive to think that Justice's political leanings don't affect their decisions. Just look at how closely correlated their decisions are to their appointing Party-with a few exceptions. Better to get their political views out in the open rather than hide them behind some quasi-legal language.	A justice's political views will affect how they decide things. It is better that justices speak openly about their opinions rather than hiding them in their legal statements.
19120565	The code of conduct is a farce -- judges are political animals. They always were and likely always will be. Marbury v Madison shows this. And if anyone had any doubts the blatantly political decision in Bush s Gore proved it when 5 Republican judges put a Republican into the White House.	Supreme Court justices are engaged in politics, and should be allowed to comment on politics.
19120098	NOWHERE did Justice Ginsburg make any political statement whatsoever. She is stating a hypothetical, which is something that happens constantly in courts and in legal discussions every day. Hypothetically, if Trump were elected, she would hypothetically be confused, wish to leave the US and hypothetically wish to live in another country. Now had any judge said, I would advise any sane person to vote against Trump or to remain in the US if he's elected, that would clearly constitute political speech advising others and would most likely be unacceptable. Whether it were legal or not depends on the context. In conversations with family members and close friends, Justices are afforded the same rights of free speech as anyone else. Beyond that, speaking of hypotheticals is the safest choice.	Supreme Court Justices are entitled to opinions too. In conversation, many people say Justices have the right to free speech.
19119721	Justice Ginsburg clearly believes that Mr Trump as President would threaten the rule of law and, in particular, the implementation of the Constitution. Such a risk is more significant than all other concerns raised by Prof Gillers. The view of a person of Justice Ginsburg's learning and experience should be heard on such a grave matter, indeed, in this situation it would be cowardice for her not to speak.	Justice Ginsbers concerns that Trump would threaten the rule of law and implementation of the constitution is more important than Prof Gillers concerns.
19117009	Despite the Code of Conduct to which Stephen Gillers alludes, the political neutrality of the Supreme Court is clearly a fiction. As the most egregious example, does anyone not believe that if the votes in Florida had been interchanged, the votes of the justices in Bush v. Gore would have been interchanged as well? That decision was clearly not "the product of law and legal reasoning, uninfluenced by political considerations." Incidentally, those who think that the Court can function just as well with the current 8 justices as with 9 should contemplate the fact that, had there been 8 justices voting on Bush v. Gore, we would still be wondering who won the election in 2000.	Political neutrality of the Supreme Court does not prevent denouncing a candidate.
19141356	If Justice Ginsburg feels that Trump's candidacy, and potential winning of the Presidency, endangers the rule of law, since he does not follow, or even know, the Constitution, isn't it her duty to speak up? As has been pointed out, Trump already shuts down the access of unsympathetic press. Should he be elected, do you expect him to respect the opposition? In this domain, we have seen during Nixon presidency enough of disrespect for the law.	If a justice feels as though a candidate is breaking rules or laws it is their right to make it known. Unsympathetic press are already shut down by Trump's administration.
19140692	I applaud Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think it will do any good. Logic, truth, and reason have no effect on Trump supporters. They simply dismiss it with "That PC junk doesn't matter." He appeals to their emotions, to emotions that most will not even admit to having: fear of what they are ignorant of, such as Black Lives Matter, Islam, Mexicans, guns (even though most don't even own a gun), and the attacks on Christianity, better know as a separation of Church and State. Trump exploits their ignorance, and thus their fears, masterfully. "I have the answers, and its their fault, not yours (always someone else). Keep doing what you are doing, elect me, and I will take care of it, I promise (you no pain)." We heard that with Reaganomics, and where did that get us?	It won't really help things, but I applaud Justice Ginsburg anyway.
19140254	The Times editorial board confuses political and legal issues in its criticism of Justice Ginsburg. The Supreme Court does not decide political issues. It has based many refusals to consider such issues on its determination that they are political in nature. There is, therefore, no breach of legal ethics when a Justice voices an opinion on a matter of politics. Nothing is more political in nature than the fitness of a candidate to be president, and accordingly, Justice Ginsburg was both within her First Amendment rights as a citizen and the principles of judicial ethics to express her opinion.	A Supreme Court Justice does not decided political issues. A Justice can voice an opinion on politics without breaching legal ethics. Supreme Court justices should be allowed to express political opinions, like any other citizen.
19136080	It is ridiculous to believe that Justices do not have opinions, vocalizing them or not, about many topics in their thoughts. If thoughts do not impact their professionalism, then spoken words should not. There appears to be nothing to prohibit their speaking about topics of interest to them.	People can't believe that Justices don't have opinions. They can still be professional while expressing an opinion. There is nothing to prohibit their speech.
19134503	"The judicial code of ethics says that judges are not to endorse or oppose candidates for elected office. But these provisions do not apply to Supreme Court justices." The judicial code should apply to supreme court justices. A justice can't be both partisan and impartial. RBG has jumped the shark. She should recant or resign.	The judicial code barring judges from endorsing or opposing candidates should also apply to supreme court justices. It is impossible for a justice to be impartial and unbiased.
19122495	What's the big deal? If Justice Scalia could go freely shooting his mouth with acerbic, snide remarks all in jest (!!!), why can't Justice Ginsberg? And what she is saying the truth, a sure disaster waiting to happen should Trump be elected as President. We are lucky to have somebody like Justice Ginsburg. It would be very stupid of us not to take her wise advice.	Why is it a big deal?. Justice Ginberg should be allowed the same freedoms as Scalia was. The Supreme Court Justice was right to say Trump as President of US is a disaster waiting to happen.
19122282	Justice Ginsberg has the right of free speech also. That's the first thing I thought. Her thoughts on Merrick Garland were very appropriate. The Senate refusing to have a confirmation hearing under the Obama administration is an outrage. More than that, not having Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court is a wasted opportunity for our country. If you are acquainted with the legal system, you can appreciate the years of hard work Judge Garland has put in honing his redoubtable intellect. In addition, he has already provided a lifetime of public service. He richly deserves to be on the Supreme Court. The United States would be a better place. Professor Chemerinsky, you were so insightful during bar review, and you are right on target here.	Justice Ginsberg can say what she likes.
19123320	If a Supreme Court Justice truly believes that a presidential candidate is a threat to the Republic, she or he should speak up. Ruth Bader Ginsburg just did that. Every living past Republican president and presidential candidate agrees completely with Justice Ginsburg about Trump. The Republican leaders who have cravenly capitulated to Trump's nomination should be ashamed of themselves. Thank you, Justice Ginsburg!	A Supreme Court Justice if they think a candidate for president is dangerous. All Republican presidential candidates agree with Ginsburg on the matter.
19121924	I loved her comments, I agree with them. I abhorred Scalia, I disagreed with him. These days justices speak in all manner of ways and in all manner of places and with the freedom and force of the first amendment. Get used to it. And get over it.	They are entitled to the protections of the first amendment.
19119010	Just because she has the right to endorse a candidate, that does not make it the right thing to do. There is an intrinsic difference between commenting on judicial opinions already delivered, and attempting to use the power and glory of the Supreme Court to influence an upcoming election. I think that the dignity of the Court is lessened when its members descend into the political arena in such a manner.	Justices can endorse candidates but that doesn't mean they should. There is a difference between commenting on past decisions and attempting to influence an election. The dignity of the Court is lessened.
12019545	I taught for 31 years. I saw people let go or forced to retire, but never were they the worst teachers in the building. They might have been the squeakiest wheels or the least political ones, however. Never the worst teachers. Never.	When I taught for 31 years the people who were fired or forced to retire were not the worst teachers in the building.
12018473	It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course. If it doesn't work, then we will course correct.	Teachers should answer to school boards and parents associations rather than themselves. They get special treatment for the sake of morale.
12017622	In response to people who ask what's different about teaching: Teaching is different from the usual at-will jobs because of the political element. In the absence of job protection, it is very easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, for putting Huckleberry Finn on the syllabus, etc. As for the judge's statement that it takes a decade and hundreds of thousands of dollars to fire a bad teacher, that may be because of a particularly onerous set of state laws in California, but that alone doesn't make tenure as a general principle wrong. Most due process issues are in the union contract terms, not state law, and union contracts are negotiable.	Teaching is a unique job because of the political element I can easily picture states and districts firing a teacher for teaching about anything not currently endorsed by that state. The difficulty in firing a tenured teacher is not a justifiable reason that tenure is wrong. Due process issues are in union contracts.
12017128	Teaching is different from the usual at-will jobs because of the political element. In the absence of job protection, it is easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, etc.	Teaching provides a political element making it different. Without tenure, there are too many little things that teachers could lose their jobs over.
12016295	"In the absence of tenure, teachers may be fired for any reason. " Welcome to the world the rest of us live in! How is it that teaching is the only profession in which performance cannot be evaluated by other people?	Teachers could be fired for any reason without tenure, but that's the way it is for everyone else. Teachers retain their positions because of tenure, not because of successful evaluations.
12015852	"Do tenure's job protections prevent bad teachers from being fired or do they provide for greater stability for low-paid faculty?" It is a myth that teachers are low-paid, at least in the Northeast. In my school District in CT, the average pay of all Board of Ed employees, including teachers, is $60k, and the benefits packages are $20k each. That's $80k in compensation, plus summers off. Plus a handsome pension. That may not be in the 1%, but it sure ain't starvation wages. Most teachers have markedly higher incomes that the taxpayers who are paying their salaries. For wages that high, some accountability is in order.	It is a myth that tenure protects bad teachers. Teachers make more than most, so accountability is necessary.
12013130	Ms Ravitch states that "in the early days of the formation of teacher's unions...". This isn't the early days. There have been a couple of important developments since the early days. One is a body of employment law that protects all workers, including teachers. Second, as in any human endeavor, we've hopefully learned from our mistakes over the passage of time. You cannot achieve the goals of an organization without the focused effort on behalf of the people within the organization and management cannot achieve that effort without the ability to terminate.	Management needs to be able to terminate bad teachers.
12012725	There is nothing in this opinion that explains why teachers need more protections than other civil servants or the private work force at large. There are legal protections and remedies that all employees have against prejudicial firing. We are dealing with public school teachers, not college professors researching controversial topics who might need special protections. The minute number of teachers actually fired for cause speaks for itself. Additionally the argument that reducing tenure will hurt morale might be true for the bad teachers who jobs are at risk. But how do you think the current system affects the moral of good teachers who year after year see the same basket case co-workers keep their jobs. A system that cleared out the dead wood would improve their morale.	There are already ways to prevent unfair firing. While college professors deserve special protections to allow them to continue their research, public school teachers should't be entitled to tenure. Because of tenure, only a very small number of teachers are fired for cause. Reducing tenure will boost morale because good teachers won't see their peers who under preform continue to keep their jobs and equal pay for minimal effort. A system that removed the tired teachers would improve their morale.
12026524	Mr. Petrilli is being dishonest in saying that teachers may simply "sue and often win" if they have been discriminated against or fired for 'arbitrary and capricious' reasons." In fact, without the benefit of negotiated job protections or statutory dismissal procedures, like those overturned in Vergara, teachers may be fired for any number of reasons that are discriminatory or capricious, and completely unrelated to job performance. Is a 39 year old, 15-year teacher costing too much on the salary schedule? Then give them the ax. The ADEA does not apply to employees under the age of 40, even if they are expressly terminated because of age. Did a teacher blow the whistle on an unsavory practice at school, related to their job? Well, under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), that teacher may not have any First Amendment protection for that speech. And gay, lesbian and transgender teachers have no federal protection from discrimination unless and until our Congress passes ENDA. Until then, such discrimination is perfectly legal in many states. Oh, and most obviously, no federal job protections exist for non-discriminatory yet "capricious" firings -- that is at-will employment, the exact end goal for this dishonest author.	Tenure protects teachers from being fired for discriminatory or capricious reasons.
12016993	No, don't abolish tenure, just make it more effective by giving tenure only after 4 or 5 years. Teach principals how to deal with ineffective teachers -- how to document, step up observations and evaluations, how to dismiss teachers who are not effective. The problem is that most principals don't know the difference between good and bad teachers. In my 36 years working in schools I observed that the principal usually praised the teachers who most often agreed with and flattered them. Yes, teachers usually do stay in the same job, maybe not in the same location, and it's a good thing if they do. I worked in 5 different schools over my career and the most effective schools had a good mixture of experienced and new teachers. The experienced teachers helped new teachers with discipline and techniques they had learned over the years. The new teachers added new ideas and new theories of education. Combined, they all made for an excellent school culture. I just wonder how much time Mr. Petrelli has spent in classrooms some he graduated from school?	Some principals don't know good teachers from bad. Teachers perform better when they have stability. Having experienced teachers helps schools be more effective. Older teacher taught new one discipline and techniques.
12014398	What makes teachers so special that they need tenure? There are too many stories of bad teachers being simply transferred or being put on leave before being transferred. If they are lousy, then fire them. There are plenty of people who would take those jobs and crazy benefits (12 months of pay for 9 months of work plus every holiday under the sun). They can't get these jobs because the unions are all about who you know, whether it's teaching in a nice town, or trying to get a job at the docks. The whole notion of seniority over skills is nonsense as well. If you're good at your job, you get to keep it.	Bad teachers can be transferred or put on leave rather than simply fired. Teacher unions use tenure to keep the connected in jobs just like all other unions. Using seniority as any kind of rating in a job that should go to the most skilled is nonsensical.
12014246	Tenure was never intended to protect incompetent teachers. Tenure was intended to be the necessary protection for teachers who give their professional (or political) opinion. In states where teacher tenure is abolished, it is replaced with the policy that a principal or superintendent may dismiss a teacher at the end of a school year without having to give a reason or any justification whatsoever. This system creates yes-men and women -- zombies who do exactly as told and live in fear of giving an honest, professional opinion on what may be considered by some to be the curriculum or program that administrators tout as being the ultimate answer to education reform. Who would take that risk?	Tenure gives protection and stability to teachers. Tenure allows teachers to perform their jobs better.
12013181	Yeah, about what I expected from Petrilli. An attempt to seem reasonable by minimizing the problems with his position and overstating the benefits. Yes, an arbitrarily fired teacher without tenure can sue, and might possibly collect... IF he or she can afford a lawyer, and IF he or she can make it through years of litigation without a job. Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so. It's stupidly simple: tenure is basically a law that says teachers, after several years of service, need to be informed of the reason they're being fired and given a chance to respond to those accusations. Despite a lot of really misleading claims, that's really all it is. And since that system protects good teachers and allows the firing of bad ones, nobody who understands it (and wants the best for kids) will oppose it.	Tenure assures that only bad teachers are fired. The tenure process only requires a reason to be required for firings and a chance to respond against those accusations. Tenure allows for protecting the good and firing the bad teachers.
12017871	To Nora: Yes, there plumbers, lawyers, etc. who are not so hot. They, though, are not responsible for educating our children, yours and mine, and everybody's. I was so fortunate enough to have really good teachers. In the day, our school district was highly respected and standards were high. It was important to our state legislators, too. Now....not so much.	Our school district used to be highly respected, with high standards.
12016397	There seems to be a misconception that teachers are automatically granted tenure the first day they arrive on the job. When I began teaching, it took 3 years and six classroom observations per year to be granted tenure. Shouldn't that be enough time for an administrator to recognize whether a teacher is competent?	It took me 3 years and 6 classroom observations to get tenure.
12014464	Finland's schools which are highly touted for their stellar performance depend on highly unionized teachers who have tenure. Young teachers, especially in the most challenging urban districts need support and mentoring. The high turnover rate will only get higher if this new ruling prevails. Administrators and school districts in general need to provide ongoing support for new teachers in the form of mentors, aides, and constant feedback. It's a difficult job.	Teachers in Finland are unionized and students perform well. Tenure provides increased stability for young teachers. Schools need to provide mentors and aides to new teachers, if the new ruling prevails the turn over rate will go up.
12013086	In order to attract and retain people to teaching, they need to have some positive benefit in the profession. When the top 25 hedge fund managers make more money than all the nation's kindergarten teachers combined, you know teachers aren't well paid. The only thing they have is the assurance that they can't be fired on a whim. There is a trade-off between salary and security, and taking one away without increasing the other is going to bleed the profession still further.	Tenure is needed to keep teachers, it is a positive reward. Tenure makes up for the lack of monetary compensation to teachers. Teachers only have the assurance that they can't be fired on a whim. The security of tenure is necessary to compensate for the low salary of teachers.
12011066	"K-12 teachers with tenure do not have a job for life. What "tenure" means, for them, is due-process procedures for dismissals with cause, instead of capricious or at-will dismissal from their duties." If that were the case, then I don't think the union busters like Welch would have such an easy time finding popular support. Most thoughtful people would support tenure if it did simply mean due process. But it is so hard to dismiss bad teachers and children's educations suffer. Dismissing all protections isn't fair, but the teacher's unions brought this upon themselves by refusing to entertain any flexibility with regard to evaluations and dismissals.	Tenure allows for teachers to have rights against dismissal. People would support tenure if it were simply due process. Do not dismiss all protection.
12020680	This guy must live in Lake Woebegone if he thinks that "replacing the poorest performing 5 to 8 percent of teachers with an average teacher" is a statistically valid procedure. At any rate, there is no data on, or even a well defined definition for, the grossly ineffective teachers that this court ruling and this writer mention. The 'school reformers' will not stop until schools have been reformed into a private business, and this should be viewed as nothing more than a salvo in that war.	The real aim of the opposition to tenure is to make public schools into private businesses.
12019731	Tenure does not mean a teacher cannot lose their job. It requires due process before termination. Before tenure is achieved, a teacher can be fired without due process. In the Atlanta School District administrators, fearing that low test scores would cost them their jobs, instructed teachers to change student test responses. Without tenure and due process, teachers risked being fired if they didn't follow instructions.	Those who have not yet achieved tenure can still be easily dismissed. Teachers have been instructed to change student test responses due to administrators' fear of losing their jobs. Tenure provides stability so that teachers can freely express their views and create their own way of conducting their classrooms.
12015274	As an ex school board member in Calif i was always so frustrated that getting rid of a poor performing teacher was impossible. Even tho they actually drank during school hours, fell asleep at their desk they were untouchable. We had to bargain with bonuses and increase retirement to get them out.We were not allowed to monitor their classes. Yes, the systems out of control and yes their are many who lost interest in teaching and hang on for years for their retirement.	I was frustrated being a board member in California. Tenure allows for teachers who drink on the job or fall asleep at their desks to bargain for bonuses and increased retirement in order to get rid of them. Tenure allows bad teachers to remain in place with unevaluated performance. Many of them lost interest in teaching long ago and only continue for the retirement.
12014627	"Teacher tenure, and the related onerous and costly requirements for dismissing an ineffective teacher, have evolved into a system that almost completely insulates teachers from review, evaluation, or personnel decisions that would threaten their lifetime employment." This is the old trope long used by school administrators, and it's really a red herring. "Related onerous and costly requirements" -- really?!? It is the job of administrators to develop and carry out teacher evaluations, mentor them if they need it, and remove them when they deserve it. It is the fact that they do not do their jobs in this regard that "almost completely insulates teachers from review, evaluation, or personnel decisions." I hope readers can see through Hanushek's specious arguments and see it for the drivel it truly is. Obviously the judge in southern California couldn't.	Teachers are safe from review. Administrators should be able to monitor teachers performance, and fire them if necessary.
12013230	Everytime Hanushek mentions research, watch out. The research he manages to find always seems to reinforce his preferred narrative, no matter how little it resembles reality. Back in reality, tenure is basically a rule that allows the firing of bad teachers while prohibiting the firing of good ones. Like any rule implemented by human beings, it can be derailed by incompetent supervisors, but the rule itself doesn't protect bad teachers. It protects good ones. Ending tenure doesn't make it any easier for a competent administrator to fire a bad teacher, but it DOES make it easier for an incompetent administrator to fire a GOOD teacher. Hanushek is rarely on the right side of issues, and he doesn't surprise here.	Tenure allows the firing of bad teachers and prohibits the firing of good teachers. Ending tenure would make it easier for an incompetent administrator to fire a good teacher.
12009673	Who is the judge? I was an early childhood teacher in NYC for 30 yrs, and continuously improved my skills and creativity. I was in 4 different schools and in all that time I had only 1 supervisor whom I would think understood what I was doing. They did not know that I still have a file of letters from parents and student teachers thanking me for all I did for the children. But I returned to 1 school, and the principal was delighted. But he made the mistake of not informing the ass't principal. From the 1st day of school she harassed me in many ways.I am not talented in rebuffels and the prin. said it was not in his jurisdiction to interfere.she kept it up. She won. I retired. The teachers had the 1st end of year party in 8 yrs. just to honor me. I think that in the 1st 3 yrs of teaching bad teachers can be identified and dismissed before tenure; good teacher should be protected from bad supevisors and sheer personal pettiness.	Tenure prevents bad teachers from being weeded out early in their career.
7650597	How can anyone, German or Greek, think this is going to get better! I have total confidence in both peoples ability to solve their own individual problems, as long as each is in control of their sovereign self... not the EU... the definition of idiocy is doing more of the same thing and expecting a different result...	Nations can solve their problems as long as they are in control of their sovereign selves rather than the EU.
7638757	The system is out of balance, and it's the national industries with their very different output levels which thrives this diversion. There is a lot of tax-payer money which is trying to counter this, but the money, which is on account of the governments are just peanuts. The german industry is steamrolling the rest of europe, and for this devastation everyone has to pay, first of all the german tax-payers. Just look at france, their demise is now on the lever. Where should this end ? A few countries with a workforce of 50 Mio is liable for producing the need of 350 Mio citizen ? But the main problem are political and social issues. This is a conundrum, the moral hazard - unlike the US every country is liable for their own efficiency. Germany can try to drag along the rest of europe, but one reason for a success is our global competitiveness and we may fail to maintain this - to say the european economy as whole has rightly become global insignificant.	The Euro is out of balance; diversion thrives when industries within nations have different levels of output. Germany is trying to advance since the European economy does not have a significant impact.
7644790	Why are the Euro-zone members so reluctant to call it quits? It was a noble experiment, it had to be tried, but it failed miserably. Why keep punishing ordinary Europeans in order to save a fatally flawed idea? Let it go. Each country must return to individual currencies. Not doing so will lead to greater and greater misery which in turn will lead to violence and loss of life. It's not worth it. Time to admit that the elite economists and politicians failed Europe. Now the people of Europe must take back their lives. Get rid of the Euro and all the hateful feelings it has engendered in what had been a remarkably peaceful and prosperous group of nations.	The Euro is not good for Europe or Germany because the idea is flawed. All EU members should abandon the Euro. If they don't abandon the Euro they will be creating violence and loss of life.
7638928	Germany leaving the Euro now? hardly fesible given the enrmous costs involved. The Greeks, Portuguese and to some extent the Italians have been forced to make sometimes debilitating cuts just to keep the union. If Germany exits, the resulting depression will once again bring to the fore the ultra nationalists in many states and no one can predict the resultant chaos that will inevitably follow. For the time being germany ie well trapped in the euro until the crisis ebbs and then the argument to separate may in all probability ebb away also	It would not be economical to abandon the Euro. Germany exiting the Euro would cause depression and nationalism in other states, resulting in chaos.
7638699	Germany to remain in the currency union is a MUST. Period. Germany has to give Southern Europe guidance - and not just fresh money. Ultemately Europe is a Schicksalsgemeinschaft that is a firm community of members sticking together in mutual loyality.	It is important that Germany keep the Euro. Germany needs to stay with Europe to guide them and help, not just for financial reasons.
14256738	My wife was considered low risk. It was our second child, and the delivery went fine until she started bleeding after the placenta came out. After a few days in the ICU she was fine, but if she had the delivery at home she'd be dead right now. Is there a way to judge the risk of problems before labor? I have no idea. However, if something does happen during labor and delivery it'll happen fast, and wouldn't you rather be in a place that's prepared to deal with emergencies?	Women may experience problems, such as heavy bleeding, during birth. Complications with one delivery at home could have resulted in death but was easily mitigated in ICU. Home is a familiar place if an emergency does happen.
14253310	I had an intervention-free hospital birth with my first daughter and a home water birth with my second daughter. Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Why would we think that we need to be in a hospital, surrounded by strange germs, impersonal nurses/obs when we could be in our own home trusting the power of our body. It is time women learn to trust in their bodies, stay low risk through diet and exercise, and research research research. We do not have to be afraid of what our bodies were made to do. With the supervision of an experienced midwife, trained in natural birth, home births are safer than hospital births.	Giving birth is something women have been doing since the dawn of time. Hospitals are unfamiliar environments. In order to attain optimal health, women need to educate themselves, diet and exercise. Home birth is a natural event. Homebirths with proper supervision are safer than hospital births.
14233179	It is certainly anecdotal but my son was delivered by a midwife in a birthing center and my daughter by midwife at home. Neither was a problem, nor were either at any risk. If nothing else home births would reduce the incidence of unnecessary c-sections, which is the real scandal here.	Both of my home births had no problems or risks. It would not be so convenient to do C-sections for births that take place at home.
14229849	I find this answer scaring to the utmost extent. I am a 33 year old mother, and had two absolutely perfectly normal pregnancies. I am very healthy. I delivered my two girls with the least interventions (no drugs or other interventions). Every single thing the doctors did, I was asked first... Except... my second daughter was entangled in her cord. The doctor immediately helped her out with vacuum. Today, she has no lesions or side effects. I wonder and do not want to consider what would have happened in a home birth. Overall, I found the providers extremely amenable and willing to do anything to accommodate for me (the mother)... except, when my baby's life was at stake, and they did what they could do provide a safe birth. Exactly what I wanted.	Writer had daughter with entangled cord and the doctor was helpful. Women should not have kids at home, I have found that hospital staffers are willing to meet my needs and comfort me,but they were also available when my baby's life was at stake and did the best for a safe birth.
14227993	Here's the deal with home birth as opposed to hospital birth. From this essay, "Life-threatening emergencies that are not predictable are extremely rare - although they do occur both at home and in the hospital at roughly equal rates." So when a life-threatening emergency occurs at a hospital, the mother and baby have a pretty good chance of surviving it, or as good as possible anyway. When such occurs at home, the odds are good that the mother and/or baby will die. So home births are less safe. They're usually safe, sure, because these emergencies are rare. But they're less safe than hospitals and always will be.	Life threatening emergencies are rare and unpredictable, but occur at home and in the hospital at equal rates. Mothers and babies have a better chance of surviving emergencies in a hospital. It is much more dangerous. It may be less sage to have a baby at home. Even if home births are usually safe, they will always be less safe than hospitals.
14229819	How large is the (significant) difference between outcomes for a baby born at home and one born in the hospital? And, is it due to the inclusion in this data of incompetent midwives? I have known several women who gave birth at home, and wished to do so myself, but couldn't because of complications. My experience of birthing in a hospital with a male resident was quite unpleasant. He touched me and examined me without asking my permission. He said my membranes had not broken and I was urinating. Every woman who has experienced membranes breaking knows the difference. A woman/midwife wouldn't have done/said these things this. Childbirth is difficult enough without unempathic male doctors.	Women who can give birth at home should have the choice. For some, a hospital birth can be an unpleasant experience. Homebirth could provide a more empathic place to birth children than a hospital.
14228063	Then why is it studies have found lower infant and maternal mortality rates in countries where over 30% of all births are home births? Why does the US rank lower than some third world countries when it comes to mortality rates? That is not junk science, it is a fact. Home birth is safer for those who are healthy.	There are lower infant and maternal mortality rates in places with higher percentages of home births. Home birth is safe for healthy women.
14224040	These obstetricians condescendingly say they even "have a midwife teach our residents at NewYork-Presbyterian. " This is like the racist or homophobe who says "I have a Black friend / Gay cousin". These men make their living by insisting that birth requires hospitalization and surgical intervention, so their opinions are not without bias. Anyway, all three of my children - the youngest is 31 and was born at home with a nurse midwife attending- are doing nicely. Thanks for your concern, doctors.	The author birthed three children at home safely.
14233480	These anti-homebirth rants have been going on since I had my four homebirth babiss some 20-32 years ago. And the infant and mother mortality figures are still among the worst in industrialized nations for U.S. hospital births. There is no queestion that prenatal care from a midwife is superior to that of any obstetrician and that alone makes for a safer experience for mother and child.	Hospital births have high mortality rates. Midwives are better at prenatal care than doctors.
14230144	This is a wonderful article. I have had 3 births, the first 2 were in the hospital, and my 3rd was at home. I had awful experiences in the hospital with feeling like my freedom was taken away. I felt like I was shackled to the bed from the moment I walked in. My home birth was by far the best decision I have ever made. The experience is almost indescribable. Don't get me wrong, my first 2 births are special to me only because it was the moment my beautiful children came into this world. I just wish I knew then what I know now. With my home birth, I had an absolutely wonderful midwife who monitored me, but also aloud me to have control and let my body do what it was meant to do: give birth. Pregnancy is not a sickness, and I refuse to allow it to be treated as such.	My experience at the hospital was negative and felt forced. The hospital environment made me feel like I was a prisoner from the start. My home birth experience is indescribable, it was the best decision I ever made. Having a birth at home with a qualified midwife allowed me to have control of the birthing process in a natural and comfortable manner. Being pregnant shouldn't be treated as if it were an illness.
14230061	The solution to the risks posed by hospitals is not to move procedures into the home, but to aggressively work on reducing the risks and improving hospital settings. No one would have a triple bypass in their living room just because they are more likely to get an infection in the hospital. The risk of infection is being addressed: a major campaign in many hospitals has successfully reduced the risk, and that is the right direction. Move forward, not backward.	Instead of having children at home, hospitals should work to improve their services and environment. There is no grounds for avoiding the hospital for a major medical event in order to avoid infection. Women should not be encouraged to give birth at home because the risk of infection is greater at home than in hospitals.
14224168	Another male obstetrician with scare tactics designed to intimidate women from having their baby at home. Women with high-risk pregnancies know they need to deliver in a hospital and may need surgical intervention. Many women do not. Saying "We can do a better job of bringing the comforts of home into a controlled birth setting" shows he just doesn't get it. It's not about painting the walls of the delivery room a pretty color or having rocking chairs in the room. It's about informed and healthy women in control of their birth choices. Let us be clear, this guy's lifestyle is based on insisting that women deliver in hospital attended by a surgeon. So his opinion is not unbiased.	Women should be allowed to birth at home because they will be in charge of their health choices. This person wants to insist women have babies in a hospital with a surgeon.
17760020	The I believe the Kurds are fighting for survival both in Syria and Turkey. Most of the Kurdish fighters are Christians and are being targeted by Isis. Syria has become no-mans-land, and the Kurds are fighting to gain territory as well. I don't think the United States should be focus on the estranged relationship between the Kurds and Turkey. But rather work with the Kurds since that's the only option and reliable friend the United States have in this crises.	Kurdish fighters are also being targeted by ISIS. The US should not divide the Kurds and Turkey. The US should work with the Kurds in Syria because no other reliable ally exists there.
17679809	Kurds are very reliable ally of United States in the Middle East. They do not have any connection with any extremist Islamic group and they are the only group that have been fighting against Isis consistently. In other hand Turkey not only allow many cihadists to use their border to join Isis but also support extremist group in Syria in order to remove the Essad from the power. Turkey never committed to fight against Isis. It allowed US to use its air base last year against Isis but they decided to use that opportunity to bomb Kurdish territories both in Syria and Iraq. How Us can relay on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is using his power to get rid of democratic society. There are many journalists in jail, 1028 academicians were charged because they signed a petition to invite Turkish government to have a peace in southeast Turkey. Us should support Kurds not unreliable Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.	The Kurds make good Syrian allies because they are not extremist and have always fought ISIS.
17686396	I see a trend here. A series of Turkish supporters of the islamofascist AKP party of Turkey who are paid by the Sultan (Erdogan) to discredit the Kurds and harness support for the now Islamic Republic of Turkey (the Sunni version of Iran). This is of course not a big deal in the Middle East and I wouldn't expect anything else from the major media outlets based in that region. However, little did I know that NYT would allow for these AKP trolls to be published on the platform of such a respected site. Whatever these trolls say, and whatever the mainstream media wants to spam people with, the truth will remain the same: 1. Turkey has left their 50 year old history of secularism and gone back to their 1000 year history of radical islam to re-establish the Ottoman Empire. 2. The Kurds are one of the few people in this region who are Western-oriented and wish to establish a democratic pluralistic society. For this, Western powers should step away from the status quo that has brought nothing but civil war and what seems to be a perpetual low-grade conflict and instead support an independent Kurdistan.	In Syria Kurds are allies. The Kurdsare good allies because they are the only sgroup in Syria who want to establish a westernized democracy.
15334924	If we really thought that these kinds of bans can work, then we should ban any establishment that serves alcohol from having a parking lot, and in fact why not go farther and just not issue a liquor license to any establishment that you can only realistically get to and from by car. These things aren't going to happen of course, which is the point.	Why not just ban liquor in places where you can drive or park?.
15338259	In my late 20s, I used to go to happy hours a few times per month related to various social or professional orgs I was part of, or just to meet with friends. Now, when I leave work around 5:30, I pick up my child from day care and head home to get dinner ready. Every single day. Ah, would that the happy hours could come again!	Many people go to happy hours a few times a month for various social orgs or just to meet with friends. States should provide happy hours again.
15332663	I agree that the bartenders are what makes a good social Happy Hour interesting and enjoyable. We have all witnessed historically what happened during prohibition when the government deemed alcohol evil and a family wrecker. Bans do nothing but encourage the forbidden behavior, it's in our social DNA. Maybe the law makers should focus on the title: Happy Hour. An hour is 60 minutes and most places I've seen Happy Hour extends from dawn to way past dusk. How about a Last Call for the Happy Hour title not the event?	We have already seen that historically, prohibition does not end well. Our social DNA makes us want to perform banned behavior.
15344547	Hollow argument. I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few. The answer is to limit the number of alcoholic beverages per person during happy hour. It would be a good idea at sporting events too, but the team owners and concessionaires would never allow that.	People can use public transit systems during happy hour. Happy hour is just that happy times and great money. Most people are not irresponsible. The number of beverages per person should be restricted instead.
6537714	We love taking our kids on vacation to foreign countries. TV and internet are just not adequate substitutes for actually being there to experience another people and culture. They learn to put up with the uncertainties and the unexpected (good or bad) that come with being in an unfamiliar environment. They learn to stay calm, to ask for help, to communicate without speaking the local language, to go with the flow and see what happens. It's great if you can afford it. One thing to keep in mind when planning a trip with kids -- Don't be too ambitious. Don't try to cover 4 cities in a week. The adults will remember the sights, but the kids will remember the frenetic packing and unpacking. So, pick a city and make it your base. Explore that city and stay a while. If you have time, make day trips.	Children need to experience other people and cultures. Family vacations teach children to handle uncertainties and unexpected happenings in an unfamiliar environment. Kids on vacation learn to be calm, and communicate when you don't speak the language and go with the flow.
6537087	When our kids were little, we made the obligatory trip to Disneyworld, but we coupled that with a trip to the Kennedy Space Center to watch a shuttle launch. We also took them on a driving tour of New England to see things like Mystic Seaport, Plimouth Plantation and Salem. When they got older we took them to the Grand Canyon, Europe and Japan, but they helped plan our vacations and so we made side trips to Meteor Crater and Legoland in Windsor. The kids are now grown and living in different states, but they still ask to take family vacations with us. These trips a good way to reconnect, but it is also clear they have given our kids first hand knowledge and real appreciation of the wider world.	Vacations are a good way for parents and children to connect, but it also gives children knowledge and appreciation of the world.
6540450	In 1959 or so our family took an epic car trip around New York State and Connecticut. My brother, sister, and I still talk about that trip - good memories. My wife and I always took our kids on vacations. We all had a great time and I hope that their memories of these trips is as fond as ours are. Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family. "In the long run, the cost was nothing - but think of the fun we would have had!"	My family took a trip around New York State and Connecticut, and it was epic. My family took our kids on vacations and had a great time. Vacationing with kids is worth the cost.
6539424	I have very very happy memories of family vacations with the kids- and would not change those for the world. Perhaps the difference is the kids were well behaved? From looking at these posts, it seems alot of parents are extremely anxious to get away from their children. I think getting away for a romantic weekend sans children is great- but for big 2 week summer vacations, I would find it unthinkable to go without the children and to have them miss this experience. I would think this sends a message to the kids that you really don't like them very much- perhaps theyre right.	I have good memories of family vacations with my children. Family vacations create lifelong memories. If you do not vacation with children, it could lead them to believe that they are not loved by their parents.
6538888	When a couple decides to have children, the children become an integral part of the family and should not be excluded from family adventures unless a child has so severe a disability that he or she cannot go. We rarely took vacations, but when we did it was as a family. Now that our children are grown and all moved away, we seldom see them, so those together times have become even more precious. Children grow up so fast--enjoy them as much as you can. Carve out time for yourselves by enforcing an early bedtime for the offspring.	Children should not be excluded from vacations because they are part of the family. Childhood does not last forever enjoy all the time you can.
8839462	When NATO was first formed in response to the Cold War Soviet threat, General Eisenhower said, "If we're still here fifty years from now, this will have been a failure." It wasn't a failure, but did take more than 50 years." The existing NATO should have disappeared with the end of the Cold War, but should be replaced by a more flexible organization with an equality of cost sharing relative to more equal contributions. The US needs to stop paying much of everyone else's share. Goodbye to all the tax-free bureaucrats and non-defense committees which reside in Brussels and help make it so expensive.	NATO was formed during the Cold War Soviet threat, we shouldn't still need it now if it has been successful. NATO should be disbanded and replaced with a more modern organization. The share for many members of NATO is paid by the US.
8837737	Europeans might not like to hear it but the US presence has allowed them to skimp on their own defence and for the first time in history forget about fighting each other. No prizes for guessing what will happen when the US does leave (as it must).	US presence has caused other members to slack on their defense.
8842255	In Europe, France and Britain have nuclear weapons. The industrial and financial driver of the continent, Germany, does not. That might not bode well for future stability. There is always the possiblity of nationalist revanchism. While the USSR is gone, Russia's strategic interest in a relatively disarmed Germany is most likely not. Having the US pull out of NATO at this point--where all appears stable for the time being at least--without having a final resolution of the armaments issue, seems less than fully prudent.	NATO has provided stability but it would be unwise to unwind NATO when armament issues remain unresolved.
8841900	For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems	NATO was once about defending Western Europe from the Soviet Union. Post WWII, Germany was weak and divided. NATO ended when Germany reunited and the Soviet Union collapse. NATO is an organization without a purpose. It keeps getting involved in questionable areas in the Middle East. The USA should withdraw its military and money from Europe immediately.
8841921	We keep NATO, because we have been fighting the peace since we won the war. A large group with a clause of 'an attack on a member is an attack on all' is a formidable group, that can deter attacks, just based on the thought of the large group attacking back. A bully tends to step back when confronted with a group willing to defend itself.	NATO has helped us keep peace since the Cold War. The threat of getting an entire group involved in an attack on one member is a powerful deterrent. A bully retreats when challenged.
8840022	I would assume that the only group opposed to our leaving NATO are those element of the military industrial complex that profit financially from our continued participation. Beyond the savings in dollars, there are two significant advantages in doing so. First, it would trend against the reality of empires falling as a result of overextending themselves militarily, and second, it would go a long way toward bringing Russia back into the community of European nations, ending a major source of Russian paranoia. Unfortunately, this move makes so much sense that it is unlikely the present congress would entertain it.	There are many advantages of ending it, including saving money. Disbanding NATO would improve relations with Russia.
8838057	NATO's decline is irreversible. It serves no European defence needs at all. From time to time it may involve itself in some US Imperial adventure. Or provide cover for some latter day petty European Imperial foray into Africa. There is no Russian threat at all. And no prospect of using NATO as a backstop in the US pivot to confront the inexorable rise of China. Indeed for Europe there is no Chinese threat unless Russia joins a Chinese axis. And in this case NATO is unlikely to be an adequate tool for the brave new world. such an alliance would portend. NATO serves the interests of the US regime and consequently they must bear the financial costs. If the US government doesn't want to pay the bill let it leave. What keeps the US paying is not some positive commitment to democracy,human rights or the American way it is (and quite obviously) fear. The fear of being on your own with only the Israeli government to act as your friend in need.	NATO should be disbanded because the end is inevitable. NATO does nothing for European defense. Russia is not a threat. There is no Chinese threat to Europe.
8838287	Amen. Entangling alliances may be necessary when there is an existential threat to national survival (Hitler & friends, expansionist Warsaw Pact), but there is no such threat now. It is not our job to police the world, resolve conflict in the Middle East, or protect Europe -- which can look after itself just fine in a way that it could not immediately post WWII. Attempting to enforce some sort of Pax Americana is not our responsibility, nor is it our right, and we reap more resentment than peace when we act as if it is.	NATO was useful when the world was at war and alliances had to be formed to defeat a common enemy, but today there is no threat and no need for this. The world is more stable now than post WWII, and no longer needs NATO. Enforcing a Pax Americana is not our right or responsibility and it leads to more resentment than peace.
16807537	It is impossible to get a good sampling from polls. Poll takers are like telemarketers; they invade the privacy of our homes, especially when we are busiest. If I answer the phone at all, I am apt to be less than polite to the person who is bothering me. I have strong political opinions but the poll takers will never hear them because I don't want to answer a stranger's probing questions. What kinds of people are being sampled? I am not alone in my feelings about intrusive phone calls, so it is none of us. Although I have had a few illegal calls on my cell phone, those without landlines are not included in most samples. The skewed sampling is giving greater weight to the candidate whose fans are willing to be bothered by a poll. What does that say about his qualifications for the job of president? Nothing.	Polls do not provide a good sampling. Pollers are invasive. People aren't open and honest with pollers. Skewed sampling is giving greater weight to the candidate whose fans are willing to do a poll. Does it say anything about his qualifications for the job of president? Nothing.
16803626	I would tend to agree: Poll results (no matter how ill formed the poll questions) create a public narrative that exists outside of any rigorous definition of reality. This is very much like the artificial Red State / Blue State divide, when in fact most states are clearly purple. But polls tell us Texas is full of tea party nuts, and Massachusetts the lair of well meaning but totally impractical socialists and Harvard pontificators. And ne'er the twain shall meet. This is, of course, a dangerous way to conduct public dialogue, and I lay a lot of the blame on the press, which refuses to call the idiocy of some of these polls out. The fourth estate needs to step back and find some voices of reason.	Polls results create a public narrative rather than reality. Polling is not a good way to create public opinions.
16804124	This is sad: basically, the argument presented here is that public opinion polls help our representatives understand how we feel on a particular issue. The truth is, politicians use poll results to craft their campaign rhetoric - and once elected, ignore the polls and focus on the needs of the powerful which they obtain at dinner parties, on the golf course and through lobbyists. Just look at the numerous polls showing broad public support for policies which the rich veto: a national health plan, increased Social Security benefits, increased taxation of wealth, ending austerity etc.	Pollings give a since of idea where the majority lies, keeping the promise is sometimes more difficult. Take a look at the various polls.
4864494	I found Professor Brennan's view elitist and arrogant. He has been fortunate enough to have had an education and now sits in judgement on those whom he perceives as to stupid to vote, and as he politely intimates would spoil his nice little educated democracy. Mandatory voting does not mean you actually have to vote, it just means you have to attend the polling booth on election day. As Eric Walk (17) mentioned many citizens have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that you have that privilege, is it too much to ask that those enjoying the benefits of that sacrifice show their respect on election day by participating in what is and has been fought and died for, regardless of your level of formal education. Would Professor Brennan suggest that those in the armed services are also of a similar level of intelligence? Or is it alright that those who belong to the lowest socioeconomic group in the US continue to do the lion's share of the fighting and dying for his right to vote as has been the case since the Vietnam War.	You should at least have to attend the polling booth on election day. Many citizens have fought and died for our right to vote, and those enjoying those benefits should respect that and vote, regardless of formal education.
4859942	Awesome! While I understand the outrage shown in half of the comments, I really do agree with Prof Brennan. Running a country (or state or city...) is hard. Everyone *should* vote. But if someone is voting for one candidate only because "the other guy is black", or some other superficial reason, then I think they really should NOT be voting. We need to make informed choices to make the country (or state or city) better for all of us.	I don't think people should be voting if they are voting for superficial reasons. Citizens planning to vote should inform themselves to make the country, state, or city better.
4839700	Wow. Go live in Bahrain, sir, please. We are trying to have a democracy, here. How do we test the rationality or intelligence of our voters? With a questionaire? Things like, "Is man-made climate change real?", or "Evolution: Fact or Myth?" How about, "Was Saddam Hussein behind the attacks of 9-11?", or "Will tax cuts for the top 1% trickle down to the rest of us?" Should people driven by irrational, supersticious beliefs be barred from voting? The goal must be participation and trustworthy results. Not only should voting be mandatory, but citizens should have a week to cast their votes and the federal government, not partisan state cabals, should be responsible for the electronic voting machines.	Participation and trustworthy results should be the goal. Citizens should be given a week to cast their votes, and the voting process should be managed by the federal government.
4838715	An impolite and un-PC analysis, perhaps, but unfortunately it is also an accurate one. I used to push everyone I knew to vote, until I realized that someone who sees no value in voting is exactly the sort of person I *don't* want determining the future of my country.	Voting ought not be mandatory because if someone doesn't see value in voting, I would rather not see them determining the country's future.
4845710	Contrary to popular belief, there is no mandatory voting in Australia. Adults are required to attend a polling station, to produce identification, and to have their name crossed off the electoral roll. They are then handed voting slips but there is no requirement to fill them out or submit them, or to submit a valid vote. This system ensures that no-one is forced to vote if they do not wish to, but also ensures that the barriers to participation are removed. It embodies the Australian ethos of "a fair go for all". Sadly I don't think the system used here in the USA is worthy of its citizens.	Australia does not have mandatory voting either. It is a person's personal choice whether or not to vote and should not be mandated.
4842752	Mandatory voting is the dream of the well financed campaign. Voters who don't care and aren't going to bother learning anything about the issues are going to be the ideal targets for campaign ads designed not to inform, but to simply build a meaningless yet favorable association between the voter and the candidate. Promoting voter turnout is only of benefit to society if those voters are educated voters.	Mandatory voting would be a dream for the most well-financed campaigns. Uniformed, non caring voters will be tarted by campaign ads to build a good association with the candidate.
4842409	Mandatory voting would make matters worse. Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue. It is one that goes to core values of all Americans.	It would make things worse. The people not voting shouldn't because they aren't well informed on the issues. If we force people to vote political commercials would influence elections a lot more.
4842169	I moved to NYC from Minnesota where voter turnout is commonly over 70% in presidential elections. Now I live in the NY 15th represented currently by Rep. Rangel. Following scandal, he was in reelected in the Democratic primary with a completely unimpressive 22,000 votes. Democracy in NYC is a joke. Voting only encourages people such as Rangel. If congressional district lines are drawn to ensure Democratic incumbent continuity, the best response is to ignore the voting process.	Democracy isn't carried out right in NYC. The drawing of district lines negates the necessity of voting.
4839122	I would be in favor of the following. At least one of the two chambers (presumably the Senate) should ONLY have voters who have graduated from college. Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish. Of course Democrats have their own banks of ignorant voters, the sin is shared by the parties.	Voting is not a religious ritual, but government participation. Voters are too uninformed to be voting. Politicians are criticized for pandering to unintelligent voters, so it makes no sense to demand that a larger number of such people be forced to vote.
4839017	Mandatory Voting???? I often hear the phrase "the american people are not stupid"... I have seen no evidence to support the claim. I have, however, substantial evidence people are stupid. They vote sound bites, abortion and gay rights. Example: Gov't should stay out of my medicare. People should be forced to take a test and get a license to vote. They should have to demonstrate a basic understanding of the world in which they live. I personally have had enough of the red neck, narrow minded, and ill educated making monumental decisions.	I haven't seen any evidence that doesn't show American people are stupid. I believe people are not  smart enough to be able to vote outside of popular opinion or media fed information. In order to vote, there should be some sort of testing to determine eligibility. Voting should be limited to educated people.
4838707	"Forcing people to participate who do not want to does nothing to get at the underlying substance of democracy." Amen. In fact, it seems anti-democratic to mandate participation. One of the greatest freedoms is the freedom to be left alone.	Voting shouldn't be mandatory because enforced voting does uphold the ideals of democracy. Mandatory voting in not democratic. People have the freedom to be left alone.
4837239	Sad but true, some people think that abstaining from casting their ballots is a meaningful sign of disatisfaction with the political class, or with both or one of the parties, or with the set of candidates that have been selected to run for office. What is true of abstention is that it means giving up the one right we all have, that if it's exercised by all or a substantial percentage of our qualified voters will make all the difference in attaining comitments to goals that are more compatible with the wishes as well as the needs of the majority. Therefore, I think that compulsory voting legislation is worth a national debate.	People not voting is as if they were giving up their own rights and giving more power to those that do vote.
4847228	As an expat living in Australia I am fortunate enough to have dual citizenship. I have often wrestled with the idea of mandatory voting. I finally came to the realisation that it was the right thing. Some believe mandatory voting is an infringement on their rights. But voting is more than a right. It is a civic duty, like paying taxes. Voting is the least we can do to take part in the democratic process. Along with mandatory voting we should also insure that anyone can run for office without having to sell their soul to big money to finance a campaign. We don't need the same people who influence us in our choices of soap brands to be influencing our votes.	Voting should always be required since it is a duty. Voting allows one to be a part of the democracy.
4845332	What is great about Australia is that None of the Above is one of the choices. So while it is compulsory for everyone to vote, unless face a penalty of over AUS$100, you do not have to vote for any of the candidates. It completely works in Australia. Having just moved from the United States to Sydney, its interesting to see when 95% of the population vote and get what they need out of their government..	It works for Australia. Australia's population gets what they need out of their government with 95% voter participation.
4843999	"Places with mandatory voting also have less wealth inequality, lower levels of political corruption and higher levels of satisfaction with the way democracy is working than voluntary systems." I travel often to a Latin American country with mandatory voting, but with higher wealth inequality and higher perceived political corruption than the US (based on my experience and a quick check of some indices on Wikipedia)...so mandatory voting is not some sort of magic bullet to address these issues.	Mandatory voting is connected with less wealth inequality, corruption and dissatisfaction with democracy. I see higher inequality and more corruption in a country with mandatory voting.
4839038	A good argument in favor of requiring the electorate to take the time to participate in democracy. It has moved me closer to accepting mandatory voting than I have previously been. Question: what's the penalty for deliberately refusing to vote?	The electorate should be required to take the time to participate in democracy.
4840901	Mr. Dawson is right, obstacles to voting should not restrict any groups. But that isn't the point. Ms. Hill thinks voting should be required but if political decisions should be made based on a majority of anyone old enough,it would be a lot better to simply have a poll decide things. Mr. Brennans position makes more sense. People who have at least some knowledge of the candidates and / or the issues at hand are much more likely to cast votes which result in decisions reflect the thinking of the electorate. Voters who don't think, don't know, and don't care, can't help and only further confuse thing.	Voters who are not involved enough to register would create more problems.
2326100	There are two issues: (a) Right now most gamblers tend to go to underground organization with sites hosted offshore. All the law would do is to move it to a regulatory oversight. (b) We can prevent suicidal gambling behavior by capping the amount of money a gambler can gamble away in a month by having a universal ID (so that he can't switch sites or games to gamble more). What we do not want is these vulnerable people to be exploited by criminals where US may not have any regulatory oversight.	People are going to gamble anyway so we should regulate it. Gambling can be regulated through the use of a universal ID. We want the US to regulate so people will not be exploited.
2324253	Some people become addicted to alcohol, but after the fiasco of Prohibition, the United States learned that we were better off legalizing and controlling access to it. Gambling has been legalized in most states, and regardless of the current attempts to block it, Americans today already have access to Internet based gambling. The regulations that currently restrict the banking system from dealing with Internet gamling sites should be eliminated. Regulations should be established to protect consumers. The resulting legal activity should be taxed to pay for the necessary oversight agencies, and to provide assistance for those who can't simply enjoy gambling as entertainment and sport.	Most American's gamble online, and most states have already legalized it. Regulations that limit Internet gambling should be eliminated.
2323205	It seems to me all this will do is circulate money around to gambling from spending on other leisure pursuits. I'm still charged sales tax when I buy a basketball. Why add gambling to the mix? Also, wouldn't the health issues that come with gambling then necessitate the government spending money to counteract these? Do government really come out ahead in all of this from a purely money standpoint? This is like saying, lets allow more free sales of cigarettes, lets say to those under 18, so we can get taxes from it.	Gambling takes money that would otherwise be spent in better ways. The health issues that accompany gambling would necessitate the government to spend money to counteract them.
2323212	After reading this piece, I am even more convinced that legalizing internet gambling would be nothing more than expanding and endorsing stupidity. Regardless of whether gambling is popular, or an easy way to raise government revenue, there is no long term benefit for the hapless individuals and families who throw their money away buying lottery tickets or playing games of chance. Those who are sucked into gambling's false promise of easy money are fools. People who advocate for the expansion of gambling as a cornerstone of freedom are playing a shell game with the constitution.	To expand internet gambling would be creating more stupidity. Internet gambling would lead to more debt for the states because of high levels of addiction and much higher associated costs trying to treat gambling addiction. The lottery and gambling and harmful to individuals and families that waste their money on them. People who want to expand gambling as a part of freedom are misrepresenting the constitution.
9306087	It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.	The practice of tipping allows restaurant owners to not be held accountable for employees and gives consumers a false sense of control. Restaurant owners benefit at the detriment of workers. Tipping is corrupt, you can't tip teachers, journalists, healthcare professionals. Tipping reduces how transparent compensation is and rewards the people who don't pay higher wages by using the generous people who tip.  It also makes it harder to organize unions. Ending tipping would benefit working people. Restaurants would need to motivate workers better, but in the long run the service would be improved.
9305668	Eliminating tips and creating a higher, but still very low wage, would create another sinkhole hold for the American worker. Right now, tips put some of the power in the hands of the service person. Taking away tips would create yet another job where the restaurant would hire as cheaply as possible, and the people hired would be those the most desperate. Tips are the way in which a service job becomes more than that...and it needs to stay that way.	Getting rid of tips would create another problem for the American worker. Power is allocated to the servers through the tip system. Eliminating tips would allow restaurants to hire as cheaply as possible, and the workers would suffer. Tips are how a service job becomes more than a service job.
9303854	Those working in restaurants earning $10.10 per hour - without tips - "would have a secure base wage to feed their families." Really?? Based on even a 50-hour work week, you're talking a bit over $26,000 per year before taxes are taken out, eventually leaving the employee with around $21,000 per year. In what universe does this serve as "a secure base wage" for one person living on his/her own, much less a family of three or four?	Tips are necessary for a decent standard of living.
9310501	A small restaurant near us, affiliated with a state university's hospitality program, did away with tipping early this year. It has worked quite well -- I rather enjoy tipping generously for good service -- that sort of work, after all, is a livelihood for many and should be more widely regarded as a profession. But the no-tipping system does remove considerable uncertainty as to whom and how much to tip, which I think is a source of resentment for some people.	There should be no tipping because customers often feel uncertain about tipping and this can build resentment.
9308366	Having been in Japan and Europe, and New Zealand (where they earn a living wage and we don't have to tip), I LOVE IT! I am so tired of tipping. Give the serves a living wage so they don't have to count on the kindness of strangers. Yes, raise prices to accommodate a real wage--these people deserve it, just like anyone else who has a job. And eliminate the tips!	In other parts of the world, including Japan, Europe, and New Zealand, restaurant employees earn a living wage and aren't dependent on patrons' tips. The author is tired of tipping. The employees should have livable wages. Raise prices to actually provide something like a living wage to servers so they don't have to rely on unreliable tips.
9308278	Most people rarely if ever eat in the "world's best restaurants." Extrapolating how tipping functions from an expensive midtown Manhattan sushi place to the entire country would be funny if it weren't so insulting to the millions of wait and bar staff who work their butts off at local restaurants in small towns where there's no such thing as "career advancement" especially for those with no more than a high school diploma. You present customers as some sort of victims to the exploitative servers bad behaviors and claim tipping resulting from this is not "capitalism." Yeah, you never see a "successful, ethical corporation[s] under the free-enterprise system" selling people things they don't need or using sex to sell...	Tipping is important, especially in small towns where there are few career options.
9307034	Like several other commenters, I chuckled at the notion that in successful and ethical corporations, "employees receive a living wage, as well as increased pay and career advancement when their superiors feel that they've earned it." I would be interested in a list of these successful and ethical corporations. For example, Wal-Mart is certainly successful by any measure, but is it ethical to pay wages so low that many employees qualify for Medicaid or their children qualify for reduced cost or free school lunches? In how many other successful corporations do taxpayers provide heavy subsidies to those who are not provided a living wage or benefits like health insurance? So, until such time as food service employers provide a living wage and reasonable health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can. Consider that my protest against Mr. Shaw's "capitalist" system, where "the man" controls how much servers get paid.	Until food service employers provide a reasonable living wage, and health insurance, I will tip my servers as generously as I can.
9312464	Len Penzo writes, 'Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?' This, to me, is the weakest argument in the weakest entry among the six writers who have commented in this Room for Debate topic. If tips were abolished, it's true that individual servers could just do the bare minimum, or they could give excellent service. That would simply bring waiters in line with many other service occupations that don't depend on tipping - coworkers know who among their coworkers are slackers, and who are great to work with.Abolishing tipping would give managers more leeway to give raises to better workers.	Coworkers would self police servers that performed at the bare minimum if there were no tipping. This would allow for worker to have higher wages.
9311766	Actually Len is both right and wrong. Right in that tipping creates the environment we enjoy when we go out, but wrong in why it does. The people who seek and do well at jobs paid mainly via tips live in that world and it is a world they are competent and appreciated in. To so drastically change that world by eliminating the immediacy of the action and the reward would appeal to a completely different type of person. I know that I could never have been successful in that world. Because I never would have found pleasure in it. But I respect those that do and enjoy both the experience of being served well and the pleasure of tipping graciously.	Tipping servers provides an added incentive to create a pleasant environment for the customers. People who work at tipped jobs are competent and appreciated in that world. I am pleased by those who can enjoy good service and tip well for it.
9308555	"Why would any server go out of his way to give excellent service when he knows he'll be getting the same pay regardless of whether he busts his hump or takes it relatively easy by doing just enough to meet the minimum standards?" How about to keep his job? There's no reason that waitstaff couldn't have performance reviews like many other occupations. And without tipping, I betunhappy customers would communicate that fact directly to management, instead of just to the individual server via dollar bills.	Waitstaff should have performance reviews and customers should send their opinions to management rather than by tipping.
9307487	I just returned from 3 wonderful weeks in Japan. Part of what made it wonderful was not that I didn't have to tip (I was told it would have insulted service personnel), but that the service was uniformly, 100% outstanding no matter what city or village I was in, no matter the type of service establishment. The whole experience was a delight.	In many places, you don't tip. Tipping actually insults service personnel. The service can be uniformly outstanding regardless of location.
9327086	I'm on the side of (at least) minimum wage. But I want to raise a different issue. Since when do we owe the bakery clerk a tip? The coffee barista? Every place you go up to a counter, place an order, pick it up yourself, clear your own table--has a tip jar. Should we have tip jars for librarians? Grocery checkers? Shoe sales people? The whole thing is insane. People should work for wages, and employers should pay them. If that means the product costs more, we have a choice about consuming/buying it. PS I had my days as a waitress. So has my daughter. I understand that if you're paid no wages, you depend on tips--and I tip in restaurants. But I don't think it's the right system.	The issue of whether restaurants should do away with tipping is not the issue that interests me. Places in which you pick your order up or clean up after yourself have tip jars, and we do not owe them those tips. Employers should pay fair wages and if that increases cost so be it.
9312264	The current arrangement for American diners is that by choosing to eat in a restaurant we agree to subsidize a portion of the restaurants cost for service. Diners do not get to select or supervise the server but we can compensate servers according to how we value the service we receive. This is not a universal system but how it could ever be significantly changed in the US is not immediately obvious.	It is an arrangement we as Americans have agreed to to tip our waiters to cover part of the restaurant costs. Diners may not be able to select the server, but they can compensate them according to their service.
9309004	Bottom line, anyone arguing against tipping is just trying to rationalizes their cheapness. The deep thinker that said tipping is anticapitalistic obviously did not think this through. What is more entrepeneurial then have to suceed or fail solely on your hard work, charm and guile.	A server deserves a tip for providing you a service. Tipping rewards entrepreneurial spirit and hard work.
9308759	The best service I've ever had in restaurants, taxis, hotels, and bars has been in Japan where offering a tip seems to almost be received as an insult. I think we should adopt the Japanese system and pay servers adequately without tips.	Servers should be paid adequately without tips.
9308158	i travel in many places in the world where tipping is really just that..Not in the US where it should be called 'wages'. And the restaurants are packed. (see Paris etc). When you get the bill you don't have to factor in TAXES, TIPPING etc. Just because something has been done for years doesn't make it a good thing.	From my travel experiences tipping should be considered something extra, not part of base wages. You wouldn't need to add taxes and tip to your check. Tipping should not continue just because tipping is how things have always been done.
9307129	Why should it be our job to help out the owners of the restaurants and bars? I mean isn't that what we are being asked to do? If they were paid a living wage, yes, food and drinks I guess would be more expensive. I think if we all tipped less it would put pressure on the owners to share the wealth.	Customers should't be expected to do the job of the restaurant owners. Restaurants should do away with tipping if the servers are paid a living wage, even though it might raise the price of food and drinks. If we tip less owners will be forced to pay servers more.
9305215	We recently visited a no-tipping restaurant in Athens, Ohio -- Casa Nueva -- and I was surprised how liberating it felt with no need to tip. We just paid the stated price for our meal, period. How simple! And I felt good that the waitstaff (and behind-the-scenes cooks and busboys) were making a good wage. I've waited tables and I know the thrill of big tips, but as a diner I now vastly prefer the flat-rate, no-tip system. End tips, raise my prices and pay the waitstaff a great wage, please!	People want to pay for they are getting. Customers shouldn't have to tip because if all restaurants employees are making a good wage, it is not necessary. I prefer a flat rate system. I want to Increase the price of menu items to pay waitstaff higher wages.
9304507	It is as American as apple pie, if apple pie means groveling. Why not afford workers their dignity? Why can't people who do a difficult job be given a fair wage. Such a system works elsewhere. The wait staff knows that poor service hurts business, therefore putting their job at risk.	Workers deserve a living wage. Not tipping is viable in other places it should work here. We should not tip because servers will still provide good service, so as not to risk their jobs by hurting the business.
9308914	Tips are a not-so-hidden cost of dining out. They are a slap to the customer after the bill has been presented. They are an insult to both the customer and to the server. Frankly I do not like the feeling that I am obliged to supplement the wages paid to the server so that he or she can have a decent living. That cost should be part of the cost of the meal. Wait staff are properly the employees of the restauranteur - and his responsibility.	Tips are a hidden cost and insulting to the diner. Tips are insulting to customers and servers. Tipping should be eliminated so that customers are not paying to support the server. Tip cost should be built into the cost of the meal. Wait staff should be taken care of by the restauranteur.
9308281	If tips motivate servers, then why is service generally better in Europe than in the US? The answer is because in Europe, restaurant staff are treated like professionals and they respond accordingly. They receive decent wages and benefits, are properly trained and take pride in doing a good job. American wait staff tend to be young people, filling time until something better comes along. Their obsequious desire to please doesn't make up for being overworked and improperly trained. Tipping just props up a bad system.	Service is sometimes better in other places. Restaurant staff are treated as professionals in Europe and as such, they act accordingly. Tipping props up a bad system.
9304196	I'm surprised that more attention is not paid to the arbitrariness of tipping: waiters and bartendeers get tips, checkout attendants, bus drivers, office workers, do not. Why is this? I find checkout attendants to be among the most efficient Americans and they make do with a mere thank you.	Tip giving is very arbitrary. Not everyone in the service industries gets tips for the services they provide.
10530890	Ms Oreskes is " professor of the history of science and an affiliated professor of earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University". In other words she is not a scientist but an historian and her background is in geology NOT in physics. Perhaps this helps to explain why her article is so wrongheaded. Fukushima was NOT a major disaster and was NOT due to seismic problems but the Tsunami. So yes, don't situate nuclear plants on the coast but that does not rule out inland West Coast sites. As for nuclear waste presenting an insurmountable problem, that is nonsense. Once the waste has been vitrified there is no real problem with storage. The problem is people like Ms Oreskes panicking at the thought of possible release of radiation. As for use of water, as others have pointed out it is "used" for cooling and then returned to the system.	Nuclear power is an answer for the future, examples such as Fukushima have been sensationalized as major disasters, but they are not a good example as they were caused by an unforeseeable act as well as being small in impact. Nuclear power is answer to climate change but must not be situated on coastal  sites. Nuclear waste is not an insurmountable problem. Post vitrification, there is no real problem with storage. Water is reused in nuclear power systems.
10526193	Outside of nuclear power for the USNavy, we have never handled nuclear power well or safely, and we have certainly not taken appropriate precautions with mining (see Judith Pasternak's Yellow Dirt, about the disgrace of mining that took place on Navajo lands), or in manufacturing, and Kristen Iversen's Full Body Burden, about Rocky Flats, the plant that made plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs ). That the former Rocky Flats is now, after cursory cleanup, rechristened a wildlife refuge, is a bad joke; during the recent Colorado floods, the old settling ponds spilled over, but no press organization has made any more than a terse mention of that. Many of our Superfund sites were nuclear facilities--badly run, often by influence- peddling contractors; careless about safety; top-notch only at classifying and concealing corner-cutting, errors, and injuries. What has changed that anyone thinks we will do better now? Is there anything in the way government works now that would encourage anyone to think that a renewed nuclear building program would fare any better than the long-ago Washington State Public Power Authority, which never opened a single plant?	We have never handled nuclear power well or taken the appropriate precautions. Our history proves we cannot responsibly handle nuclear weapons.
10527961	Baby sitting deadly radioactive waste for 100,000 years makes nuclear power a bad bargain and using an accrual system of accounting renders power companies and the government actuarily bankrupt. Also, the supply of uranium is limited. We are mining lower and lower grade ore. Also, nuclear reactors belch out radioactive gasses, including tritium, on a daily basis. Nothing is said about this because there is no way to capture tritium.	Nuclear power will not help climate change because nuclear waste as a side effect is not a viable trade for less carbon emissions. Those that believe otherwise are not doing honest risk assessment. Because uranium supplies are limited, we are mining continually lower grade ore. Nuclear reactors let out dangerous gases.
10527395	Nuclear energy can be a safe and clean source of power if we replace the current light-water and heavy-water reactor designs with thorium-cycle reactors. But that will only happen with a groundswell of political opposition to the standard designs and awareness of the differences between types of nuclear reactors. The light-water and heavy-water reactor designs have become entrenched in our utility and government institutions since they were chosen in the 1940's and 1950's. That choice was made not on the basis of efficiency or safety, but because these designs could be rapidly built and because they create large quantities of uranium and plutonium waste for use in making nuclear weapons. We hold on to these older designs out of sheer regulatory inertia, and we will continue to do so to our great environmental and proliferative detriment until voters demand that the NRC and its international counterparts create frameworks that encourage the development of commercial thorium-cycle power plants.	Nuclear energy can be safer and cleaner if carried out properly.
10523770	Is anyone who pushes nuclear energy watching Fukushima destroy the Pacific ocean? That nuclear polution is spreading every day and seemingly can not be stopped. It's not as visible as garbage in the streets or black smoke from coal fired plants which may be one reason that it does not make bigger news, out of sight, out of mind.	Fukushima is destroying the Pacific Ocean. The pollution from nuclear power plants is spreading unstopped.
18177065	I was a teaching assistant while in grad school at the University of California nearly 30 years ago and was amazed how many foreign students were in my classes. Some of them had no idea - or desire - how to do the work & whined & confronted me when they got their less than stellar grades. Rich, entitled jerks. Two very wealthy spoiled guys from Saudi Arabia (who hated being taught by a woman) were openly contemptuous of me and one tried to get me fired because I gave him a C. (which was generous of me). I used to wonder why UC was filling so many spaces with these people when it seemed nearly every 18 year old in the state of California was trying to get admitted to UC. I imagine most of them were more deserving than the spoiled foreign students I met. One exception: the students from Iran. I probably taught several dozen of them. Really smart & hardworking. Good attitudes. Thought that was worth saying.	Students did not complete work and complained when they received lower grades. Public universities accepting out of state students for higher tuition is making it difficult for in state students to attend. I have seen in state students have difficulty getting admitted and they are more deserving than spoiled foreign students I have met.
18179798	YES! They always have and always will ... until our government restricts the practice. I was told by a CA University professor they wanted out of state and foreign students because they paid more ... and that was 1978. DJM	They want to take advantage of higher tuitions paid by foreign and out of state students.
18179442	It seems state public universities are starting to lose their purpose, which is to make higher education more accessible for the state's residents, especially those who are not wealthy. I understand Mr. Johnson's points about the university's financial bind, but if state universities will not serve those they are meant to serve, what's the point?	Public universities are not fulfilling their purpose by bringing in more out of state students. What is the point if state universities do not serve whom they are suppose.
18177006	My alma mater, last I checked, has over 50% out of state students. I would never have believed how actively they recruited those students had it not been for a vacation several years ago in New York City. While perusing the Sunday Times over morning coffee, I saw a full page ad encouraging New Yorkers to consider Indiana University for their education. I'm sure other state schools do the same. I know there are funding issues as the state legislatures pull back their money, but it's sad to see out of staters so actively enticed solely because of their checkbooks paying that out of state tuition.	When I checked, my alma mater was less than %50 in state students. Large ads for Indiana University run in New York. Out of state students are pursued and preferred because of the higher tuition they pay.
18176052	Maybe US universities, both public and private, are accepting too many foreign students. At least students from other states are Americans, buy why are so many Chinese students taking places in US universities, which should be building an American workforce?	There are a lot of Chinese students in US universities.
18179593	Ask how many schools are importing foreign students...... Yes, getting international students is nice, promotes American values, brings money into the country, etc. etc., but let's ask a nasty question: if an applicant is coming from abroad and will pay full freight for whatever tuition bill the university hands him, what incentive does any school (state, private, whatever) have to create financially livable conditions for students and provide financial help to American kids to avoid a debt-filled future? We have not had enough of a debate on this question.	Public University accept out of state students so they can get more money. What are the incentives to create financial help for Americans?.
18178692	One of the sad consequences of this admission problem is that students attending out-of State Universities are more likely to find internships out of State and eventually jobs out of State. While this is not life threatening, nor completely negative, it does have a personal impact (somewhat like emigration)	Students who leave the state to go to school end up leaving the state permanently for internship and employment options.
18177142	The UC system was envisioned in the 1960's to admit 13% of California high school students. Today, in practice, approximately 9% are admitted. Some of the reduction in admittance rates results from the fact that a larger number of students from out of state are admitted in order to capture more revenue. Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year. The impact is serious--they attend lesser in-state schools, go to out-of-state public universities, or they attend private schools. The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy. The State of California ends up with a large number of students who are less educated, have higher debt rates, or leave the state permanently.	The UC system admits far fewer CA high school students than it was designed to. Admittance rates are higher for out of state to get more revenue. In-state students are turned away regardless of their grades or scores.
10228010	Gambling is addictive and sends a terrible message to future generations. The social coasts are never calculated . The very root of gambling's appeal is greed. A short term fix that quickly blooms and rapidly fades. Resources would be put to far better use with more educational opportunities.	Casinos profit off of gambling addition. Casinos bring uncalculated social costs. The root of gambling's appeal is greed. [They] are short term fix that quickly fades. Allocating resources to education is more useful than funding casinos.
10226499	i go to Aqueduct Casino often, as well as Yonkers, and i see pensioneers, and to my eye apparently people with little disposable income. the surrounding areas of these facilities don't seem to have prospered, similar to AC's situation. there's 2 casinos in local area and i think that's enough to lure those who want to gamble.	Casinos attract people who lack enough money to support themselves, such as seniors, and encourage them to gamble it away. The areas around the casinos do not benefit.
10225342	The push for casinos demonstrates a lack of imagination and forethought of politicians. Casinos are not the wave of the future, they are regressive in every respect. Surely the state senator has a more creative, forward thinking solution to unemployment? Surely the state senator has more respect for his constituents, and will suggest something that elevates his district, bringing them sustainable development that relies on an educated and sophisticated populace, while protecting the cultural and natural resources of that area of NY. His suggestion that home prices will go up due to the introduction of casinos is absurd, and has not been substantiated in Atlantic City, Eastern Connecticut, or other areas with legalized gambling.	Politicians who advocate for casinos do not have forethought. Casinos are a move backwards, not forwards. Areas in the US that have legal gambling are not experiencing more expensive housing.
10225236	When I was a student at Queens College and plans for the first State Lottery were announced, $360 million yearly was the magic number tossed about that would go towards education; many of us there supported the proposition. Prof. Marilyn Gittel posed a rhetorical question ...will the money be in addition to existing funds, or will those funds be reduced by the Lottery revenue? We know the answer to that one, and we also know that promised yields never seem to show up. This is deja vu all over again.	Promised yield never show.
10224439	Wealth is not money. Wealth is hamburgers, cars, buildings, all the things we need to live. To build casino's that simply transfer money from one person to a establishment is not creating anything. It is simply taking advantage of the frailties of the human condition to rob people. A caution however... everything has consequences, to build more Casinos is to invite more debt in the terms of social payments to the newly poor who have dumped their life savings into these black holes. The misery caused is also a real effect but our government seems to to be oblivious to misery caused. It seems to work to perfect it.	Casino's take advantage of people and create nothing of substance. Everything has consequences. Casinos will cause more debt from people losing their life savings there. There is much misery associated with casinos.
10224008	it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose.	Gambling is more dangerous to families than marijuana. They attract those who cant afford to gable over wealthier people. Casino's pay their employees far too little. Casinos cost society more than the money they generate. If casinos are not a destination resort then they are have a negative impact on locals who cannot afford to be gambling. Casinos now exploit the poor more than focusing on the tourists, and it hurts watching them lose.
10226758	The gambling industry is an entirely predatory exploitation of human weakness and greed. The mathematically challenged are exploited with the false hope of riches while our communities are stripped of vital economic resources. Far better we tax ourselves fairly to promote industry, rebuild our infrastructure and educate our population and provide universal healthcare than to support these entirely regressive enterprises.	Gambling exploits greed and human weakness. People who don't understand the odds are exploited with false hope of riches while communities are stripped of economic resources. Better that we tax ourselves fairly to promote industry, rebuild our infrastructure, educate our population, and provide universal healthcare, than to support these entirely regressive enterprises.
10226903	All the people who decry inequity and blame the 1% for the country's ills ought to focus on eliminating gambling. The participants are generally poorer, less educated, and perhaps unaware of the odds. Why should the state sanction this type of activity? Liberals (and some conservatives) love gambling because it is a new hidden tax. The money rarely has much impact on what it is sold to help. "All the money goes to education" means whatever education gets from the lottery the state reduces in other aid. Suddenly new money to spend on winning votes. If you care about inequity, start with limiting or ending gambling!	Gamblers are often poor, uneducated, and unaware of the odds. Gambling is another way to tax Americans. Casinos are a great gamble.
13764758	Many have already said this, but I wish to add my voice to their complaint: it is extremely misleading to say that "all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants." Furthermore, even if you were to issue the more accurate statement that "immigrants have seen a net gain in employment compared to 2007, while native-born Americans have seen a net loss," you would still be intentionally misleading your readers, and here's why: By omission, you are implying that the gains of immigrants and the losses of native-born Americans are directly intertwined. In some ways, perhaps they are. However, you are ignoring the fact that the economy shed 8.7 MILLION jobs in the "Great Recession," having to do primarily with the recklessness of our financial services industry and almost nothing to do with immigrants. A struggling recovery may have favored immigrants in certain sectors, but that doesn't mean that they, as a group, are to blame for America's labor market woes. We have perfectly good and deserving folks to blame for that right here at home.	It is exaggerating to say that net employment gains have gone to immigrants. It is additionally misleading to assert that immigrants have seen a net gain in employment while native born Americans have seen a net loss. The loss of jobs was due to the recession, not immigrants. Some sectors may have been better to immigrants in a struggling economic recovery, but they aren't to blame for the labor maker woes of this country.
13761282	Does the Center for Immigration Studies actually study or conduct research on anything, immigration or otherwise? I don't think so. So why is this group, which contrary to actual principles of research and study has already drawn its conclusions, invited to give comment on a perfectly legitimate question? I am a liberal but I've known people who can no longer fine regular employment in the construction industry because those jobs now go to immigrants who are paid lower wages and offered no benefits such as workman's comp. Many readers on the right and the left understand the many social benefits of immigration but have a reasonable worry of wages being driven further down in an economy in which the rewards seem to go almost exclusively to the top. Real, thoughtful debate or commentary from credible, nonideologically driven sources would be appreciated by NYTimes readers.	Even though I am liberal I can see the effect on the construction industry with immigrants  taking jobs at a lower wage with no benefit. Immigration has social advantages. Immigrants are making declining wages worse, causing more rewards to go to the wealthiest.
13762118	The reason many Americas feel low-paid immigration takes jobs from our own citizens is the decline of moderate living-wage jobs. Now, citizens who would typically have worked in factories and other unskilled roles have no choice but to move downstream into food service and lawn care. Twenty years ago when we still had a healthy job market, Mexicans were blowing leaves off lawns, skimming pools, and bussing tables for sub-minimum wage pay. No one complained that they were stealing work from citizens.	The threat of immigrants taking jobs from American-born workers is exaggerated because immigrants typically take low-paid jobs. Those immigrants who would have had factory work or other unskilled jobs at home must move down to food service and landscape work. Mexicans used to work for minimum wage when there was a healthy job market.
13770094	Like Mitt Romney, she has no regard for the American lower class and is ignorant of those unlike her. Newflash: lots of Americans do not graduate college, or even high school and could do the manual labor commonly done by immigrants. Watch any kitchen, landscaping, roofing, tree trimming, nonunion construction or day labor crew and see if you can spot anyone who is not an illegal immigrant other than the boss who is enjoying paying them below minimum wage, with no benefits, under the table.	The issue of immigrants working for lower wages and less benefits taking jobs away from American's should be addressed by our government. Many Americans that do not graduate college, or even high school, could do the manual labor commonly done by immigrants. Many labor crews are made up of illegal immigrants.
13761219	Last year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that 44% of recent college graduates were employed in jobs that don't require college degrees. And about 35% of older college graduates work in jobs that don't require college degrees. About 66 percent of two-year college graduates do the same sort of work as high school graduates or high school drop outs. They are in competition not just with illegal immigrants but the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, most of whom enjoy racial or ethnic affirmative action preference in college admissions and federal hiring.	American born workers are in competition for the same jobs as immigrants, also their US born children who receive affirmative action preferences.
13783271	"Rather than looking for scapegoats in an economy that is growing we should concentrate on improving opportunities for all Americans, both immigrants and U.S.-born." If there is a country on Earth that is producing enough middle class jobs these days, I sure don't know what country that is. The idea that we can handle our own needs as well as the needs of over 10 million additional permanent newcomers each decade is simply delusional. And yet our proposed response to the worldwide changing circumstances of a shrinking pool of new jobs was last year's Senate immigration bill, which was going to greatly increase future legal immigration. Among other things it was going to greatly increase the number of temporary work visas even though the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 3/4 of those who came would not go home when their visa expired.	No country today has enough middle class jobs.
13771563	The English language can be very precise when the correct words are being used. After reading this work of David Dyssegaard Kallick I am confused over the repeated use of the word immigrant. Does he mean a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence of which the US government allows over one million per year or is he referring to those who have entered or remained in the US in violation of law? By the very unlawful nature of their entry or stay we can have no precise number of how many are already here. Unemployment in the US amongst its citizens and lawful immigrants, especially those working in the trades or service industries, is high, too high. An influx of uncounted numbers of unskilled foreign workers illegally here cannot help reduce that number.	We have no precise guess of how many immigrants are already here.
13758777	Life was fine when we had 200 million people. We do not need anymore people in the United States. We do not need more congestion, more pollution, or more consumption of resources. We need to achieve a prosperous steady state. I advocate reducing all immigration by at least half.	Everything was fine without the additional immigrants in the US. We don't need more people in the US. Because it would reduce congestion and pollution and make resources more available, we should reduce immigration by at least half.
13273414	Spotify and Pandora pay usage rates that are much lower than the radio, records and legal downloads that they are replacing. Low enough to where many potential new artists won't be able to even earn a living. There must be some alternative other than artists simply being forced to accept the new streaming model that destroys royalties. For example, who set streaming royalty rates? Can artists unionize and negotiate collectively with the streaming services? If we don't sort this out, we will lose a new generation of artists -- which is bad for everyone.	Streaming services do not pay artists as much as radio does. Streaming is not good for musicians because the rates paid are low enough that many potential new artists won't be able to earn a living. This issue is causing a loss of new generation artists.
17292516	Change will not come to the essential text of the Muslim world or culture. Capital punishment for seemingly minor crimes. Disrespect and abuse of women. Harsh punishments and imprisoning of dissenters. Even much more than these few examples. The only thing that can do the job of civilizing those with these kinds of beliefs is a modrate regime change. This will only come through a similar type of revolution that put the current Iranian regime in power.	There are many examples such as harsh punishments and jailing dissenters. Regime change is necessary to reign in those with these beliefs.
17310331	Yes, Iran is a threat. I do not believe, it even trusts itself. Why take so many years before doing what was asked of them? The nuclear question took too long to be answered. Why would Iran want nuclear weapons ? For whom? Defensive, offensive, that was the reason. It's a country with a religious dictatorship. Trouble for the region, and still, trouble for itself......	Iran took many years to do what was asked of them. Iran's nuclear capabilities is a cause for worry. Iran has a religious dictatorship.
17299490	Iran is entirely unaware of the fact that it has no tangible quarrel with Israel. Iran is not interested in helping the Palestinians. Iranians don't like Arabs. Iran's leaders hate Sunnis. Palestinians are both Arabs and Sunnis. Iran used to have a friendly and productive relationship with Israel. It makes nos sense that this friendship has ended. The most intense and dangerous of all hatreds are those that make no sense. If Iran's mullahs understood that it makes no sense for them to oppose Israel's existence, they could turn Iran into a secure and prosperous country at once.	Iran doesn't realize it has no quarrel with Israel. Having no affection for Arabs in general, Iranians are not motivated to aid the Palestinians. The peace in Iran has ended. Iran's intense and dangerous hatred of others is nonsensical. Iran is still a treat because they oppose Israel's existence.
17289338	I say, let's not be swept off our feet by Bibi's skills and AIPAC's propaganda. Iran is just like any other country that does what is in its best interest. They are no more threat to U.S. than Pakistan, a Muslim nuclear power. We know Israel perceives it to be an existential threat to them, but it is not our problem. We have given a plenty dollars and technology to defend themselves. So let's not get all out of shape with paranoia, and do what is in our best interest.	Iran is as much a threat to the US as Pakistan is. Like all other countries they do what is best for them.
17288999	This is an accurate analysis of the Iranian threat. I would only add that Iran is not in the game just for today or for tomorrow but has long- term goals and plans. This is of course the major weakness of the nuclear agreement recently signed with Iran, which guarantees Iran a free nuclear hand in a decade or so.	Iran is not in the game just for today, but has long- term goals and plans. A major weakness of the nuclear agreement signed with Iran, which guarantees Iran a free nuclear hand in a decade or so.
17288839	Eran Lerman and his paranoia could be speaking about the Israel of today. The Israel that has funded and nurtured it own form of extremism, it's paranoia about dissent from within. Israel is well aware that Iran has no appetite for war nor the money to take on the world's 4th largest army. Mr. Lerman ponders about the true leadership in Iran while I ponder about the government funded Lehava, the extremists who desecrates churches, mosques and those Israelis who disagree with the new norm, the Kehanist mindset.	Israel knows Iran doesn't have the money or desire to take on a large army.
17297009	Having lived since 1980, I know that Iran will always be a threat to all peace-loving people. I stand ashamed of Those Who Mean So Well who have bought into the unicorn scenario. Iran means to kill every non-Shia believer to the ocean - both oceans. They want John Limbert dead six times over as well as his family, friends, and dog. Anyone seeing Iran and thinking ''peaceful'' needs to change their drugstore and quit the peyote already.	Iran is a threat to peace-loving people. Iran intends to kill every non-shia believer.
17299307	How dare the NYT and a group of right wing propaganda; the two nations that are the danger to the world are Israel and the U.S. The U.S has built an empire built on fear; in our domestic politics and well as foreign policy, the focus is always on the danger other nations present, but that is just propaganda for the totally ignorant Americans. How many countries have politicians as stupid as Ted Cruz who advocates carpet bombing a population? Only the U.S. and Israel tolerate such barbarians, and then have mass media such as the NYT commissioned articles to denigrate other nations.	Israel and the U.S. are more dangerous to the world than Iran, but right wing propaganda proclaims otherwise.
17293787	In considering the threat posed by Iran, it's important to remember that Iran has not invaded any of its neighbors. We have supported Iraq's invasion of Iran, under Saddam and even assisted Iraq in targeting chemical weapons attacks upon Iranian forces. We also supported the Shah, throughout his tenure, including over-throwing an elected government and installing the Shah. Iran has far more reason to distrust and fear us than the other way around. It also needs to be understood that Iran is presently in Iraq and Syria at the invitation of the official governments of those nations (with the Iraqi leader having basically been chosen by us), while the Syrian government does not want us in Syria and the Iraqi government is ambivalent at best about our presence. Waging combat through surrogates is actually the approach of a weak and cautious nation, not a strong and confident regional power. In terms of Americans and Westerners killed and threatened, Saudi Arabia is a far worse actor than Iran. In terms of the killing in Syria, Saudi Arabia is also a far worse actor than Iran.	Iran hasn't invaded its neighbors. Iran is more afraid of the US than the US should be afraid of them. The way Iran conducts itself shows they are weak.
8692446	Just because a politician never gets charged with a crime doesn't mean that he or she hasn't committed one. We are all aware of the fact that congress does not like to police its own and ethics committee hearings are often a joke. Nevertheless a wealthy politician has the same weaknesses of the flesh as the guy of more modest means he can just afford to hire better attorneys and public relations people.	A lack of criminal conviction isn't equitable to guilt. People have basic human weaknesses like greed regardless of how much money they have.
8692044	Empirically, this assertion is wrong. We live in a time where the individual's rights under the law are ignored with indifference by those who feel empowered by public office or the ability to influence those in public office. There is much corruption in government, these days, because it is so hard for citizens to be fully informed about what their governments are doing and why. Public officials across this country are using their authority and discretion to advance their careers and to serve powerful or very influential entities with indifference for the impacts upon the citizens they represent unless those citizens are equally powerful or very influential and can challenge the public actions which affect them.	Often people who feel empowered or have the ability to influence people in public office are indifferent to individual rights. It is difficult to always know what is going on in the government and the reasoning behind certain decisions. All public officials use their power for career advancement.
8687859	This is pure nonsense. The corruption is easy to see, and to say it's relatively rare is to be willfully blind. The methods of corruption that are perfectly legal and extremely common include but are not limited to: - Super PACs - The straight-up $5000 campaign donation - An offer of a cushy job at a private company when the politician or regulator leaves office - Donor "bundling" - Insider trading on congressional activity (i.e. a committee is secretly considering a bill that affects an industry, and the members of that committee make stock trades in that industry benefiting from that knowledge) There are lots of ways that those that can pay get what they want from public officials that don't involve saying "Here's $500 if you give my company the contract."	The corruption is obvious to say it's rare is pretending. There are methods of corruption available to rich politicians that are perfectly legal. There are many more discreet ways to bribe politicians,.
8685963	Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call "corruption" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a "you wash my back and I'll wash yours" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best. And successful law enforcement is often impossible.	Most corruption is in secret, otherwise it would not succeed. Defining corruption when the rule makers have all the money is difficult.
8692955	The truth is there have been excellent wealthy politicians - Washington, FDR, Kenedy and excellent politicians of modest means Lincoln, Truman and Eisenhpower certainly come to mind. I am not at all sure that the wealthy are any more or less likely to be corrupt. Consider the titans of Wall Street. There's more money there than any politician is ever likely to have andd yet I see no reduced desire for more. Do you?	Rich people are still greedy.
8687758	The ultra-rich have two options: bribe an elected official to enact the policies espoused by that rich person (either directly or through campaign donations), or run for office, get elected, and put their desired policies in place themselves. It isn't that rich candidates are less corrupt - they've merely cut out the middleman.	Rich candidates are not less corrupt.
18882915	Christians have shot up abortion clinics for years. Timothy McVeigh was a Christian, and he killed more Americans on American soil than anyone besides Osama bin Laden. The KKK is explicitly Christian in their theology. Religion is a tool to stir up hate, anger, divisiveness, distrust, and ultimately, violence. Not all religions are used in this way by all people, but we can't pretend that religions aren't used in this way by MANY people...	Religion can cause hate, anger, divisiveness, distrust, and violence.
18866484	It almost incomprehensible (well, maybe it is too sadly comprehensible) to me that after a sickening attack on the LGBT community inspired entirely by Islam, or by interpretations of Islam adopted by many Muslims, that the New York Times decides that the issue that needs to be debated is whether CHRISTIANITY inspires hatred against gays. Certainly there are prejudices among certain Christians against gays, but none have them rise, for instance, to government imposing the death penalty for homosexual acts, as is the case in many Muslim countries. If you wanted to intentionally promote demagogues like Donald Trump, you couldn't to a better job. His type gains strength every time the media so consciously ignores the truth as it has down here, and by ignoring the truth gives credence to his distorted messages. Nice job.	There are prejudices but they are not harmful.
18864314	I wish people wouldn't paint Christians with a broad brush. There are all kinds of Christians. A decent portion are fully accepting of the LGBT community. To paint with such a broad brush makes you as bigoted as the people you are condemning.	A decent portion of Christians are fully accepting of the LGBT community.
18864084	Is this discussion for real? I guess for some self flagellation is fun and will be taken advantage of any time they can. But this time it is a stretch to rationalize it as appropriate in discussing the events that occurred in Orlando. The United States is primarily christian based civilization where gay marriage is accepted as legal and any number of laws have been enacted that protect gays. Laws written by the democratically elected members of the society. That is legislators who in the majority are elected by mostly Christians. In this free society a non-christian, an avowed Islamist takes his non-Christian, muslim beliefs to the extreme and it is the christians that are to blame? No doubt it can be pointed out that there are other countries that are even more liberal but most if not all of those countries also have a Christian basis. I must admit I have not been to a church in 30 years but the logic of this discussion is absurd on its face. If there is a religion of any relevance in this discussion, it is Islam. If there is a religion in need of fundamental reform it is Islam.	Christianity has helped make legislation that protects gays.
18865303	It is LGBT people who must embrace Christianity. Christianity makes it possible for gays to feel safe out of the shadows. Gays in Muslim, Hindu, or atheist nations do not far very well at all. Look at the millions killed by the atheist nations of the 20th c. for some perspective.	It's the people of the LGBT community. Christianity provides a safe environment for gays. They are treated just as badly in other religions. Millions of gays have been killed by atheist nations religion had nothing to do with it.
18884220	Nobody is seriously attempting to take away Christians first amendment rights. That is a red herring. However there is a climate of intolerance in the country toward LBGTQ people and to deny that it is strongly correlated with religious belief and culture (primarily Christian) as it exists today defies common sense. Homosexuality (and heterosexuality) is core to one's identity and if millions of Christians like you believe it is immoral than of course that will contribute to a hateful climate, discriminatory practices and among the more unhinged adherents even the occasional atrocity.	Common sense dictates that religions, primarily Christianity, have created a large part of the negative climate that surrounds LGBTQ members. Christians feel homosexuality is immoral.
18871115	Sorry to argue based on logic, but this is a question about equality before the law. When any group, religious or not, argues that another group does not deserve equality before the law, they are ipso facto arguing against the full valuation of that group as citizens and humans. So, yes, Christian lobbying groups are responsible, whether they like to admit it or not, of devaluing another group's full civic and human rights. The end.	When religious people say gay people don't deserve equality they aren't valuing gay people as humans or citizens. In furthering their own interests, Christian lobbying groups have devalued the full civic and human rights of other groups.
18866769	"From beginning to end, I believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and I accept it in whole, not in part. As such, I believe the Bible is clear that homosexuality is a sin." Is it clear? The ancient Israelites inherited a law that homosexual acts (particularly outside of a straight marriage) were sinful, but the rest of the Bible is silent on gay and lesbian people in committed relationships, or possibly it even hints at approval in the story of David and Jonathan. Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value. If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity. But because they don't, and because the whole Bible is not clear on the subject, this boils down to a belief held by a group of people. We typically don't tolerate bigoted beliefs, sincere though they may be.	Conservatives should be pro-gay, as they are against government overreach. Even ultra-conservative Christians don't take Biblical rules literally. The Bible is not clear on the subject, and it boils down to a belief held by a group of people.
18866718	"I believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and I accept it in whole, not in part. As such, I believe the Bible is clear that homosexuality is a sin" Your god is an ancient supernatural entity that exists in imagination only. The bible was written by human beings documenting ancient superstitions. As long as you cling to your superstitions rational dialogue is not possible.	Christianity is a superstition and doesn't allow for thoughtful discussions.
18864393	The Christian church of my childhood was hostile to gays, and when I became an adult I made a point of visiting many different Christian churches and asking directly if I was welcome as a homosexual. It didn't go very well. At some point, and if you respect yourself, you just get tired of having so much hostility directed at you. Instead, I learned to meditate, found some compassionate teachers, and formally became a Buddhist in 1998. The Buddhists have only ever showed me unconditional love. I feel great happiness from having found this wonderful, accepting community.	My childhood church was hostile to gay people, so as an adult I visited and asked other churches if they were welcome to gays and they were not.
18864173	"But as a Christian, I don't have the luxury or authority to slice and dice (though some try) and adhere to only those passages of the Bible that are culturally acceptable. From beginning to end, I believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and I accept it in whole, not in part. As such, I believe the Bible is clear that homosexuality is a sin." What this man doesn't realize is that he is saying that it's a sin to be born, making it a sin to live a life no matter what, which I find to be preposterous. It is simply an antiquated view that is taught in varying degrees by various religions and only serves to keep people divided by ignorance. It teaches non-acceptance of anyone that doesn't share their particular view and causes them to try to deny others to have the same rights as they do. The bible can't be used to try to justify their actions nor the harm that it has caused others to have to endure.	I find the idea that it is a sin to be born or live a life at all to be preposterous. Anti-gayness is an antiquated view that is taught by various religions and only serves to keep people divided by ignorance. Christianity teaches intolerance of those different. save people have made life difficult for a gay person by spreading emotional take back spirits.
18863796	Astounding, even mind boggling. Written by someone whom we have to assume is sincere, open and honest, it defies credulity to think that someone could honestly believe what is stated here. It's a massive denial of present reality and past statements, overt and covert. Tony Perkins, of Focus on the Family has said the United States is doomed if marriage equality ever becomes the law of the land. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robinson have said the most vile and hateful things about the LGBT Community for decades. Focus on the Family along with many other fundamentalist sects have long hidden their hatred under the mantra, "Hate the sin, love the sinner." They have enlisted every political strategy, collected hundreds of millions of dollars and enlisted the help of the rich and powerful to oppose every single advance in civil rights for the LGBT Community. An Op-Ed like this one that so denies reality does not advance dialogue, it shuts out dialogue. An Op-Ed like this does not shed light on truth, it only perpetuates fantasy. Declared or undeclared, Focus on the Family is a hate group and should be treated as such.	They have denied present reality and past statements, over and covert. Well known leaders of the Christian community have been very outspoke and vile about members of the LGBT community. Fundamentalist sects have always hidden hatred under pretense of "hate the sin, love the sinner", and they have profited from enlisting the rich and powerful to oppose advances in civil rights.
18862694	The problem of what being gay is seems to be fundamentally within Christianity. Its teachings that 'ALL human beings are made in the image and likeness of God' and that 'the nature God gave to gays is specially cursed' are incompatible.	Being gay seems to be fundamentally within Christianity. Christianity's teachings in regards to homosexuality are incompatible with the general teachign that all human beings are made in God's image.
18878490	It's about control. This writer asserts his Christian supremacist prerogative to control gay people. It's as simple as that. He and his fellows can believe what they like, but once they attempt to exercise control over us the problems start. We are not going to to sit quietly while right wing Christians declare themselves our masters. And the old saw about "Liberals are the real haters." Is that the best he can do? What dissent have these authoritarian Christians ever offered that wasn't hateful?	Christian supremacy attempts to control gay people. Have these authoritarian Christians only ever offered hateful dissent?.
18875591	People of all backgrounds have committed horrible acts against others. No exceptions. To place Christianity under a microscope, and focus only on the evil done in its name while ignoring the enormous good that it has done in the world, is a gross injustice. One needs to go back and see what the world was like without Christianity. It was not the utopia you think it was or will be. I'm shocked that educated people would be so uneducated about history, so unbalanced in their approach to this issue, and so willing to be the intolerance they say they hate.	Christians are not the only people who commit horrible acts against others. It's unjust to focus only on the evil done it its name and not the good. Christianity has positively influenced the world.
18874843	Jesus said nothing about homosexuality. Clearly, it was not a matter of any importance to him. I respect writer's view that Christianity entails a cosmic "order" that somehow is "the truth." He is also right that to pin the actions of a mentally ill man on a party or a religious view is deeply unfair. But the trope of reversing the intolerance argument is absurd, and I wish the right would stop using it. It reduces to "you are being intolerant of our intolerance!" You cannot preach freedom, and the freedom to limit the freedom of others in the same breath. The Christian Right wishes to take away the freedom of gays to marry. This is not a private belief on their part, but an actual infringement of others' liberty. The right may counter, that I preach freedom, but wish to deprive people the right to legally own automatic weapons. To this I say, that there is no use for automatic weapons but that for which they were used in Orlando, to take the lives of many people at once. A greater infringement of freedom cannot be imagined.	Jesus never mentions the issue of homosexuality. You can't preach freedom while limiting the freedom of others. Christians do not want gays to marry and that is harmful to gays.
18872849	A major tenant of Christianity is the delusion that followers of Christ are persecuted. It is pure fantasy and in modern times there is far more evidence to support that it is the so called Christians who are doing the actual persecuting. One only has to look towards several states attorney generals who claim to be Christian but have spent millions of tax payer dollars trying to codify discrimination against gays. Church's are still the most segregated aspect of our society and then you have the nice state senators praying for an early death to Obama. Give me a break Dreher.	States Attorneys General spend millions in tax dollard to discriminate against gays. Church's are still the most segregated aspect of our society.
18871663	The day before the massacre/murder happened I was talking with my friend and having our usual debate. We lamented what was in our state of North Carolina and lamented the politicization. As we concluded our conversation I remarked something bad is going to happen. And so it did. I put my blame on the President; he blamed Christians. Hmmmm. Time for spin for all parties.	The President is at fault.
18868046	I go to a Christian church with an openly Gay man on the board of directors. Imagine trying to find a mosque where that exists. Trying to somehow blame this attack on Christianity is giving the attacker and his ideology a pass and therefore courting new attacks by not squarely confronting the issue. To use an example liberals could get behind, it's similar to getting attacked by Al Queda terrorists from Afghanistan and then invading Iraq.	Some church's have gay employees and members. Christians should squarely confront the anti-gay ideology they have created.
18866895	"Room for Debate: Have Christians Created a Harmful Atmosphere for Gays?" Yes!!! The answer is not debatable. The evidence for this is voluminous, ubiquitous and unambiguous. The Orlando gun rampage and the immolation of 38 people in a gay bar in New Orleans are logical outcomes of "Christian" belief systems which have socialized followers to disdain LGBT people. The holocaust was similarly inspired. Congressman Rick Allen recently called for the death of homosexuals: according to Roll Call, "[he] stands by his actions." So is it debatable That Christians have created a harmful atmosphere for Gays? No. It's just a fact.	The Orlando gun shooting where 38 gay people were killed are an example of how Christian hate of LGBT people can be comparable to the holocaust. Christian congressman Rick Allen advocating for death is harmful to gays.
18865463	"But I strongly reject the oft-heard accusations from the Left that opposition to whatever identity-politics goal it pursues can only be based in hate." In the case of religion-based homophobia, you have a point. I expect that in many cases it is based not in personal hate, but rather in the alternative evil of "I was only following orders."	Religion-based homophobia exists. In many cases it's based not in personal hate, but in the alternative evil of "I was only following orders.".
18865471	Christian churches long ago strayed from the gospel message of love and mercy and focused on certain sexual acts. Pope Francis recently called the Catholic church on its obsession with abortion, same-sex marriage and birth control. Such obsessions are narrow and negative and tend to miss Christ's main message: to treat persons as persons, not use them as objects. IMHO this means we should be more concerned about one person using or abusing another than about what two consenting adults do to express their love for each other.	Christians have been focusing on sex as opposed to love and mercy. Even the pope has said that worries about abortion, birth control and same sex marriage, goes against the teachings of Christ to accept other as they are. Christians have created a harmful atmosphere for gays by being too interested in how individuals express themselves intimately instead of being focused on domestic abuse.
18865250	This country was founded on the notion of religious freedom, but very active religious groups have found their way into the political system and are now trying to circumvent the Constitution by pressuring politicians into supporting laws that favor their religious beliefs. The real problem is that we have politicians that care more about being elected then actually supporting our freedoms under the Constitution. We are all free to follow or not any particular religious beliefs as long as those beliefs do not interfere with others right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.	Religious groups are trying to use their political ties to get around constitutional rights. Politicians care more about being re-elected than protecting constitutional rights.
18867044	This discussion is a classic NYT attempt to change the narrative. The shooter was a muslim who swore allegiance to ISIS. Last I checked, no mainstream Christian religion advocates killing gays. The massacre is not the responsibility of Christians, the NRA, or Republicans, but rather a radical Islamic ideology. But neither the NYT or the President can apparently say that.	No mainstream Christian religion advocates killing gay people. Radical Islam not Christianity lead to the night club massacre.
18866557	Christians have every right possible to believe what they want. They do NOT have a right to interfere with the rights of others to believe or live differently no matter how offensive those rights might be to them. This is the U.S.A not Russia, China, Iran, etc.	Christians have no right to impede the rights of others.
18865710	Quoting Dreher: "We also believe that a society that loses that vision of sex and marriage courts disaster, and that the advance of L.G.B.T. rights means a corresponding loss of religious liberty -- hence our activism and our voting." Religious liberty does not mean having the right to impose one's own religious beliefs on others, which is what denying LGBT people civil rights amounts to. For example, allowing same-sex marriage by those who want it presents no danger to those who oppose it and in no way infringes on your right not to engage in same-sex marriage, either individually or as a group. Being LGBT is not a disease, either physical or emotional and it is not contagious; it is a matter of one's biological make-up. Discrimination against LGBT people makes no more sense than discriminating against people who are left-handed.	Denying LGBT rights based on religious beliefs is not acceptable from a civil rights perspective. Christians oppose things that don't imposes on their rights. It is illogical to discriminate against LGBT people, just as it is to discriminate against left-handed people.
18866470	Dreher's bellicose metaphor ("waving a blood-soacked rainbow flag") and militaristic language ("smearing with blood," "escalate the culture war," "violence to the truth," "wars of religion") prove the point that many Christians do indeed seek conflict with the LGBT community, which wants only peace and the freedom to live under laws based on enlightened principles of democracy and not religious dogma. That so many Christians like Dreher feel under attack from such a non-combative segment of the population is what's truly repugnant. They are the lions who attack the lamb.	Dreher's antics prove Christians don't want peace with the LGBT community which wants to live under laws of democracy not religious dogma.
18866239	Christians appropriated the "Old Testament" aka the Jewish Scriptures as a prefiguration of the Greek "New Testament." So anything in the OT that they found handy, like God raining down destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, they tout incessantly. If Jesus said something contrary to that, like love thy neighbor, well, Jesus obviously meant "except those you find reasons in the OT to hate on." The basis of this illegitimate reading of the Jewish Scriptures is the Gospel attributed to John, the latest of the Gospels and the one most evangelicals love above all other books. John's Gospel says Jesus was In the Beginning, so He must have meant to condemn S & G just like his angry Father. For Dreher to say, as another commenter pointed out, that Christians have a right to base national policy and law on their own religious beliefs, is to assert the primacy of their personal beliefs over the beliefs and rights of others. That's the model of theocracy. Ironically, the same people who loudly protest against "Sharia law" would gladly impose "Christian law" on the nation. They must be stopped.	Christians use the Old Testament mixed with the New Testament. Because they rightfully divide the bible, and don't pick and chose as the author of this standpoint. ( I am sorry I can't not say this even if it gets me rejected).  Jesus showed love, yes, but he never condoned the sin.  We love the sinner, but hate the sin!!!. Asserting religious beliefs over that of one's country is the basis for theocracy. Those who are against Sharia law are not as opposed to Christian law.
18866162	Conservative Christians and evangelicals have not historically condemned divorce the way that the Bible does, but they certainly have condemned homosexuality, the way the Bible doesn't. I might respect conservative Christians for their consistency if they refused to do business with divorced people, the way they want to refuse gay patrons. But conservative Christians -- like Wheaton College -- employ divorced people, serve divorced people, and welcome divorced people into communion without blinking. Their constant refrain is that they "hate the sin, but love the sinner." Now I'm not proposing we abolish divorce, but I do wish evangelicals would just NOTICE that sin, if they're so determined to purify our society. But, in fact, they treat divorced people very differently from gay people, and they're not even aware of their hypocrisy. If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry. And then non-Christians might begin to realize that they can't use the Christian faith (or any other faith) to justify intolerance. When church -- the body of believers -- opens to LGBT people, that church will close to haters.	Conservative Christians and evangelicals haven't condemned divorce the way the Bible does, they have condemned homosexuality, the way the Bible doesn't. Evangelicals need to notice divorce if they want to purify our society. Christians have created a harmful atmosphere for gays and have a double standard when treating divorced persons and gay persons. Gay congregants should be accepted. When the church opens to LGBT people, it will close to haters.
18864357	We also believe that a society that loses that vision of sex and marriage courts disaster, and that the advance of L.G.B.T. rights means a corresponding loss of religious liberty -- hence our activism and our voting. Hence the irrationality of your worldview. Your religious liberty is in no way threatned by same sex marriage. I assume your faith and god are exclusive and that the marriage conducted under the shinto faith would not be recognized, but somehow there is no move attempt to forbid civil law in these cases. The opposition is no more then bigotry and intolerance masked as faith, and your erudite sounding words clothe it further.	Religious liberties aren't threatened with same sex marriages. Some Christians can be bigots and intolerant.
18866079	"We also believe that a society that loses that vision of sex and marriage courts disaster, and that the advance of L.G.B.T. rights means a corresponding loss of religious liberty" How a loss of religious liberty? Why not, you believe and do your thing and leave others free to believe and do their thing. What happened to religious teachings of love, compassion, tolerance, non-judgement, self-reflection - why are those teachings the least mentioned or adhered to by organized religion?	Religious liberties point towards losses in terms of sex and marriage. Teachings of love, compassion, tolerance, non-judgement, and self-reflection are not adhered to by organized religion.
18866076	What a complete bunch of nonsense. Most Muslim countries either arrest gays or execute them and instead of highlighting this fact we get a piece from the NYT on perceived discrimination by Christians. I am beginning to think that maybe Obama really is Muslim and the NYT takes its orders from him.	Muslim countries arrest or execute gays.
18864139	"Yet that same Bible gives us Christians a particular anthropology, and reveals to us the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order." And herein lies the problem. If you look to a "holy" book written long, long ago and betraying its human origins on every page for guidance on issues of cosmology, biology, sexuality and other human and natural sciences, you will inevitably be in constant conflict with social progress and, indeed, reality. There is no secular opposition to homosexuality.	If you look to a "holy" book written long, long ago and betraying its human origins on every page. Inevitably be in constant conflict with social progress, and reality. There is no opposition to homosexuality outside of religious reasons.
18865357	It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of "marriage" has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah "marry" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife. Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one "jot or tittle" of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly "the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold "the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order" to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples.	The Bible is not consistent in it's treatment of sex and marriage. Defining marriage as between a man and woman is mean and cruel to those who may be of the same sex and love each other.
18865848	The issue is not about all Christians. It is not about all conservative Christians. It is not about all orthodox Christians. It is about a segment of radical Christian fundamentalists that are vigorous in promoting a worldview that is based on a literal reading of some sentences in the Old Testament and are resistant to accepting cultural change and living in a secular society. I am understanding of their dismay and anger - after all, America has become a society where individualism, commercialism, materialism and transnational capitalism have triumphed over community, charity, spirituality and democratic socialism. They feel that they are under attack, just as men did when women received the vote and as whites did in the 1960s who had to live with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights act, which empowered minorities. Radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Muslim population, just a radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Christian population. Change is inevitable in America, and members of those radical fundamentalist groups are angry and afraid. I understand their emotions, and deplore their actions, be it Orlando or Charleston.	A small group choose to interpret the Old Testament in its literal word that drive a harmful message.
18863570	This country from its' start was founded in freedom of religion, that included freedom from prececution. The 'fundamentalist" type of faiths have crossed the Rubicon from faith to zealots. The latter are subject to prosecution in my opinion if they break the law, in the name of faith. This means seizing and shutting down hate centers. We close mosques that preach love of ISIS, why not these other so called churches spewing hate on a TAX FREE BASIS. Time to take a hard look at what constitutes free speech verses threats and harassment.	Our country was founded on freedom of religion. We should close churches that are spewing hate on a tax free basis, just as we close mosques that preach love of ISIS.
18863283	Waving a blood-soaked rainbow flag to rally anti-Christian scapegoating for political advantage is repulsive and dangerous." "POLITICAL ADVANTAGE"?!?! The Christian right has introduced over 200 anti-LGBT bills across the country in the past six months. And you're complaining about "political advantage"?	It is repulsive to wear a blood soaked rainbow flag for political advantage. A difficult atmosphere for gays has been created by the Christian right and their introduction of 200 bills in the past six months harmful to gays.
18862765	"Have Christians created a harmful atmosphere for gays?" Yes. Given that the rants and rages against Gays always seem to come from Christians or Muslims, and that no one else seems to be as upset by their existence, they have indeed created an atmosphere of hate.	Christians, along with Muslims, are by far the most outspoken against gays.
18862412	The author write, "In the past, many Christians treated gays cruelly." The problem is that quite a few Christians continue to do so in the present. The typical response is a shake of the head, a trie disapproval of their actions, and some meaningless comment to the effect that 'those poeple' don't represent the attitude of the majority. More is required. If an organization... or a religion.. is to claim the moral high ground, it must police its members, kicking them out if necessary. This can be a bit of trick for some Christians, stuck as they are with a holy book that approves of the behaviors they now claim to condemn, combined with the attitude that anyone can be 'saved'... provided that they follow some of the instructions in that book.	Many Christians have been cruel to gays. Christians create problems and people make the excuse they don't represent the majority.
13302258	A succinct and to the point article. Reading some of the other opinions in this Room for Debate series shows just how resistant many are to supporting agriculture in the US. So many see no problem with processed foods with an - dare I use the word? - un-natural shelf life. I have watched over the decades as farmers' children wanted other careers. The farms eventually get sold to a developer and the people who buy into the 4-houses-per-acre plat soon start to complain about living next door to a working farm. The zoning changes that result from the complaints further suppress any hope of continuing a family farm. Americans are so unaware of what it takes to bring food to the store modern day, being more concerned about how much food costs or how convenient it is to prepare than the consequences of how it's grown, slaughtered or preserved.	Americans have no idea how foods are grown or preserved.
13304214	The best way to differentiate between Organic and Natural is by informing them that Organic food is regulated by the FDA - how it is grown and cultivated. Whereas all natural products may or may not be good for you e.g. snake venom - it is all natural product but will kill you!	Organic food is currently regulated by the FDA and this label is used to show how it was grown. Even natural products can be dangerous.
13303812	Absolutely it's needs to be defined and regulated in its use, as currently the word 'natural' when used on food products is totally confusing and meaningless. Clearly they are trying to imply the item is 'healthy' or possibly 'organic', but when you see food 'manufacturers' like Frito-Lay or Campbell's with products labelled 'natural', that alone should set off alarms that all is not what it seems. ;-)	The word "natural" needs to be defined and regulated, because it is currently meaningless. Labeling a product with "natural" is an attempt to portray the food as "healthy", but is often not the case.
13305179	1. This 'Food Babe' (neat commercial!) seems to think that her personal campaigns forced some mega food companies to change their labels. Consumer protest works, but not when it is a solo effort. A bit much self-promotion here. 2. This debate is about one word, "natural." Language is too complex for the debate to be about one word. The issue is can claiming in the name that something is not present. It defies logic to state in a product name that lemon is in the product when in fact there is no lemon at all. That is simply misleading (bold face lying). "Lemon" in common nomenclature is something that comes from the lemon plant, not it's laboratory produced analog. Isn't truth in advertising the issue? 3. My food slogan is "I'm very careful about what I put in my mouth." So that unfortunately means every label must be scrutinized.	It is hard to define the word "Natural.". Language on the labels is too complex. The word natural should be restricted on food labels, when the product is not natural.
13303021	The repeated tactics by many food companies to find new ways to promote products that can be misleading to consumers is often shameful and deep rooted as one of the ways to battle the effects of growing health concerns. As more and more people try to change their eating habits it is critical that labels are clear, easily understood and enforceable. Proper labeling is one of the ways to ensure that consumers have the information needed to make informed and accurate decisions.	Food companies are using many tactics, such as food labeling, to combat the effects of growing health concerns. The word natural on labels confuses those trying to change eating habits, there should be accountability for consumer protection. Things much have accurate labels so consumers can make educated choices.
8891216	I agree with J. There is more to education than merely learning facts and how to be more efficient with today's technology. For me Cursive is more than just keeping up a tradition, it requires thought as to what and how the writer is going to express his thoughts. And in my opinion, the main thing lacking in today's education is teaching students how to think.	Cursive helps students learn how to think because it requires students to think what and how the writer is going to express himself.
8891351	I'm saddened that cursive is not considered important. Both my school-age boys (8th and 10th grade) have horribly illegible printing habits. They sometimes cannot read cursive. I'm more appalled to read here that SPELLING is not required in the Common Core standards! Are you serious? I'd noticed a lack of focus on spelling as my kids have gone through school, but I didn't realize that we nationally did not consider it an important skill. Spell-check isn't a good substitute, people! It is frequently wrong. And my kids seem to believe that if spell-check says something might be wrong, that it IS wrong - causing them to make more errors than they would have. (Besides, if spell-check is the reason spelling isn't crucial anymore, then why didn't we skip teaching spelling once dictionaries were invented?) Between lousy spelling and lousy handwriting, the future is bleak.	Students should learn cursive so they can read it.
8892535	I would add that cursive is easier for students with certain disabilities to use because they are not constantly stopping and starting. The flow of cursive helped my son who suffers from a processing speed deficit that makes it hard for him to listen and write his ideas down in class. Unfortunately, the lack of reinforcement and encouragement in the school lead to his skill lapsing, and he is back to a not very neat and definitely slower printing.	Cursive is easier for some students with disablities. My sons learning difficulties were helped by learning cursive writing. Schools are not reinforcing or encouraging the teaching of cursive.
8889573	I once got a summer job near the House of Seven Gables, in Salem, in the hall of records, deciphering and keying in old deed books, from the 1700's. At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life. Those who have gone through these steps learn better how to summarize, as they take notes, even if eventually on only keyboards. A side benefit is that they can appreciate cursive, and the history it sometimes cradles.	Learning cursive can have great benefits later in life. Cursive has been used throughout history, by learning it not only can students learn about it through time, they can also learn to appreciate its beauty.
8892337	Odd for me to say this since I am (a) so deeply committed to technology and computers and type super fast (>100wpm), and (b) have really bad handwriting -- but I cannot imagine not writing in cursive. Writing in print is impossible. It is so slow as to be like using a early (not even late) generation dial-up modem. And for me at least, writing does stimulate thinking in a way that nothing else does. I took all my college and law school exams in writing, even though we were allowed to type them. For me at least, not being able to write really really fast would greatly lessen my capabilities. Indeed, I've even thought about taking a short-hand class since my writing is just for me, not anyone else.	I have poor handwriting and  mainly use technology but cursive writing still feels important to me. it is not possible to write in print. Writing cursive can stimulate thinking. Being able to write increases one's capabilities.
11892792	Excellent analysis! Colleges will need to hire extra administrators to collect and synthesize the federally-mandated data just to avoid losing funds, and that money for administrator salaries could be better spent on faculty. As Dr. Moore alludes, the results of any ratings is already predictable: Harvard, Stanford, MIT, CalTech, Yale, Chicago, etc. are excellent, but not so for most others. Why not rate the state legislatures, who determine how much support is given to most colleges?	Government grading colleges will cause additional administrative costs which would be better spent on faculty.
11892053	Schools should be required to report data on class size, nature of classes, graduation rates and post-graduation on employment, employment related to field of study, income and the like. Based on that, students should make their own choices. Schools should be sanctioned for misrepresenting the data, but should not be ranked as such.	Schools should have to report certain criteria for a student to base his or her decisions upon.
11891604	"Institutions will feel pressure to lower academic quality, graduate unqualified students, or reduce services to the low-income students who need a quality college education most. " This has been happening for some time already, and [I deeply suspect but offer no empirical evidence] moreso at institutions that have been struggling financially. I don't disagree that some institutions could be hurt by this, or that a college education isn't "worth it", but debt levels are nothing what our generation dealt with, and the "worth" of it all does not serve students whose institutions can't get them jobs, and/or accept/graduate them when they truly are not [yet] qualified. If a study correctly identifies which schools habitually accept and graduate without proper education/preparation of the student, how does this not serve the people paying the bills?	Colleges could be pressured to lower academic quality or reduce services to those who need a quality education most. Government grading colleges would serve taxpayers, who expect high results from colleges.
11891553	No practical government ratings system could accurately measure learning while controlling for complex multiple aspects of rigor in all fields and for the differing preparation and potential of students at each institution and in each program. Among the many unintended consequences would be an increased need for mid-level administrators, decreased academic rigor, and weakening of policies that lead to some student failures -- rigor and policies (like required attendance, participation, and timely work) on which the value of degrees to employers and graduate institutions is based. My specialized private non-profit college has many non-traditional students who come for artistic and technical training and don't plan to complete a degree (often because they already have one in a different field); they leave when they've learned the rare, highly marketable skills they came for and find work, but they depress the graduation rate despite their satisfaction and success. The value and effectiveness of colleges is not so easy to measure, and the unintended consequences of measuring them crudely could be devastating to many excellent, effective, but atypical institutions, or programs within institutions.	Government's cannot accurately measure learning. There would be more need for mid-level administrators and decreased academic rigor, and a weakening of policies such as attendance and participation, that would devalue degrees. Measuring the effectiveness of a college is difficult and could lead to devastating consequences if not done correctly.
11894812	Perhaps the government should start by rating K-12 schools. Identify the myriad failing public schools -- how hard should that be? And then, give these students vouchers to give them a shot at a meaningful K-12 education, Improve K--12 education first, and then worry about the colleges.	Public schools before college should be the main focus of the government. K-12 education should be improved before dealing with the colleges.
11891853	"... the development of a ratings system is a complex and massive - but not impossible - undertaking": Well, this gets two out of three right. "I commend President Obama and his administration for tackling this difficult endeavor": Being nice to them might be a smart career move, but it isn't going to do SUNY any good. "I ... encourage my colleagues across the country to seek out an active role in the process." The administration has already told your colleagues how much it values their input; you echo that message when you write "whether we like it or not."	A rating system is complicated, but not impossible.
11896983	Higher education is not just a steppingstone to a well-paying job; it is conducive to a more meaningful and fulfilling life, with benefits that go far beyond the economic. A ratings system whose metrics all have dollar signs in front of them is pernicious and should be avoided at all cost.	There is far more to higher education than the economic justification that the government uses to grade the colleges. The system is based on money.
11891193	The government has a right to expect some measure of a return on the billions paid to institutions in the form of federal aid. Educators should be expected to be held accountable for some minimum degree of achievement from all the federal dollars they receive. Why throw good money into institutions that have a high dropout rate. We need to force these institutions to have "some skin in the game" as this will force colleges to have a stake in a students outcome.	The government has the right to oversee educational institutions, since they give them federal aid. Educators should be held accountable in exchange for the federal dollars they receive. To avoid giving money to schools with high dropout rates. Governments grading colleges will force colleges to be concerned with student outcome.
11900472	We need objective information about different Universities/Colleges but I think the type of information the Obama Admin wants wont be that useful. Most reputable charities provide information on the percentage of their funds are spent on administration and what percentage is spent on charitable activities. I think the most useful rating system that could be enacted is one that provides information on what percentage of tuition is spent on administrative salaries and non-instructional costs and what is spent on instruction. Instruction would include: libraries, technology in classrooms, faculty salaries, advising etc. Administrative salaries, fancy food courts, fancy health clubs and the endless numbers of Vice Presidents would be excluded from Instructional Costs. I am a faculty member at public university and I have not had a raise in almost 8 years. I can tell you that most of the tuition money is not going to people like me who work with students every single day. If Universities had to state clearly how much money is spent on non-instructinal activities perhaps things would start to change for the better.	The type of information reviewed is not useful enough. A good rating system would compare administrative versus educational salaries.
11900079	The critics of this plan are arguing that a ratings system will hurt the people college is supposed to help most: low income, poorly prepared students. I would argue that the university system as it exists already hurts these people. My husband teaches at the University of New Orleans, where much of the student population comes from the underserved and woefully inadequate Louisiana state public education system. Although he works in a production department, he teaches history and theory, requiring his students to research and write thousands of words a semester. Even though they are juniors and seniors, most of his students don't know how to do this, so he conducts writing and research seminars for every class, every semester. Students fear his class before they take it, yet he has the highest approval rating in his department, which is one of the highest rated at the university. Despite his exemplary record teaching poorly prepared students, he was denied tenure because his publication record wasn't strong. They told him that for his position, publication was THE top priority. A university that claims to value its students actually had the gall to put this in writing.	Critics believe that ratings will hurt certain students at a college. The system as it is underserves minorities.
11899614	In theory, this sounds wonderful. In practice, it will be a waste of money. Many reviews are conducted in many areas by the feds but the politics, ability of staff whom review, understanding of what they are reviewing, implementation, initial results and then white washing the results leaves much to be desired. The federal government does not have the capability for many reasons to rate. Maybe it should start rating its own departments from an independent and non-political (if that is possible) and address its issues first.	Government grading colleges will waste money. The federal reviews are not what is wanted because of the white washing of results, politics, and understanding of what is being reviewed. The government is not capable of rating, for many reasons.
11896947	If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Beware of the man who promises more than anyone can possibly deliver: "Ideally, the rating and performance-based funding system would drive states, institutions and students toward the transformative change needed to tame student loan debt and jump-start social mobility." Yeah, right. As if. We have an increasingly unequal society. Parents and students are afraid they won't learn what they need for success. Educational ranking, in that environment of fear, pushes schools into offering quicker graduation, streamlined curricula, and narrower and more uniform education, in order to prove they can hit their numbers. Student learning cannot easily be measured. So it will be neglected in favor of what can be measured. What this guy is advocating is harmful to students and harmful to education. But it looks like it's the future.	Educational ranking makes schools want to offer quicker graduation, streamlined criteria, and less custom learner just to hit their numbers. Student learning can't be measured.
11894913	A ratings system that leads to accountability seems to be the Obama administration's backdoor attempt to control the for-profits, who are, by and large, giving out junk degrees while raking in the federal loans. The easiest solution is to refuse to lend Federal money to students who attend for-profits; however, the for-profit lobby is too powerful in Congress to make this happen. So Obama is proposing a compromise--rate all of the universities and decide on federal loans from there. Like the health insurance compromise that resulted in Obamacare, setting up a ratings system is a messy solution, but better than doing nothing. The growing student debt problem may very well be our next financial crisis, and if a ratings system can prevent it, so be it.	Colleges are stealing money. A ratings solution, while messy, would be better than nothing. A government rating system could help alleviate the student debt problem.
11893475	Ranking, per se, is unnecessary, and it would force colleges and induce students to focus on a single score rather than education. But more information is needed about the value of the educational experience each college provides. The government would do well to develop indexes of various kinds of student achievement. Perhaps five or ten indexes, uniformly scaled 0 to 10 or 0 100, would each measure an important aspect of a college's student body's performance. It would not be necessary to rank-order colleges, because each of the 5 or 10 scores would use the same standardized scale.	Scoring schools is a superfluous notion which would de-emphasize education and place undue importance on a nebulous scorecard number. Rank-ordering colleges isn't necessary, because each would use the same standardized scale.
11893023	There is no proper way to evaluate colleges and universities. The whole thing is a waste of time and money. A college focused on the bible is very different than one focused on fashion design. What criteria do you use and what can you do to prevent bias by a reviewer? This is really an intrusion by the government into the educational system.	There is no proper method to evaluate colleges. Government grading colleges is an overreach of powers.
11891633	Something needs to be done, whether it is rating all the universities or putting some common standards of quality. The accreditation agencies are simply not doing their job anymore. There are degrees and programs which are as bad, if not worse, as in third world countries. The media is worried about ivy league and large public universities, but the majority of teachers, engineers, accountants, and others are not educated in such schools. There are universities which have all courses with 4-5 credit hours. The students in those schools graduate with 25-30 courses instead of 40. The quality is getting worse every year and something needs to be done.	There needs to be some government oversight of colleges. There are poor programs. The majority of teachers, engineers, accountants, and others are not educated in ivy league and large public universities. Some universities have 4-5 credit-hour courses and students can graduate with fewer than 40 courses. Something needs to be done to improve colleges, might as well be government grading.
11891248	The ones who teach should be very concerned. Every time schools at any level, or education systems anywhere, or the ones who teach get tested or graded or rated somehow, it is always the teachers who get fired. Never the students. Or the parents. Or the system. THE TEACHERS. And no, I have never been a teacher or a school employee - just a student and an observer.	Government ought not grade colleges because when government starts rating education systems, it is the teachers who are ultimately punished and let go.
10396017	I'm all for broad education. I'm a product of it. As a teacher and professor I spent my professional life in it,. And in my college planning practice, I've guided most of my students towards it. But Mr. Hamed is exactly right when he says, "If our goal is to lift students from poverty to high-paying programming jobs, this school's curriculum is admirable." It may or may not produce the next Steve Jobs - we can argue about how geniuses arise some other time - but good vocational education lifts students who otherwise might flounder and founder into jobs that provide them with pride, stability and a good living. I wish more schools did as much.	Offering 6 years of high school can aid in a better and more well rounded curriculum that will help lift students into well paying jobs. More education leads to more successful people. It can provide more vocational training which will better prepare students to handle their future jobs better.
10397268	It might be worth taking a look at the CEGEP system in the province of Quebec. In Quebec, High school ends at grade 11. From there, students enter CEGEP which is either two years for students planning on going to university or three years for those in the technical/vocational side. Those who chose the three year program are ready for work right after graduating from CEGEP. The students who are heading to university have had the chance to take courses more focused on their chosen field. Not everyone can or should go to university and the system CEGEP offers an alternative.	Longer high school better prepares students for the workforce. Not everyone can attend college and this system offers an alternative.
17975124	The best part of collet age voters is that they have nothing to steal, but feel that they deserve what the old people have worked to earn. Fortunately, we become more conservative as we get older and have contributed something real to the community, otherwise the our party would have run off the rails long ago.	College voters are great for politicians because they feel entitled.
17977461	Who writes these headlines? Of course students' votes matter in an election. Everyone's vote matters. In this data-driven world we sometimes forget that the numbers are made up of real individuals with individual wills and individual votes. Analyzing voting blocs is no doubt important to campaign strategists, but headlines like "Do College Students' Votes Really Matter in an Election?" are counterproductive and demoralizing.	All votes matter. College students are people too.
17973471	Flash backwards to 1972, Colorado, where the newly enfranchised 18 year olds put into office a whole rash of liberal democrats. I was one of those young voters. I have no doubt that young people today can similarly influence elections. And I sincerely hope they will.	College students in Colorado in 1972 voted a lot of liberal democrats into office. I was a young voter. Young people have a high amount of influence in elections.
17965626	College kids are the one demographic guaranteed to think critically; learning to is their full-time job. They question everything and are therefore the demographic least susceptible to platitudes and pandering. They also have the best chance of knowing something about history besides jingoistic propaganda. The Clinton campaign is clearly worried about them, and crowd-sourcing exercises like this one are searching for a reliable way to manipulating them away from voting for Bernie. I find it amusing that a Clinton partisan thinks college kids are looking for perks paid for by their parents' generstion when they obviously are fed up with being ripped off by the 1%.	College student votes make a difference in the outcomes of elections. College students constant questioning of everything lead them to not be swayed by lies and promises. College students have the best chance of knowing history. College students' votes do matter because the example of Bernie Sanders being a clear threat to Clinton with his appeal to younger voters proves this.
17966814	It's fine for students to discuss these different political dynamics, the world has all sorts of opinions and to constrain political thought is narrow. Our country is really overly closed with only two big political parties. As far as voting, surely the Massachusetts Democrat Primary is a great example of how young people, students influenced the primary. The Boston area, Amherst, MA and other heavily populated college towns turned out strongly for Bernie Sanders. That was an extremely close race against a very established, heavily favored Hillary Clinton.	Young people influenced the Massachusetts Democrat Primary, for example. Large northeastern college towns provided close races between Sanders and Clinton due to their college population.
17975522	Oh, of course you're thinking of the college students of the elite. Where do most college students live? In dorms? Look it up. They live with their parents or they scrabble to make ends meet in shared apartments. They work. And they are angry and tired in their twenties. And in debt. They are not your unreliables. Just watch them.	College students experience the same things as everyone else and are not unreliable.
17972248	I can't speak to the ways the student vote affects national politics, but it can have a ruinous effect on the local community. The politically liberal university city I live near is dominated -- and made barely functional -- by both the votes of both current college students and the never-grow-up graduates who stick around after leaving school. Too many of the students vote for what they think sounds cool. They don't think about or care about the consequences. It's easy to vote for a new tax or bond when you aren't the ones paying for it. It's just so cool to vote for a city or county politician who advocates for free everything -- more subsidized housing and shelters for the homeless and drug treatment centers and...on and on -- when every summer you return to your mom and dad's comfortable home in a leafy suburb far, far away. Voting should be tied to one's legal address, period. And for dependent children, that legal address should be where mom and/or dad, or legal guardians, live.	Student votes can affect local community. College student votes impact the election because they vote for who they think is cool, not by political values.
15554749	Except for the PC nonsense about diversity, this makes a great deal of sense. No essays, though that point to one of the main benefits of technology -- increases in productivity that increase per capita economic output and are doing far more to drive the reduction of poverty that is occurring in the world as a whole than the small scale feel good efforts you and others have mentioned.	Increases in productivity in technology led to the reduction of poverty.
15561445	the truly innovative spirit of SValley has not been completely extinguished but it is swamped by the younger generation of ad men and their overvalued aps. The idealists cannot even get a job among this self congratulatory lottery winners. And as true innovation declines so to will the real economic edge. Its as ossified as the google whiteboard which no one can erase cos it has the brainstormed first algorithm.	Technological innovation is creating a lot of revenue for a select group of programmers. There is only so much money to be made in technology.
15559862	Innovation, a concrete concept, was once linked to Progress, an abstract concept. This is no longer the case. We live in a world in which the main goal of innovators is to disrupt our lives by forcing us to by new stuff. As Edward Abbey said, "Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of a cancer cell."	Consumers are forced to believe they must buy the newest and most expensive product on the market constantly.
15559025	Seems like much of what comes out of Silicon Valley these days are schemes that make founders rich quickly by cherry picking easy to serve customers. Uber is a perfect example - they can decline to serve certain customers and let the taxi industry act as their backup. And so on. The focus on green energy 10 years ago, something critical to the future, simply didn't generate big piles of money quickly enough to be a long term play.	Most innovation are get rich quick schemes for producers.
7965695	"...Facebook gets a bad rap; it didn't cause the cheating. It just made it more convenient to do (and perhaps easier to catch)." Hmm, call me crazy, but Facebook shares some of the responsibility -- does it not? It's like refusing to assign blame to gun dealers and drug dealers. They increase accessibility to illicit materials, which essentially furthers the end goal of usage. Now, this isn't to suggest that Facebook is entirely at fault, but it does play an active role.	Facebook does not cause cheating. Facebook has its own drive but not ruining romance kick back and laugh.
7968605	I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world. If you have your eyes and ears buried in your smart phone or your ipod, you are not interacting with the what's happening around you; you are interacting with the technology.	You aren't interacting with people on phones, you are interacting with technology.
7968413	Facebook and Google and Match.com, etc -- social medial in general have put a stake in the heart of any semblance of romantic love. What used to be the private connection between 2 individuals has become a public performance where anyone is invited to weigh in. The magic surprise element is gone because we now demand umpteen photos before a date is considered... yet the art of dating, too, seems passe.. Alas!	Private moments are now publicized where anybody can comment. Romance is ruined because of photo availability which has lead to a decline in the art of dating which I regret.
7965794	I went to an art event this Summer, and over the course of the evening, each of the three women I wished to meet was walking down the street in the midst of the crowd, staring down at her Iphone, oblivious...	I've seen women I found attractive, but didn't meet them because each of them were too busy staring at their phones.
12649273	I suppose that it is unnecessary. Perhaps, one should also acknowledge one's luck when the ball barely touches the line. However, anything that prevents, limits, boorish behavior in sports should be supported. After all, in soccer when a player gets hurt, the opposite players stop the play by kicking the ball out of bonds as not to enjoy an advantage. And this is from players that routinely will step on the other's foot or slide with such force that if a direct contact were made, it would break an opponent's leg.	Things that limit bad behavior in sports should be supported.
12648722	Put me in the "old fogey" or "dyed in the wool traditionalist" category with this issue. Ms Fernandez comments about crowd noise betray what I think must be her lack of experience actually playing tennis. I dare anyone to endure playing amid the noise and distraction of a boisterous crowd and say that it didn't affect the quality of their game. The concentration and intensity required to play tournament tennis just can't tolerate it. As for Mr. Dizikes' comments, I couldn't agree more. The game is immensely improved by the absence of the antics of the likes of Nastase, Connors, and McEnroe. All credit to the gentlemen of the game. Fashion? For this tennis player and fan, there is something wonderful about the return of Wimbledon every year...the sense of history, the traditions, the civility, and yes, the white clothing. Roger Federer, the quintessence of elegance in his play, comportment, and in his "whites", incomparable.	A noisy crowd distracts the players. Tennis is better without antics of some stars.
12654947	What's wrong with tennis players that crowd noise would impair their performance? Unless they are wusses! It doesn't bother basketball players taking foul shots. It doesn't bother batters having crowds yelling that they suck. It is part of being an excellent athlete that NOTHING distracts you, particularly the guy in the 82nd row with a white shirt moving around!	Tennis players must be able to play even if there is noise. Basketball players can concentrate when shooting foul shots. True athletes are able to avoid distractions and focus.
12651106	What makes tennis (and billiards, poker, chess, fencing, golf, even boxing) different is that it's one-on-one. Silence during a point is an acknowledgement of the unique kind of focus this form of sport requires. We, as fans, empathize with the player by sharing in his or her concentration.	Tennis like fencing, and boxing and others is a one on one sport. The kind of focus tennis needs involves silence and fans should acknowledge this.
18336426	Not sure why Nadelmann doesn't say it here, but the vast majority of users of any drug do not become regular problem users. Who has problems with drugs? And why? Blanket denunciations and prohibition are failed approaches. People. Use. Drugs. Those who have resources and good social integration are much less likely to have problems with them. Better society as harm reduction, anyone?	Most people who try drugs do not become regular users.
18332369	Exactly, right on target. I do believe this view will become more prevalent as we go along. In particular, MJ's viable substitute for opioid use to treat pain will probably become well known and received as a blessing. The table is turning right now. Let's see how it plays out.	marijuana is a viable option instead of opioids to treat pain and needs more coverage.
18336742	Another issue is the over-prescribing and under-monitoring of opioid drugs. These have been shown to be 'the gateway' for many people to serious addiction. If marijuana were a 'gateway', then tens of millions more Americans would be suffering much more severe consequences.	Opioids and their over-prescription and under-monitoring, not marijuana, are gateway drugs. If marijuana led to other drug use many more people would have serious drug addictions.
18336292	The real gateway drugs are prescribed by doctors. Those are dangerous and we are seeing the fallout from increased heroin addiction and overdose death. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be used too frequently, or used at times when we need to be sober, like during work or before operating a vehicle. And children most definitely should not partake. Alcohol can be just as dangerous as any drug. Even though the majority of citizens do not abuse alcohol, there are some among us who simply cannot drink responsibly. There will be some who cannot use marijuana responsibly either, but I don't think policy should be written for those who abuse a substance. That is not effective policy.	Prescription drugs are the real gateway drugs, as they are dangerous and lead to increased heroin addiction and death by overdose. Marijuana is a lot like alcohol in that even though most people use it responsibly there will always be people who abuse it. Some people just cannot use marijuana responsibly.
18333733	Two of the main reasons people switch to cannabis from pharmaceuticals and other drugs such as alcohol: less side-effects and less withdrawal: "Over 41% state that they use cannabis as a substitute for alcohol, 36.1% use cannabis as a substitute for illicit substances, and 67.8% use cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs. The three main reasons cited for cannabis-related substitution are 'less withdrawal' (67.7%), 'fewer side-effects' (60.4%), and 'better symptom management' suggesting that many patients may have already identified cannabis as an effective and potentially safer adjunct or alternative to their prescription drug regimen." [Lucas et al. Cannabis as a substitute for alcohol and other drugs: A dispensary-based survey of substitution effect in Canadian medical cannabis patients. Addiction Research & Theory. 2013]	Many patients have identified cannabis as an effective and safer alternative to their prescription drugs.
18513498	Pot may historically be correlated with increased illegal drug use. But perhaps the deciding factor isn't the marijuana, but the illegal activity: once you've done one thing illegal, it's easy to do more. By legalizing, it is no longer a gateway to more illegal activity.	Rather than marijuana being a gateway drug, the act of doing something illegal eases future law breaking. If legal it will not be a gateway to illegal activity.
18366652	Sorry, don't buy it. Robert L. DuPont profits off of reforming addicts (and their testing), so of course he wants us to believe this rheoretic. I know dozens of people who smoke marijuana, not one heroin addict in that mix. I guess with this logic we can say milk is a gateway to vodka.	Many people smoke marijuana without ever moving on to other drugs.
18365640	Marijuana is no more a gateway drug than alcohol or milk for that matter. Addiction disorder comes in many forms, but it is the mental disorder that requires our attention and not the vice. Haven't we wasted enough time, money and lives to learn this lesson???	Marijuana is no more a gateway drug, than alcohol or milk for that matter. Addiction is a mental disorder, it is not dependent on the substance. A lot of money and time has already been wasted over this issue.
18361233	The cognitive bias displayed by Mr. DuPont is disappointing in one who should know better. Focusing on the drug and not the context oversimplifies the issue. The drug war to 'actively discourage marijuana as well as other drugs' has caused much more harm than benefit. It has corrupted our police forces and brutalized our neighborhoods. Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward. As long as criminals are the dealers, the gateway to more dangerous drugs will remain more accessible for all age groups.	Attacking people for doing marijuana and other drugs has caused more harm than good. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is dealers access to other criminal enterprises.
18358703	If we're lucky cannabis use will decrease the use of alcohol. Cannabis isn't a gateway, it's a flagstone on a well worn path. Gateway? Sugar and caffeine are the first substances that one comes I contact with with mood altering properties, followed by alcohol. How many cannabis users have never tried alcohol or coffee or sugary caffeinated soda? The detractors of cannabis always seem to have a financial interest in vilifying it.	Cannabis is safer than alcohol and does not lead to addiction. Caffeine and sugar alter the mood, so does alcohol. Marijuana is not a gateway drug because alcohol, coffee, and soda are types of drugs that are legal and may lead to marijuana use.
18347680	I'll bet most heroin users drank milk as children. Does that make it a gateway drug? This type of nonsense has been around for the last 50 years or more. It's never been right and it never will be despite how many times it's repeated by rich, out of touch, old doctors who contributed to the problem in the first place. They are the problem, not cannabis.	Milk isn't a gateway drug even though most people drink it as children. Marijuana was first suggested to be a problem by rich, old doctors.
18341272	MDs are not scientists. Correlation is not causation. I'd rather someone self-medicate with (preferrably legal) Marijuana. Prohibition makes hard drugs seem equivalent and risks making the gateway claims self-fulfilling. Robert Dupont, MD, from wikipedia: He claims that marijuana is "the most dangerous drug",[11] a claim that is at odds with current scientific consensus.[12] He served as a paid consultant for Straight, Incorporated, a "controversial non-profit drug rehabilitation program" for youth that was the subject of numerous allegations of abuse and which was successfully sued for false imprisonment and maltreatment.[13]	Just because drug addicts have used marijuana does not mean marijuana caused drug addicts. Prohibition of marijuana makes it seem equivalent to hard drugs. There is no scientific evidence that marijuana is the most dangerous drug.
18339215	If you'd like to call marijuana a gateway drug, then you'll have to include tobacco and alcohol, too.... also indicators. Why don't lets focus our attention on solving real problems. This country doesn't have a marijuana problem, and just because there's a correlation between people addicted to harder drugs like alcohol and painkillers who also smoke pot doesn't make it pot cause. If we have time and energy and resources, let's work on the drugs we know are dangerous and lets work on general education about addiction. Diverting our attention and energies from epidemic-level heroin use, for example, or from teaching about addiction generally to instead focus on marijuana specifically is worse than pointless, it will cost lives.	If marijuana is a gateway drug, then tobacco and alcohol are, as well. The focus should be on real problems, not marijuana. Just because some people who use alcohol and painkillers also use marijuana does not mean that marijuana use led to the use of harder drugs. Marijuana is not as dangerous or addictive as other drugs that are readily available in our communities. IT costs lives to focus on marijuana and ignore the heroin epidemic.
18336376	Cannabis was used in the middle east during the time of the Hebrew prophets. A Phoenician shipwreck dating from 1400 BC was found in the eastern Mediterranean with a cargo of Olive Oil and cannabis Amphoras. The Phoenicians traded with their close neighbors the Hebrews as it says in the bible - King Hiram Of Tyre traded with King Solomon for Cedars for the temple in Jerusalem. If the Phoenicians had it the Hebrews had it. It is not far fetched to assume that some of the prophets may have used cannabis to gain their insights and to help them 'connect' with God. Following that logic if you are good Christian You should consume cannabis and thus become closer to God.	Marijuana is not a gateway drug since it has been used all the way back in the time of the Hebrew prophets.
18337997	I have smoked Martijuana all of my adult life and never had the desire to try another drug. I have a drink now and then, but do not smoke cigarettes. None of the people I know, not one of them, who smoke joint have any inclination toward using harder drugs. I've never tried pot brownies but perhaps I'd like them better than smoking which cannot be good for my lungs. My sense is people who use hard drugs are predisposed to their use and not pushed along by toking on a pipe of mary jane. I feel strongly that commentaries such as this written by people in positions affecting laws mislead and in turn do much more harm than good.	I have never tried other drugs despite smoking Marijuana all my adult life. No one I know who uses marijuana has any inclination toward harder drugs. Users of hard drugs aren't pushed to it by marijuana use.
18337579	From Wikipedia (perhaps not the most authoritative reference; but still a reflection on Dr. DuPont's credentials): "He claims that marijuana is "the most dangerous drug",[11] a claim that is at odds with current scientific consensus.[12] He served as a paid consultant for Straight, Incorporated, a "controversial non-profit drug rehabilitation program" for youth that was the subject of numerous allegations of abuse and which was successfully sued for false imprisonment and maltreatment Considering his position as "Drug Czar" for Presidents Nixon and Ford, it is not difficult to infer where and when his biases may have originated. I agree with others who have posted and subscribe to the belief drug abuse is the product of an addictive personality which "finds" a medication that produces pleasure and/or relief to overwhelm any concerns of dependence.	Addiction is a result of a personality trait and the symptoms of that trait are drug abuse.
18337565	"People who are addicted to marijuana are three times more likely to be addicted to heroin." Since there is NO such thing as addiction to marijuana, the above is total nonsense. I know people who smoke 5-6 joints a day every single day, and then go without it during 4 week vacation overseas without missing a bit. Neither cigarette smokers, nor heroin addicts can do that. "The legalization of marijuana increases availability of the drug and acceptability of its use. " There is no problem with availability of marijuana without legalization. Anyone who wants it can get it within 2 hours at most, right here in NYC.	Marijuana is not addictive. Many people can smoke marijuana heavily, and quit without a problem.
18336931	The vast majority of heroin users started with prescription drugs which were never meant to be used as maintenance drugs in the first place.. We're still having this dumb debate in 2016.. Statistical gerrymandering... and no one falls for it anymore	Prescriptions drugs are more likely to be a gateway drug.
18336509	The vast majority of heroin users have first used coffee, tobacco and alcohol so I guess these are gateway drugs too. Or maybe sugar is the first gateway drug? Too much nonsense is written about marijuana leading to addiction of the harder and more dangerous drugs like alcohol.	The majority of heroin users have first used coffee, tobacco, and alcohol, so they could be considered gateway drugs as well. The writing about marijuana as a gateway to addiction and harder and more dangerous drugs is nonsense.
18336951	Classic Bayesian inference error. If A then B is not equivalent to if B then A. But it worked for Johnny Cochran in the OJ Simpson trial, who (correctly) argued that the percentage of verified wife beaters who go on to murder their wives is very, very small, but also ignored the fact that the percentage of verified wife beaters whose wives are then murdered and who are guilty approaches 100%.	This is a classic Bayesian inference error - If A, then B does not equal If B, then A.
18335173	Wow, the war on drugs. People were smoking marijuana for ten thousand years before it was outlawed here in the 1930s. Why was it outlawed? Short answer to a complex question: Randolph Hearst owned timber he wanted to sell for newspaper pulp, his main competitor? Hemp, or marijuana, so he funded and campaign for its end as a legal product in the US. We see how the drug war has ended. Your reasoning could be applied to breast milk, most people had some, and some of them became addicts. In my view addiction is simply in a person's chemistry and some are susceptible, most people are not. As you can tell, I disagree entirely with your thesis, although I like alcohol myself. us army 1969-1971/california jd	Marijuana was used for a long time before being outlawed so it is safe. Addiction is chemistry and some are susceptible, but most are not.
18333912	The better question is, though, how many people who have used marijuana DO NOT use other illegal drugs. I think the answer would surprise you. Correlation is not causation - the sooner you learn that, the sooner you can get to the real root of our opiate addition problem.	Many people who use marijuana do not use other drugs.
18333243	People are not stupid. They know the difference between something which is illegal because it is wrong, and something which is illegal because the legislature of a state declared it to be illegal. The more things that are illegal, the more opportunity the police have for arresting people, especially racial minorities and the poor. Dr. DuPont should know that marijuana is not addictive. But, as Upton Sinclair said, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."	Marijuana being illegal gives police more opportunity to arrest people, especially racial minorities and the poor. Marijuana isn't addictive.
18332722	The whole issue of gateway drugs is a complex one. Yes, it is true that many heroin users started with marijuana but most marijuana users don't ever go on to heroin. It's also worth noting that most users of prescription opioids for nonmedical reasons don't end up using heroin although many heroin users used these drugs. And there is no evidence that any patients prescribed opioids for legitimate pain complaints go on to use heroin despite the many news stories suggesting that this is a common occurrence.	Many heroin users started with marijuana. Most users of prescription opioids for non-medical reasons don't end up using heroin, even though many heroin users have used opioids. No evidence suggests that opioid use leads to heroin.
18332086	The increase in heroin use has nothing to do with marijuana. It is irresponsible to even suggest that. The increase in use was caused by the prescription drug oxycodone. If took the dirty drug heroin and made it into a clean pill. The perfect storm for a young population already in love with pills. Oxycodone on the black market was going for 20 to 60 dollars depending on strength. This lead the cash strapped youth to seek out methods such as smoking it to make it go further. Eventually they figure out smoking oxycodone and smoking heroin are identical and heroin is a lot cheaper. From there they may go on to shooting it up assuming they survive the smoking stage. I guess the fact that the MDs and pharmaceutical industry is to blame might be hard for another doctor to accept so just blame marijuana it always worked in the past.	Increase in heroin use does not correlate with marijuana. Oxycodone caused the increase in drug use.
18331903	With all do respect. That is the dumbest argument ive heard... Ok maybe not I tried weed when i was 14. I became a social smoker around the age of 25 How many times have i tried Heroin? Zero Its like saying Donuts are the gateway to Diabetes. How about educate your children, yourself and those around you. Clearly trying to scare people off only increases there curiosity. Its like telling a child not to do something. They want to do it more. Be responsible. Nothing wrong with trying to escape reality for a couple hours. Especially with all the craiznews going on in the world. Be responsible.	When I was 14 I tried marijuana. I smoke Marijuana and have never tried Heroin. Donuts are not gateway to Diabetes.
18332215	If pot was a gateway drug, I would have been dead from an overdose 20 years ago. My friends make fun of what a lightweight drinker I am. My New Year's resolution this year was to drink a glass of red wine daily for health purposes. I failed within a week. Don't get me wrong - I am a product of my generation. I've done cocaine (really didn't like) pharmaceuticals (hate) and LSD (loved and hope I get another chance before I die). But none of those things, including pot, has taken control of my life. Sorry, you're wrong.	I would have done hard drugs and died over 20 years ago. Pot hasn't led me to lose control.
9773818	Censorship might have a chilling effect, but so doesn't a generation of young people smoking weed and looking at porn on the internet. In the grand scheme of things, freedom is a relative concept that younger generations will have to accept. Individual rights ultimately will never trump responsibility for the greater good of us all, no matter how much the techies/hippies would like that.	Internet censorship is less destructive than young people using marijuana or browsing pornography. Freedom is a relative concept that younger generations will have to accept. Responsibility is greater than individual rights when it comes to information on the internet.
9773019	Its up to the parents. Parents should and must censor. The problem is the baby boomers are perpetual adolescents and so havent the will power to stop their teens. I am too young for a boomer and those old groovers drive me mad with their hopelessness.	Parents should be responsible for making sure their kids don't see inappropriate content.
2653803	It's not like people are driving up to a gas station and standing around waiting for the car to charge. They will charge while parked (say when they are at work and won't drive again until the end of the day) or overnight if they have a charging station at their house or on the street outside their house. So I think the impatience argument is wrong because you are comparing it to current refueling methods. Once the infrastructure is there, this shouldn't be an issue. I agree the government should be investing in R&D of new technology, as well as ensure the electric generators of the future are using cleaner technology. Nuclear is costly, but is well suited for electric cars, since the demand would theoretically increase in off peak hours.	They can charge while parked at work and at home. Electric cars are a good technology source making clean technologies.
2657258	I suspect the real world performance of these batteries will be less than advertised. How will the Leaf do on a 95 degree summer afternoon in Houston with the a/c going full tilt and you are stuck in a freeway traffic jam for 90 minutes which frequently happens in all large cities? How will the Leaf do on -35 degree winter morning in Minneapolis and your commute is 25 miles each way and your place of work has only outdoor parking where the battery will remain well below zero and there is no recharging facility? Battery technology for the most part is stuck and until a breakthrough occurs in this area EV cars are a tiny niche.	The batteries in Electric Cars don't last very long?. Until the battery technology can be updated, electric cars cannot be a successful industry.
2655810	While clearly the Volt is not perfect, I recall a lot of these same issues being brought up when the first hybrids were announced. Too expensive, not worth it, only die-hard environmentalists will buy them and lose money, etc. Yet today look at all the hybrids on the road. And the cost has come down. Is the Volt the answer to our car problems? Of course not. But maybe by starting to realize that gasoline isn't the only way to power a car, it'll lead to hydrogen-powered cars or fuel cells or who knows maybe a technology that doesn't even exist yet. More options are always better!	Hybrids are common on the road today. When the cost of the cars lowers. Realizing that gasoline is not the only way to fuel cars will lead to lots of  innovation. Electric cars will provide more options which is good.
2654685	"Most of the benefits of the all-electric vehicle thereby get squeezed out." --- that's a bit of a stretch, surely? The Volt's range-extender is a necessary compromise but would seem to be an excellent one (for the time being): the "generator and associated controls, and a gas tank and fuel lines and exhaust system" are not as large as Professor Smitka makes them out to be.	The Volts range-extender system is an excellent compromise and is not as large as Professor Smitka says.
2653827	Mr. van Doren utterly disregards the ancillary improvements that will come when electric vehicles become a huge market, and automobile improvements begin to come from the realm of electronics and materials. He assumes, in effect, that the automobile industry will carry over its techological stagnation into a new propulsive means. But this is not true. In the first years of hybrids, many hackers have already gotten Priuses to run as plugins, increased their range, etc. I expect that battery technology will improve, incrementally, at a faster rate than any improvements in gasoline engines, and this disregards breakthroughs. The fact that there is significant commercial interest in electric vehicles at a point where they are marginally competitive is a vigorous and optimistic corner of a struggling economy.	Hackers have already improved Priuses. Battery technology will improve. Having such high interest in a foundling industry with the economy struggling is proof of the electric cars viability.
2652166	Even if an ev gets the equivalent of 38 mpg, the electricity is sourced domestically, rather than from overseas, or Canadian tar sands, both of which has huge collateral costs. And, as electric generation migrates to sustainable baseload, ie geothermal, or large-area wind and solar with large scale storage, the CO2 emissions drop. No one will have to pay $33,000 for a Leaf, either, due to the tax incentives, which are a very wise and efficient use of tax dollars.	The electricity for electric cars should be sourced domestically rather than overseas or Canada which have other costs. Electric cars will be successful when electric generation is renewable. Electric cars will succeed because tax incentives lower the cost.
2657567	I am impressed by the many who think they can outthink the electric car mfgrs. In addition to the millions who want to own the latest innovative cars, practical or not, the range of these first cars is within the average trip distance of millions of workers, soccer moms, college kids. And the electrics add to the big car lines, will help bring customers into showrooms where the complete line will tempt buyers. Of course, the big buys have made big mistakes and could make more, but climate change, oil mess, environment awareness is very current. Don't bet too much against the guys spending billions on the electric car.	Electric cars are practical for most people. Adding electric cars to big car lines will bring customers in and tempt buyers.
2657505	There isn't enough Lithium, nickel and other minerals to manufacture the volume of batteries they are talking about. Any day now they'll be a lithium cartel forming in the image of OPEC and we'll be in the same bad situation. Hydrogen is the best solution. Talk about the lack of infrastructure for Hydrogen is just defeatist nonsense designed to maintain the status quo for the good of those who profit from it. Nobody used the lack of public charging stations or the lack of infrastructure for disposing/recycling used batteries as an excuse to stop the Batteries. In a decade we transformed the landscape with cell towers and converted our society to a mobile one and we can do the same with Hydrogen.	We will run out of supplies to make electric cars. Electric cars will not succeed because corporations will manipulate the costs.
2657466	Ms. Maryann Keller has no awareness of social accounting. Her logic is based solely on a dollars and cents, profit and loss mentality. If she would factor in the savings in health costs from pollution eliminated and political advantage from elimination of middle east oil dependence perhaps she might see the light.	Electric cars will succeed because the savings in health costs from pollution elimination and political good from going beyond Middle East oil dependence will make the cars successful.
2657396	No imagination here. All electricity could be locally generated and distributed. Overnight charging will be very simple. Most shoppers and commuters and soccer moms will find the electric sedan more than practical, and it could be fashionably stylish too. All the grumpy nay-sayers are simply parrotting the same old same old from oil companies and auto manufacturers who only want to build freeway cruising muscle cars. We be smarter than them!	Overnight charging will be easy. Most shoppers, commuters and soccer moms will find the electric sedan practical. Can  be fashionably stylish too.
2656824	Cars, electric or not, if they're intended for private ownership will always enable sprawl, and sprawl means every person consumes more resources. Electric cars will never be a better sustainability solution than a return to urban centers and transit-oriented development.	Electric cars will not succeed because what is really needed are urban centers and developments that are transit-centric.
2656054	re post #20......I have never seen such unbelievable drivel in all my life......"The cost of battery replacement will be $15,000".......the cost will be a maximum of $4000 based on the prices of Toyota Prius battery packs........Nissan give an eight year 100,000mile warranty .....the price of batteries are falling every year and will only get cheaper as more are produced.....as for the other issues raised by others who have posted they should be looked at and evaluated on the facts and not on the hysteria of crack fueled crackpots who live in their own universe.	The electric car will succeed because the price of batteries is decreasing.
2655774	The author is a bit behind. China Based, NASDAQ Kandi Technologies (KNDI) already has over 3000 Mini-EV's on US Roads. Over a thousand sold last quarter alone. They are eligible for the 10% tax credit. Before the tax credit, the convertible has an MSRP of 10,000 and the air conditioned hard top is $12,000.	There are already over 3000 of them in the US. Over a thousand electric cars sold last fiscal quarter alone. Electric cars are eligible for a 10% tax credit. Electric cars will succeed because they are already affordable.
2655497	"If they can get the price point below $15k, they'll sell 50 million of them" Not likely with Li ion batteries anytime within the next five years. The battery pack alone is estimated to cost $15K for all electric vehicles. But, look what happened with computing power over the last 30 years. I see all electric vehicles as being niche vehicles in the US for the next decade or so. Long term is more favorable if the cost of the battery pack can be lowered by a factor of 10.	Electric cars will succeed if they can be reasonably priced. Compare to the difference in computing power 30 years ago. Electric vehicles' popularity will wane within the next decade. The future is an opportunity for electric car success if battery costs go down.
2655159	Electric cars have been a long time coming. Now that Solar pannels have become more more popular we will see the increase of electric cars productivity. It's really common sense: solar panels will absorb the energy into batteries which will forever provide electricity to run these cars. It's time!!! the sun power is always there even on cloudy days!!! I only wish I could convert my 2003 Nissan into an electric car. Could that be possible? Solar pannels will forever make us independent.	The technology is inevitable and will continue to improve. The increase in popularity of solar panels will lead to the increased production of electric cars. Solar panels can absorb and transfer energy into a battery which will give the car enough energy to run. The sun's energy is always available.
2654957	To comment #1 above: This is only a short term cost differential (2-5 years) until the manufacturing ramps up. The Toyota Prius was also ridiculed for it's inability to be profitable when it first came out. Now it is the only car that Toyota dealers will not offer any incentive on. There will be leaders who will pay too much for electric cars of this type (remember the 15,000 LCD screens), but in a short period of time the prices will make our addiction to gas go away.	The cost efficiency of electric cars will make gasoline powered vehicles go away.
2654939	I can buy 2 (used) Honda Civics for the price of one electric car. The electric car can travel 100 miles on a charge. The Civic can travel 500 miles on one tank of gasoline, the gasline is readily available, and a fillup takes only about 3 minutes. Driving 5000 miles a year, the payback time for an electric car would exceed the life expectancy of the car itself.	I can buy 2 (used) Honda Civics for the price of one electric car. Electric cars cannot travel as far nor refuel as fast as gasoline-powered cars. The payback time for an electric car could exceed the life expectancy of the car itself.
2654246	I have two serious issues with plug-in cars, local and national. Locally, NH has the highest electric rates in the country (thanks, Seabrook). Nationally, plugging in is a huge waste of energy. To get a gallon of gas worth of electricity out of a wall socket, we need to put at least three gallons into the generator. Every time energy changes state, there is a loss: fuel to heat, heat to steam, steam to mechanical energy, mechanical to electrical, and in the car, electrical to battery, battery to mechanical, mechanical to tires, tires to motion. Add that to transmission losses, and you end up with a lot of waste instead of savings. Plug-in cars will add to the problem, not solve it.	Electric cars will fail because using a plug is an inefficient energy transfer. A gallon of gas worth of electric energy costs as much as three gallons in a generator. Plug in cars produce more waste because of transmission losses.
2653111	Well beyond doubt, the Electric Car technology is an environment friendly technology and a welcome one. But when it comes to business, it is not only the future savings, but also the affordability factor that needs to be kept in mind. As usual, only a select few will go for it initially. Later the masses will follow the suit, as and when the products get more and more affordable.	Electric Car technology is environmentally friendly and welcomed. Electric cars need to be affordable in the near term, as well as the future. Electric cars will succeed as the product becomes more affordable.
2652079	This will be awesome, like the Model T Ford- a car that the people who employed making it can also afford to buy! Hopefully Leaf Factories will be franchised into mid-sized cities across the US. If so, Nissan will be in front of Toyota and Honda within 3 years. If they can get the price point below $15k, they'll sell 50 million of them.	Electric Cars will become the future car and affordable. If electric cars are affordable they will succeed.
2654646	As soon as there is a critical level of EV adoption third parties will spring up to supply a (new!) market for portable EV chargers. I am surprised that Nissan doesn't offer this as an option -- but what the heck, the market will provide. Look at what happened with iPod/iPhone accessories.	Once more people start buying Electric Vehicles a third party will create portable chargers.
2652308	Yes, ICE cars will indeed be around for a long, long time, with ever tightening federally mandated mileage standards. The argument that "Gas is cheap, so why worry?" always amuses me. It was interesting to think about on the last price spike, and will no doubt be lamented on the next one. Having been through several spikes, as I'm sure Mr. De Lorenzo has, I've become tired of being played for a fool. After I get my Leaf, my mantra will be "I drive electric, so why worry?"	Electric cars will continue to exist, with increasingly strict federally mandated mileage standards. Gasoline will continue to fluctuate in cost, meaning future price spikes of a worsening nature are inevitable.
7237604	Gandhi said (more or accurately) "I am willing to die for India's independence, but there is no cause I would kill for." The gross immorality of modern war--war since Napoleon if not earlier--is that contestants are willing to kill for their cause, but not to die for it. The US killed far more people in Iraq than the 4000 or so Americans who fell there--the ratio seems to be tending toward thousands of civilians versus 0 soldiers. The drone makes the perfect war: they die (we don't know who), we live.	Drone attacks are an inhumane contribution to modern warfare. The US lost 4000 Americans, but there were thousands of civilian casualties and no soldiers. Drone attacks are impersonal and indiscriminate of targets.
7227072	"Civilians and even humanitarian workers are afraid to assist victims for fear they may be killed in a second strike." It's worth pointing out that attacking people trying to assist victims in a second strike is a violation of the First Geneva Convention, which the United States has signed. This rule was put in place specifically to prevent the kind of situation where an attack has occurred, medics try to rescue the wounded, and somebody just starts killing medics. That means that anyone ordering those sorts of strikes (which are definitely happening) is a war criminal.	People aren't helping the wounded because they fear they will be injured in a  second drone strike. These should be considered wartime crimes and anyone ordering them should be treated as a war criminal.
7232467	How would we in the US react if drones were hitting us? The technology separates the President, Secretary of State, and us citizens from the dead bodies, both correct and mistaken. The accidents are somehow even worse. I do not accept this mayhem conducted in my name.	How would US citizens react?.
7230457	America's values are captive to its foreign policy, which nearly always turns a blind eye to abusive Israeli treatment of neighboring Palestinians. This nearly unquestioning support for Israel's policies combined with Western dependence on MidEast oil, leads us further and further away from morally based policy decisions. The Obama administration embraces assassination by robots-for-hire. It may be this is the only acceptable way to deal with Islamic fanatics. However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why "they" hate us! I feel we already have lost any good will that might have been generated by aspiring population during the era of the "Arab Spring" by our arrogant treatment of these peoples. Perhaps this is naive, but I have always believed that "you reap what you sow". There is a darker future in the use of drones/robots. The inevitable course of action will be for government to turn robot spies and robot assassins on its own citizens. There will always be a "security" justification for police state behavior, and the terror we are currently turning loose abroad will return to our shores in due time.	The collateral damage caused by drone attacks is causing foreign populations to take offense. Drones are harmful to the future. Government usage of drone's will inevitably lead to using drone's on citizens.
7228812	Has anyone considered the long term strategy of drones? There seems to be no end to the war on terrorism and no end to drone attacks and no end to the killing of innocent people. Eventually the drones will have killed enough innocent people to turn the population against the US. It wont be Al-Quida, it will be vast segments of the populations that will become intolerant of this on going condition. Can you blame them?	Think about the long term strategy of drones. Drones kill innocent people.
7237962	Absolutely they are useful. They are a stand off weapon that puts enemy forces at risk, and they know it. Even if they aren't used the Al Qaeda and other terrorist organization operatives know they are at risk and it makes their operational plans that much more difficult to implement. If nothing else, in Cold War terms, they are an effective deterrent.	Drone strikes are an effective tool to deter terrorist attacks because they are difficult for terrorists to avoid. Drones are a deterrent.
7234455	The question as to whether or not drones are effective is 'mental masturbation"We bombed Dresden in WW2 and atomic bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Of course hundred of thousands of innocent civilian died;but the bombings save American troops lives. If the Arab/Muslim world does not like civilian casualties ;they can clean up their act by joining the 21st century by granting freedom and equal rights and a modern education to their people Yes America England France Russia Japan and Germany were imperialist nations- "past tense" ,and forced a Zionist state in the aftermath of WW2 However the fledgling Zionist state survived the attacks and it is not going to give the land back anymore than Americans will give the land back they stole from the native Indians When Arabs grant equal RIGHTS ESPECIALLY TO WOMEN;I may argue against drones but until then dead neanderthals from drone attack are necessary to save soldiers lives	The U.S. is guilty of other terrible acts of violence. The attacks save American troop's lives. Drones are needed to battle a repressive culture that results in oppressed women and dead soldiers.
7232361	Robot pilots and drivers are here to stay. We need to protect ourselves from these devices - not develop them to be used against us some day... I'm sure we'll see a story soon about a driver-less car or pilot-less plane used to harm innocents in the homeland that created these high-tech marvels.	Drones could be used to attack the US one day, we need to be protecting ourselves.
7228797	Drones are a weapon of the weak willed. Relying on them gives those unfamiliar with successful counter-insurgency tactics and strategies a sense of security when in fact the opposite is happening. If you do not 'drain the swamp' or wipe out the entire support systems that enable the insurgent/terrorist to survive, they multiply like vermin. Therefore we see the spread of the scourge throughout Africa and the Middle East. Also, the mood of these countries, especially Egypt, is increasingly anti-American. Had we wiped out the terrorists with our ground troops in and around Afghanistan (including the uncontrolled areas in Pakistan), with the correct number of troops needed, we would not be facing this problem today of increasing terrorism in Afghanistan and our troops under attack from the very Afghan military and police. Our policy is corrupt, ineffective and weak -- and it is the policy of the present Administration -- dragging our nation ever more into an abyss.	Using drone attacks does not allow for the necessary tactics needed for counter insurgency allowing insurgencies to thrive. The environment in countries like Egypt is more and more Anti-American. Our current policy is corrupt, ineffective, and weak.
7228428	Until 9/11 our country was almost universally regarded as a one that offered justice for all. It is part of our slogan, it was a recruiting point for Americans-to-be. Then fear and revenge and politics showed what a thin veneer our principles were. The drone strikes, with their extra-judicial nature, confirm that, especially the double strikes killing rescuers. I dread the day when the first foreign drone strikes in the US - clearly a legitimate act of war in response to what is not even necessarily a legitimate grievance, requiring only a suspicion of guilt, given the manner in which we use them (after all, if we do it, it must be legal). Such an attack could, by the standards we use, be justly mounted by families of civilians wrongly killed by our drones. I fear the day that the first US drone strike occurs here (if they are so effective at saving soldiers' lives, they will also be effective saving police lives). I look forward to the day when the Americans behind these strikes, including two presidents, are on trial in the Hague.	Drones kill rescuers. Drone attacks could be mounted by families of civilian fatalities.
7228232	May I ask. What the U.S. response will be the day a terrorist utilizes a small drone to deliver a toxin from just south of the border over to a city like El Paso Texas. The terrorist could stand in Mexico a fly a small drone with anthrax or similar agent causing great death. Yes, if I've thought of it, don't think they haven't or won't. When drones go both ways, trouble.	Drone attacks will encourage similar attacks on the US. Drones can cause trouble.
7229971	There seem to be deficits of wisdom and historical awareness with the drone program as well as with other weapons programs. Any new weapon can be ultimately used against its developer: tanks against the British, SAMs against the US. Atomic and nuclear bombs have done the opposite of making the US more secure. What will our security be like when drones are very numerous, when they can be controlled by mobile phones, and when we have made so many enemies?	Drones may prove to be more dangerous to their present users in the future.
4397684	In the early 80's and well into the 1990's, I frequently traveled from Paris to New York and back. French friends often supplied me with a list of specific American items 'they absolutely needed' and friends in the U.S. would do the same - asking for their favorite French things...Now, with the internet and globalization in full swing, this practice has completely stopped. Today, most of us *living almost anywhere* can simply order most anything 'foreign' on the web...and, more than likely, can actually find that very same item in a store close to where we live... The streets of Paris and New York are looking very much the same today (very boring)...and we're definitely inching closer to the dreaded one world concept. Real glad I experienced life (and the street) before globalization!	The same products can be found in almost any part of the world, so they lose their uniqueness.
4391872	David Harvey, of _The Limits to Capital__ fame, discussed this in __The Conditions of Post-Modernity__. He called it "the serial monotony of late capitalism." It had more to do with the proliferation of big box stores and various other icons of hyper consumerism, than with the effect of the internet.	Street style being made available in big box stores and other places the mass consumers shop throughout the world.
4391169	with regards to that first comment about putting grafitti on t-shirts. ugh. graffiti belongs to the streets. it's not supposed to be marketed and profited upon. it's like those jerks who throw in extras on skateboards into cereal commercials. corporations trying to tap into subcultures which they know nothing about.	Graffiti is for the streets not for profit.
4389907	I was in Shanghai in April and I was really struck by how, in a hip, gentrifying district (yes, they're there too!) like Xintiandi, (young) people were totally dressed in the 'hipster uniform' you'd find in, say, Williamsburg or the LES. Must be the influence of photo blogs!	In Shanghai, people dress similarly to young people in Williamsburg, NY, possibly due to photo blogs.
4389032	I do agree that there is a downside to globalization when it comes to fashion. I like seeing people from different parts of the world in different styles. But I've noticed that all the young couchsurfers who visit me (from all over the world) that their clothing all reflects the same trends we see in NYC as well. It's sort of like how many countries are slowly but surely losing their cultural distinctions as well, as people from other countries move in, store chains take up residence, McDonalds, etc. (NYC of course would be the sole exception to this, as that's what NYC is supposed to be all about...one huge melting pot.) But when I go to Paris for e.g., I want to see French people. I want to hear French being spoken. When I go to Rome, I don't want to eat Chinese food. If I go to some small village in Ghana, I don't want to see men walking around in Abercrombie or Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. I want to see people in their traditional clothing. But I guess there's no going back in this respect.	People from different parts of the world are starting to reflect the same clothing trends as in NYC. Countries are beginning to lose their culteral distintions as chain stores pop up. One of the enjoyable things about travel is experiencing different styles and cultures. I like to see people in their traditional clothing.
12004909	Employees should be free to move or sell their talents to the highest bidder. A time restricted none compete that's enforced through compensation by the former employer who wishes to restrict the employee seems like reasonable protection for both sides. The employee can't work for a year or two in their most lucrative field but the employer who wishes to restrict them pays them a portion of their lost wages for the period of enforcement. A free market for goods and services includes labor. A none compete does more than protect intellectual property it suppresses wages and creates a sense that the employee is property of the employer if they wish to stay in the field were they have the most experience and potential value.	Noncompete agreements limit employee opportunities in the labor market. If it is a time restricted noncompete with provisions for compensation for employment restrictions. Businesses should require new employees to sign noncompete deals so that they don't waste their resources on training employees that are not long term. Free markets include labor. Non-compete agreements are unfair to employees and restrict their freedom to work.
12004719	It is ironic that the vaunted "American Business Model" was essentially based on the theft of manufacturing designs and processes invented in Europe during the early years of the Industrial Revolution. We stole that stuff but now that the shoe is on the other foot, the corporate line is "Oh My Goodness, We Need Protection." History laughs at nonsense.	At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution America stole inventions from Europe.
12004552	How ironic in which for decades now companies have been moving their manufacturing to low wage off shore locations to boost their profits yet they feel it necessary to attempt to legally inhibit an employee from moving on to a a better opportunity with another organization? Quite laughable when you think China, in particular, has paid little attention to patent rights and intellectual property, let alone their ongoing attempted hacking of American corporate secrets, yet, these companies remain there. If a company insisted on me signing such a questionable agreement, it is time to look elsewhere. The hypocrisy here is beyond the pale.	Businesses shouldn't be able to stop employees from getting better deal when the businesses themselves try to get what's best for their business.
12002102	It is absolutely venal and unsupportable for companies to think they have the right to suppress employees' future career options. Don't want sales employees to 'poach' clients? Keep the employees happy through good treatment and keep clients happy through relationships that go beyond the single sales person. I'd be willing to bet that every manager now trying to institute non-competes got to their current position by competing effectively up the ladder. Isn't honest competition the American way? Why should labor markets be allowed to dodge what all other markets are required to promote- competition? Just do your corporate job right, that's how you earn corporate success, not by limiting the career paths of employees after they leave you. The only legitimate use of these limitations would be in the area of trade secrets.	It is unsupportable for companies to suppress employees' future career options. Competition is needed in business. Businesses shouldn't be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals because competition is part of the American fabric and labor markets should have to compete. One earns corporate success by doing their job right, not by limiting the careers of former employees. Trade secrets are the only reason to legitimately use these limitations.
12005807	Non-compete clauses are not about protecting proprietary information. That can be done with non-disclosure agreements. What they're really about is inhibiting the free market for labor. Employers use non-compete clauses to discourage employees from leaving. That saves the employer the cost and trouble of training a new worker, and it keeps wages down by restricting the employee's ability to leave if he or she does not get a raise. Non-compete clauses should be banned as a simple matter of fairness, and because competition for labor makes companies better.	Proprietary information in not the reason for non-compete clauses. Businesses can protect themselves with non-disclosure agreements. This simply is a loophole around the free market for labor. Competition improves companies, and non-compete clauses are unfair.
12005115	If they were protecting small business that would be fine but that is not how I have seen them. I currently work for a sub 100 person company and we tried to hire someone who had been let go from a competitor 9 months earlier. The competitors was a large global company based in MA. We received a threatening letter from them about the non-compete. Because they are big and have more in annual profit than we have in annual revenue, we knew we could not challenge them in court and so we had to rescind the offer to the currently unemployed individual. This is how I have seen non-competes used.	Noncompete agreements can be used to sabotage or threaten smaller companies with less resources.
12005395	There's something really annoying about phrases "integral legal mechanisms for small businesses", "protect their intellectual property and confidential information". This is spoken like an attorney who makes money off of "protection." Wen someone only comes from a position of "protect", they rarely advance. Truth be told, most small businesses have little "intellectual property" and little "confidential information", and most employees are no so predatory as to be waiting to "sell secrets." Sounds like a Cold Way spy scenario. On the other hand, this is how some attorneys make their living an they are not going to bite the hand that feeds them. So short-sighted, the damage to employees while protecting the throne.	Both "integral legal mechanisms for small businesses", "protect their intellectual property and confidential information" are irritating. Most small businesses have little confidential information and most employees are not looking to sell secrets. This policy is short sighted and could harm employees.
12002303	Nonsense. I have watched people leave MA in droves for overseas or CA to be free to work when non competes were threatened. Massachusetts loses far more (including its reputation for innovation) when these are invoked. NDAs work while enforcing non competes drives new business elsewhere. Most non competes do not protect "trade secrets" (very widely interpreted) but are both punitive and designed to abuse workers earnings. Often it is the best and the brightest who leave regardless. And let's throw out that "underpaid for equal work women" as a class are doubly damaged.	Business can be lost because of non compete deals. They are not in place to protect traditional business practice but more to enslave workers.
12010736	One thing about these 'noncompete agreements' (a nice term for 'legalised blackmail') is that they actually manage to put this country behind Russia - Czarist Russia, at that. After all, Alexander II did end serfdom back in 1861. With these ridiculous conditions still enforceable, we've yet to do so. Doesn't this make you proud to be an American?	These agreements put this country behind Czarist Russia in regards to our work force.
11653691	First of all, the Palestinians live under occupation because Jordan, the original occupier left the territory to Israel after the 1967 war. What about the 20 years of Jordanian occupation from 1947-1967? Israel took over the care of the refugees of the 1948 War of Independence from Jordan. Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip. For 20 years, the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers held the West Bank and Gaza refugees in camps, in poverty and riled up. It is the mindset of these Arab leaders who do not want to have a Jewish State side by side with Arab Muslims who have caused the misery of the Arab refugees for the past 66 years.	Jordan left the territory to Israel after the 1967 war this is why Palestine people are under occupation. Jorday, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Hamas-Fatah unity can't lead to Mideast peace because the Jordanian and Egyptian occupiers detained West Bank and Gaza refugees for two decades. Arab leaders have no interest in sitting beside a Jewish State that is responsible for decades of Arab refugees.
11652915	And what happens if this wondrous one state is not the earthly democratic paradise that the blogger and some posters promise, that 60 years of bitter strife over land, religion, history etc insures that the Arab side, when in the majority, decides to exact revenge for all past wrongs real and imagined? The Jews would be lucky to get out alive, as witness the murderous strife in Egypt between Muslim factions. I suppose if that happens the blogger will write another article saying "gosh, I really feel bad about this, but it seemed a good idea at the time". As much as I have posted here about the evil of the settlements and the despicable "land before peace" attitude of the Likud, I would say that the Israelis would have to have a death wish, certainly for their state and likely also for themselves, to ever accede to this exercise in sheer Pollyannaish propaganda. Two states is the way to go, and to effect this outcome, the US government has to stop treating Likud with kid gloves.	It is likely that Jewish people would be slaughtered, proof of that is what is happening between Egyptians and Muslims. It would be unwise for the Israelis to accede to this propaganda.
11643854	Israelis would become the minority in a single state, subject to whatever retributions desired by the majority Palestinians. Palestinians would remain second class citizens by virtue of the Israelis having developed both a wealthy economy and having developed and controlled both the modern infrastructure, businesses, and public institutions. The Palestinians would have to be given much of what is in Israeli hands and help them to learn how to manage it and money to support the transition from taxes upon the more well to do (Israelis) to achieve equality in a single state. That's a lot of potential pain and loss for Israelis in a single state.	It cannot happen until Israeli's learn how to better manage their money and put taxation equality into place. A single state would cause much pain and loss for Israelis.
11650685	Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel, the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict. When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.	The leadership in Palestine is too weak to make the choices needed for trading concession with Israel. One voice for the Palestinians is necessary for concessions to be made with Israel.
11650201	Arab League has forbidden Abbas to recognize the Jewish state. Arabs showed clearly that their goal is not a peace, but a destruction of Israel. About what can Israel speak with Arabo-fascists? About a destruction of Israel? Pandering to the Arab aggressors and sacrificing the tiny Israel contradicts the moral values of the West.	Abbas has been forbidden by the Arab League to recognize the Jewish state. Arabs main goal is to destroy Israel. Israel cannot speak with Arabo-fascists. We should not pander to the Arab aggressors.
11644722	The post election standoff was cemented in place by a US/Israeli sponsored coup prepared by Fatah's leader-in-prospect Dahlan. He so bungled that he left himself out of serious contention for leadership of Fatah. That was his power play to replace Abbas as the useful tool of Israel, and he both failed and exposed himself for the Quisling that he is. Still, the Palestinians never recovered from the coup attempt pushed by the US and Israel. The reaction to this unity attempt highlights the continuing use by them of the division of the Palestinians, the gift of the Quisling that keeps on giving.	Unity will not work because Fatah is US/Israeli backed. Palestine has yet to recover from the coup attempt advocated by the US and Israel. The unity attempts shoe that Hamas and Fatah cannot work together.
9833799	Almost exactly 50 years ago today we had the March on Washington. A great moment in non-violence. Did we learn nothing? We should bomb the people who are being gassed? IF there was a way to extract Assad and have him stand trail for war crimes I would be all for it. To pour more violence into the region does not make sense to me. That said I do not know what the answer is.	It would be unnecessary violence. There shouldn't be more violence in the region.
9833957	The warring factions in Syria are, it can be safely assumed, enemies of the United States. It escapes me, therefore, how the intervention of the United States' armed forces on one side or the other is in the best interest of the American people. When will they ever learn? The U.S. could do worse than simply watching and learning from Russia's and China's foreign policy decisions.	The US should not attack Stria because they are all US enemies.
9833541	Mr. Walt presents not an argument against defending the norm prohibiting the use of chemical weapons, but an argument against the norm itself (". . .Using nerve agents like sarin is illegal under international law, but they are not true ' weapons of mass destruction.' Because they are hard to use in most battlefield situations, chemical weapons are usually less lethal than non-taboo weapons like high explosive. ..."). That may be an argument worth having (I'd vehemently disagree) but it's clearly not a position shared by this government. And a norm that can be violated without consequence is no norm at all. More, beyond mere moral issues implicated in chemical weapons bans, the US - as the most powerful conventional military on the planet - has a powerful interest in upholding norms against the use of non-conventional weapons.	The US should be interested in using their powers to keep non-conventional weapons use to a minimum.
9832134	I agree with some of this writer's assessment but where is the moral imperative here? Do we see people on TV including small children who have been gasses and ignore that? Have we forgot the lessons of the Holacaust of WW 2? I would hope not at this stage in world history. That is why this must not be a US decision but a world decision done in concert with thhe countries of the Middle East and not another unwanted invasion by a foreign power.	People have forgotten the lessons from the WW2 Holocaust.
9830936	We cannot sit idly by and accept the Syrian government' actions, if there is clear evidence of the alleged atrocities. Sure, we were misled into Iraq and the non-existent WMD. We have to forget THAT mind-set. How clear and solid is the evidence of chemical weapons used against the Syrian people by the Assad regime? I don't buy the Russian claims. But we have to be very certain before we take any unilateral steps this time in that region. IF the allegations are true, no civilized country can watch it without doing something. We should also ask our 'friends' in the region.	The US can't just sit by as the Syrian government acts. No civilized country should watch without doing something, if allegations are true.
9844415	The west is already engaged in the conflict. Has been since its inception, because it was one of the causes of it. Ignorance of NYT readers is astounding; why don't you read other media for a change, and get out of the information bubble that is shaped by the state department. This foreign policy has been around for the last 2 decades and getting rid of Assad is one of critical components. Crushing of Syria will cut the supply chain to Hezbollah and secure peace for israel. There are other interests as well. Saudis would like to pipe gas to Europe and undermine the monopoly of Russian Gazprom. Europeans would like that too. Foreign policy had an article recently that when Saddam was gassing Iranians in the 80's, he was getting logistical support from USA.	The west is already involved. Without Syria providing supplies to Hezbollah Israel would be at peace. USA support for Saddam gassing Iranians in the 80"s set a precedent which now supports US attack on Syria.
9836727	The biggest mistake Obama made was his red line comment. Now US credibility is on the line and Iran is watching us. No good will come out of bombing Syria, but much worse may come out for not bombing Syria. Intervening in Syria must have a real purpose. The Administration hasn't given a purpose other than punishing Assad for using chemical weapons. That will not stop Assad. In fact it may even embolden him to use it indiscriminately. Then what? Topple Assad? Who will control Syria afterwards? Obama should have read Lincoln - Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.	The credibility of the US is at stake as Iran watches us. While bombing Syria isn't a great idea, worse things may come if the US doesn't bomb them. There has to be a reason to attack Syria.
9832599	Any intervention is a slippery slope to full involvement which is why we should stay as far away from Syria as possible no matter what they do. Lookt at Libya -- we started out with R2P just to save those Jihadist in Benghazi from Qaddafi. Well it quickly morpher into regime change in violation of the UN SC resolution. So we acted outside the law. We didn't care we are the US - we are not bound by any LAW not even one passed in Congress. And regime change in Libya led to the muder of a US Ambassador -- does anyone think that what is about to happen will end any differently. The President will lie to us as we were lied to about NSA and lied to about US intentions in Libya. In another month we will be bleeding and dying in Syria to remove Assad and install Al Nusra in power -- the so called FSA will either defect to Al Nusra or be buthchered by them. This is a disaster in the making for the US.	In order to avoid becoming fully involved in their war, we should stay completely out of everything going on in Syria. Regime change in Libya led to the murder of a US Ambassador, and attacking Syria could have similar results. It would be a disaster.
9831390	Not our fight. What is the objective? How would we know when we have achieved that objective? Who really wins? Al-Qa'eda again, would be my guess. The British, the French, and Turkey all have the ability to project military power in the Eastern Mediterranean. Let them go after Syria, and let them bear the consequences. To be fair, I only worked in U.S. embassies in the Middle East for 10 years, and have only studied the Arabic language, culture, and politics for 27 years, so I might not know what I'm talking about.	Not our fight. The US attacking Syria would only create more problems no matter which faction wins, probably Al-Qa'eda. The British, French, and Turkish should project military power on Syria, and bear the consequences.
9830551	One Iraq debacle in our nation's history, added to our failure in Vietnam, should convince any sane American there is no gain to our waging war in Syria. If we can't sort out the criminally insane from the violently stupid, it's not our battle.	Syria has not tried U.S so there is no war but if so we are ready. The US should stay out of Syria because we don't know who the good guys are.
9830218	To deter the future use of chemical weapons should be the stated and sole goal of any military strike; it is consistent with the "red line" statement of a year ago. No other goal should be put forth. The military strike should be significant, short of duration, and then concluded. Concluded. Concluded. Talk about a future Syria "that is peaceful, non-sectarian, democratic, legitimate, tolerant..." should be absolutely avoided. We're talking about the Middle East here, not Scandinavia.	The US should deter the future use of chemical weapons.
9841537	This is a terrible idea. Attacking Syria will only make things worse. Obama knows that. Chuch Hagel really knows that, Kerry should know that. Yet our supposedly wise leaders are counseling the use of force. Remember WMDs in Irag? We don't know for sure whether chemical weapons have been used and if they were we don't know who used them. Not to mention the apparently minor point that attacking a country except in self-defense is illegal under international law.	It's a bad idea. An attack on Syria would worsen things. It's unsure whether chemical weapons have been used, and if so, who used them. It is illegal to attack a country except in self-defense.
9830834	Russian and Chinese opposition in the UN notwithstanding, the US (not alone) with our allies will have to do something IF there is enough solid evidence of Syrian government using chemical weapons against its own people. I know we are tired of wars in that region, but the other shoe seems to have dropped in Syria, and we can organize our allies to take appropriate actions within the UN, but not unilaterally. Syrians are and have been difficult, but IF they took the steps they are alleged to have taken against their own people, no civilized country can afford to ignore that.	The US (not alone) with our allies will have to do something IF there's enough solid evidence of Syrian government using chemical weapons against its own people. Syria has hurt its own people and it should be addressed.
9831959	I like the idea of blowing up Alawite Thugs and running over Assad with a bus as much as the next contractor, but after we boot the Alawite Crips and Assad is beheaded, then we have to prevent the Islamist fascist Bloods from getting the chems, Right? We will be back in the same 4 or 5 sided Gang War we encountered in Afghanistan and Iraq. We can't kill our way out. O was dumb to draw a redline, but we have nothing to win in this one. We are Americans. We don't know who is who or What is What. The only redline should be, point any of those chems in our direction and we'll take you All Out. That's the way we roll. Iran? Same thing. If I want to send a message to a bully I punch him in the nose. Not his sister.	The US should not attack Syria as it is a mult-sided war that cannot be ended with killing. Americans should mind their own business.
9831366	Kerry's threat to punish a country that violates the US Government's sense of morality and obscenity -- in the absence of any threat to the US -- will tear US society apart. His advocacy of war to overturn the government of that disfavored country places him in something close to the posture of a colonial ruler. If the standards applied to Syria today had been applied to Iraq in the 1970's, we would have intervened in Syria back then. The USA seems to be taking a step back in time with Kerry at State.	Punishing a country that violates the US Government's sense of morality without any threat to the US will harm society. The president's actions to overturn other countries governments is akin to colonialism. The United States should not attack Syria because the same conditions existed in the past, and we did not attack then.
9829888	"The costs of inaction outweigh the significant risks of military intervention." And exactly what are these "costs of inaction". I submit that we and the Syrians will be better off if we opt for "inaction". So far our military interventions in the Middle East have had bad outcomes for ourselves and the countries we were trying to help.	Not acting would be more dangerous than intervening. I believe doing nothing in Syria is the best option for the US and Syria. Our military interventions in the Middle East always have bad outcomes for us.
10767327	The key question here is not "are polygamists deviant?" The key question is whether "child abuse and exploitation of women are not inherent in polygamy," as the author states. Professor Banks, can you site a single existing or historical example of a society that allowed polygamy but wasn't patriarchal or didn't exploit women? You can't, because there aren't any such examples. Every shred of evidence, present and past, shows that child abuse and exploitation of women ARE inherent in polygamy.	Exploitation of women and child abuse are not part of polygamy. Evident shows that polygamy comes with child abuse and exploitation.
10763639	Marriage as it pertains to government's involvement is an issue of tax law, entitlement benefits and property rights (especially in the case of divorce), government should not be defining morality. Leave morality to the churches, etc. Either government legally protects consenting adults to enter into any type of marriage and provides equal benefits in such unions, or the government completely removes itself from all marriages.	Marriage as it pertains to government's involvement should not be defining morality. The government should acknowledge all marriages, or stay out of them.
9853355	My first class came back to see if I would return--such was the nature of my terror and inexperience. It didn't take long to pick up the basics, but 42 years later I'm so much better and more consistent. I know how to be more generous and more demanding at the same time, and I know how to catch the fragile students before they tune out or disappear. And the need to innovate doesn't come from the teaching style du jour: it comes from a continuous involvement and pleasure in getting better at what you do.Experience counts.	Teachers become better and more consistent with more experience. Teachers need to have experience because as an experienced teacher I know how to catch the struggling students before they tune out or disappear. Excellence and innovation in teaching comes from continuous years spent and experience.
9848910	I am in my 9th year teaching, and yes, I feel sorry for the students I had my first year. I am a good teacher today, and it did take about 5 years to reach that point. I have never worked in a charter school, but I did once interview at one (and decline the job offer), and I know several teachers who currently work at charters. Charter schools do not offer competitive salaries. In addition, charter school teachers have more duties and longer hours in school, so, after factoring in daily lesson planning on top of their extended hours, they work much longer, in poorer conditions (the shiny buildings don't mean good work conditions) with much lower salaries. No education professional actually believes that charter schools are hiring superior teachers.	It took me 5 years to become a good teacher.
9846734	I was a public school teacher for 25 years. The large majority of teachers I observed were hacks on sinecure waiting for their pensions, resenting the students, the parents, the administration and the education professors (the last two mostly justly). There were exceptions, but not many. Enthusiasm is lost by the sixth or seventh year. One enthusiastic, dedicated young teacher is worth more to a child than many of these plodders, whose influence actually may be more negative than positive.	Experienced teachers lose their zest by the 6th or 7th year. Enthusiasm by young teachers can actually be worth more than teachers who have a negative attitude.
9844520	Teaching is a profession - we wouldn't want a doctor who wasn't educated in the profession, nor a plumber who was not trained in their profession, nor have a school constructed by someone not trained in engineering. We want a trained teacher conducting classes; outsiders coming in to supplement a lesson are fine, but not the same as a teaching professional.	As with any other profession, teachers should have some sort of classroom experience before they begin professionally teaching. Teachers with experience are not replaceable.
20926552	I agree with Princeton's move as a useful first (but small) step in addressing America's woeful inabilities to communicate around the world. But Betty is absolutely correct--the right and best place to teach foreign languages is as early as possible and over many years, while the mind is most plastic and language can be taught in the same manner we learn English--naturally, and without the mind numbing exercises that teach the infrastructure of a language--not how to actually use it.	I believe Mandatory language classes are a good beginning to increase America's communication ability.
20922752	A realistic assessment of what it takes to learn a foreign language (it takes a lifetime). All the advertising about learning a language in 3 months are nonsense. Not even the best government schools training someone 8 hours a day, 5 days a week take less than six months of total submersion to offer anything close to proficiency. And then if you don't use it, it fades quickly.	It takes a lifetime to truly learn a foreign language.
20928966	I'm old enough that I had to take 2 semesters of foreign language to graduate college. I don't remember most of it and I can't say it was a good use of my classroom time. A smattering of college language isn't much different than the high school foreign language studies required for college admission. For most people, a couple of semesters isn't enough for any fluency and ends up being largely wasted.	It was a waste of my time and I don't remember most of the language. College level foreign language classes are similar to high school level classes and shouldn't be manditory. Foreign language classes ought not be mandatory because taking a couple semester doesn't add up to fluency and is a waste of time.
20936191	As an academic for more than 50 years, I say, especially around grading time, that every university should require two things: minimal competence in a (new) foreign language, and performance on a musical instrument. You can cheat or get around the requirements for all kinds of other academic subjects, but you either speak French in public, or you can't. You either play the Bach Invention, or you can't. Simple. You can't cram it, you can't cheat. Besides the obvious benefits of the learning processes in both of these activities, the study of each is a valuable exercise in integrity. Yes, I'm serious.	They can not be cheated through like most other classes. Foreign languages are a skill that can't be cheated and must be learned and the study of them itself is a valuable experience.
20932920	rYes! And in grammar school and every year of any education. We spoke Latin in high school in public school. It was mandatory. I studied French in high school and in college and added german in college. Sure I cannot do well with my german friends, but at least I can muddle through. We need to be able to speak multiple languages and not expect everyone else to speak english. I ignored my father when I was in grammar school and he told me to learn spanish as it would be the universal language. He was right.	We should be able to speak other languages rather than expect everyone else to speak english.
20932266	Of course students should be challenged to learn another language at college. Proficiency in a second (or third) language is beside the point. The actual learning process enforces a discipline that incorporates several facets of adult education - logical thinking, memorization, multimedia exposure (video, audio, in-person interaction, etc). Learning a language creates good study and education habits.	Foreign language classes ought to be mandatory in college since proficiency can be valuable. The process of learning a language helps learn discipline as well as logical thinking, memorization and exposure to multimedia. Foreign languages teach good study habits.
20930334	Most Americans have the same attitude about languages other than their own, as they have about those people who might speak them--fear [and eventually hate]...Although I was educated in what seems like the last ice age, instruction in foreign language began in earnest in middle school and graduating with a bachelor's degree required competency in both a classical (Latin, Greek, Hebrew) and a modern language (French, Spanish, or Italian). With all the teaching aids at our fingertips now, the old curriculum should be revived. [And don't ask high schoolers what they think-just tell them what they should do.]	Americans fear and hate people who speak different languages. While in my education we were grounded in classic and modern languages since middle school allowing me more understanding. We should still be able to provide language classes with modern teaching aids.
20929638	If more learn to code, then the United States will maintain it's leading position on the world stage, resulting in English continuing to be the only language worth knowing. Let other people learn English, so they can serve us food and give us directions when we visit them, and so they can order food and ask for directions when they visit us, and do business with us. But if we want to continue to lead, we should learn to code. Other languages? Not so much. It's a waste of time. Even the Spanish speaking help knows enough English to get by.	People in the U.S. should learn to code in order to ensure the dominance of the English language. Other people should learn English. Foreign language classes are not helpful.
20928930	Both of my college-graduate children are fluent in foreign languages, learned in high school and college, fine-tuned in trips overseas: my son in German, my daughter in Spanish. Unquestionably, their foreign-language skills have been rewarded in the U.S. job market and in academia at the highest levels. We are in a new global marketplace, and America needs bilingual education now more than ever. Sorry, I must vehemently disagree with several of these very smart young writers.	Foreign language skills are rewarded in the job market. America needs bilingual education to compete in today's global marketplace.
20928908	I took my required 2 semesters of Spanish in college. I can't say I remember any of it. 2 semesters of a foreign language is required by many colleges. I'm not sure how this proposal is different. I don't think you can demand fluency in a foreign language as a graduation requirement.	I can't remember any foreign language instruction I received. Fluency can not be expected as a graduation requirement.
20927040	I think the time to learn a language is early, in elementary school. That's when being exposed to other ways of speaking, doing things, other cultures, can make such an impact. In college it's just a burden, and a very expensive burden with the cost of tuition.	Elementary school is the optimal time to learn other languages and cultures. They are an expensive bit of extra work with no true purpose.
20922649	OF COURSE ! Speaking a foreign language is absolutely wonderful ! I feel it is because of the so-called powerful place the USA occupies in the world that it has no interest in the ability to speak another language than its own. The USA would benefit from a little more humility and real understanding of the many other cultures that exist on our Earth. It enables one to assimilate a culture in a way unequaled to any other.	Learning a language is fun. American students would benefit from learning foreign languages, by being exposed to other cultures. Learning a language allows you to assimilate a culture in a way not possible by other methods.
20924395	Foreign languages have been one of the greatest gifts that a person can receive; for me French in middle and high school (still not fluent), and German beginning when I was about 27, (fluent/bilingual). I thought it was crazy when universities dropped the language requirements.	Study of language is a gift for the person that does it.
20923226	The research on this issue is clear, which the Yale provost might read ---picking up a second language in college is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for adult learners ---that is not to say that there are students who do have a talent for second language acquisition, but most of us do not. Now having said that, the odds of learning a second language increase dramatically at the elementary level. We have a habit, when discussing educational matters, of aiming curricular reforms at high school and colleges, when, we should be focused on the age groups where learning a second language is optimum---so, instead of Yale, we should be looking at enlarging dual language programs at the K - 8 system.	It is hard for an adult to learn a second language. The odds of learning a second language are higher at the elementary level. We should be teaching language in elementary school instead of college and high school.
20921716	It was a requirement in my high school in Italy. I took English and French. In later studies of engineering at a university in the USA, I had the 'audacity' for my electives to take modern English literature courses:)! It was a great opening not only for widening my intellectual horizon, but as well gaining deeper, if still not full, understanding of American society and behaviour. Saluti	Foreign languages were required in my high school in Italy. Foreign language classes ought to be mandatory because for myself it was a way to broaden my intellectual interests and gain a fuller understanding of American culture.
4592399	The NYT recently ran an article about how people lose the ability to make decisions as it gets later in the afternoon. The example given was that parole boards cease giving parole to prisoners whose cases come up in the afternoon, not because these inmated had worse cases but because , by afternoon, the human brain needs a break and decides not to decide. How does this new research fit into longer school days? Will late afternoon classes be useless? I know at work most people I know, including myself, run out of steam at about 3 p.m. If adults can't keep up to par all day, how are children expected to make decisions all day?	The school day should be shorter, as evidence shows that people do not function as well late in the day. The brain needs a break. Adults tend to begin to wear down around 3 in the afternoon, it is logical to believe that children would do the same.
4595363	People need sleep. Starting so early so there is enough daylight for a sports programs? That's why today so many of our graduates (?) are only good for sports programs... I am now 63, with 3 degrees from an ivy league school, and having run my own business for over 30 years and having had 100s of employees. I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep. Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally. Public schools shouldn't begin before 9:00 am. Period. Then we'll have better performing students and workers. Guaranteed. And don't tell	I am sure the additional hours would affect sleep patterns causing people to underperform. Everyone needs plenty of rest, school should not interfere with that.
4592576	Hear, hear. School is for learning, not for creating a schedule that will allow children to have more time for after-school sports practice (how many kids actually become successful athletes anyway?). Not to mention, a longer school day should mean less homework, resulting in a more rejuvenating downtime or creative period (by choice!) for these already-overscheduled kids. Is anyone listening out there?	The school day is long enough for academics; no extra time is needed for sports. A longer day would mean less homework.
4594455	As a public school teacher, it is not my job to raise children. They have parents for that. Dumping more and more responsibilities into the schools' laps only enables the parents who are choosing to abdicate those responsibilities. While I recognize that there are many factors that make it challenging for some parents to fully meet their children's needs (physical, emotional, educational, economic, etc.), passing those off onto schools, as Canada advocates, is not the answer. I don't think we'll see any real change in this country until we address issues like poverty and working conditions (including the long hours that force parents to choose between seeing their children and feeding them). Incidentally, I am completely baffled and frustrated by Canada, whose success comes largely from the fact that his programs have taken huge steps to improve the living conditions of his students and their families--and then he turns around and credits that success to non-unionized teachers and extended school days. Really??	It is not the job of a public school teacher to raise children - that is the parents' job. Putting more responsibilities on the schools enables parents to abdicate those responsibilities. There are many other issues such as poverty and working conditions that should be addressed over longer school days.
4593567	Aron (#36) is right. Not every part of the educational system here in the U.S. is broken. Only those parts that serve the poor are broken. Mr. Canada's suggestion might well be necessary for the schools he oversees. But most schools don't have the same problems, and for them a longer school day seems unnecessary. To bridge the achievement gap, we need to bring the bottom up. The top is for the most part where it ought to be.	Many things in the educational system in the US functions well. Many schools do not have problems requiring a longer day. The bottom end of students need to be brought to the top.
4592517	Both of my elementary age children are bored to tears at school everyday, from 8:30-3:00. In an effort to make everybody a winner, our schools have dumbed down the standards so much that our curriculum is now 2 grade levels below 20 years ago. Students have always had varying abilities, you cannot change nature. As it is school is just a place for my kids to socialize, as they learn practically next to nothing during Reading, Math, Social Studies. I wish school hours could be shortened to include only Recess, Library, Music, PE and Art so that I could have more time to teach my kids the real important stuff at home.	My children's schooldays are too long to keep their attention. Schools should improve their curriculum, not increase time in school. Students have various levels of natural ability.
4592432	Don't make the school day longer. Shorten the working hours for parents -- especially where both parents have jobs -- and let the parents spend more time with their children. The parental influence on children is the most important in their development and in their education. Besides, children need time to have fun -- just to be kids.	Children need down time to have fun and be young.
17840023	Exactly. There's no doubt that AI will continue to evolve, and the exciting possibility is that a new kind of intelligence that humans don't do well, or don't do at all, will be discovered. But simply trying to mimic human intelligence seems like a waste of time, like reinventing the wheel. Until computers decide unbidden to start writing lyrics like The Sound Of Silence and weep at the music, I'm not too concerned about AI replicating what we do.	AI is evolving and perhaps it will evolve beyond what we as humans can do. I don't think AI can write music and feel the emotion the music can evoke so I am not worried about them replicated what we do.
17848547	This is not AI. It is a program that plays a game and that is all it does. It can not interact on any other level. It has to way to view, evaluate, determine best or worse probable outcome or even to discover whether or not what it is presented with is a problem needing solution. We are a long long way from true AI. All that is possible at present is to design a program which can learn the answers we provide for it and that is not wisdom not intelligence. It is a filing system.	Artificial Intelligence can play a game and not otherwise interact. AI has the ability to determine probable outcomes, and decide if what is provided is a problem it has to solve.
11542816	Oh please, they're inducting KISS! This is not greatness, not deserving of being inducted. The RRHFA inducts too many people because it is an annual event and they need the buzz to get people to visit and keep museum viable. If they were really serious about the contributions to the genre they should only induct every 5 years. They've tossed in too many people on the periphery and diluted the value of the induction.	The Rock Hall of Fame has inducted KISS I don't think they deserve it, so it's selctions don't matter. The Rock Hall of Fame does not matter, because they are not exclusive enough in selecting people to celebrate. Hall of Fame induction is not as valuable now that many people on the periphery have been induced.
11541348	Yes! Because just like all sports, it is entertainment! The Hall's existence, and determination of honorees, gives people more things to discuss and argue about, to give them some relaxation, from their workaday lives! Only gripe I have right now, which has me all preplexed, is if you are going to call it, The Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, how can you have Rappers, whose music, if you want to call it that, is just, Talk, with an edge?! Oh, and wasn't that PBS Great Performances Special, on the Dave Clark Five, wonderful?! Now, that's enduring Rock n' Roll, which despite a few mean spirited cynics, is what made many of us, Glad All Over, then, as it still does, today!!!	Entertainment matters. The Rock Hall of fame gives people distraction from everyday life.
11540373	Brian Epstein and Linda Rondstadt are getting inductedin 2014. Who's in charge Rip VanWinckle ? Miss Rondstadt could have been inducted in the in the 70's. She was on the cover of Time magazine in 1977 and has been a Superstar ever since. Brian Epstein ?? Oh yeah I think he managed a rock Band.	Linda Rondstadt is getting inducted in 2014, but she has been a superstar for decades.
11540283	I once spent several weeks exploring Rock and Roll Hall of Fame while recovering from an injury. Pouring through the vast archives, listening at every station I was permanently enriched, inspired and even healed. The Rock hall is a ttreasure house! I am SO grateful to the Rock Hall for all they do to tell the story and preserve the sounds. And, I'll be even more grateful when they induct Gram Parsons.	Listening and exploring the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame helped me heal and I gained knowledge. The Rock Hall of Fame is a house of treasures. to tell the story and preserve the sounds.
15896079	Those already born here would, practically, have to be grandfathered if there were any changes. Reviewing the citizenship of people already born here would result in endless paperwork and heavy expenses, and would force us to make difficult moral decisions, some of which we would undoubtedly get wrong. I don't think that a constitutional amendment is actually necessary to clarify that the meaning of the Constitution is not something that it clearly was not intended to be, though. Defining the meaning of "under the jurisdiction of the United States" to exclude those who entered the country illegally or are here on short term travel visas should only require a law saying as much. The courts could strike it down, I suppose, but it's far from clear that they should, and their decision would have to explain some interesting contradictions between their position and contradictory aspects of past immigration laws. I think that the current problem is due to a lack of clarity from Congress, not due to actual demands of the Constitution.	It would be too challenging to review citzenship of people born in the United States, so the government should keep the rules as they are.
15885882	It may have made sense once upon a time but not anymore. I am liberal thinker and I don't mean to say that we need to deport people in mass or not have systems in place to care for newborns of any status who happen to be born here. But citizenship should be a priveledge that is applied for by families or legal representation in exceptional circumstances, and it should be earned thorugh a process by which it is clear the person (or family) is well invested in our culture and economy. I have two daughters born in Switzerland, neither of whom were offered Swiss citizenship at birth because the simple fact of their birth didn't make them Swiss. Under the current system it is simply too easy to take advantage of the current law and use automatic citizenship to take more than is earned. Again, I am not saying we shouldn't be a compassionate country, and how a new system is implemented would be a lengthy, difficult task, but it definitely should change.	Citizenship should be earned by people through their investment in the culture and economy. Birthright citizenship is too easy to take advantage of.
15884398	Birthright citizen cannot be found in the US Constitution or the XIV-th Amendment. Ms. Stock may be a lawyer, but she demonstrates no understanding of A1S8P4 or the 14th. Anchor babies born 40 years ago are still not citizens and that issue has not be adjudicated.	It is not in accordance with the U.S Constitution.
15881609	A national birth registry would be unnecessary if birthright citizenship were restricted to those in the country legally. Under this system, in order to obtain a birth certificate for a state, the mother would be required to provide the equivalent of an I-9 form showing her presence in this country legally.	It should only be available to those born in the country legally.
15878440	There is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment that permits birthright citizenship to non-citizens. In 1866, Senator Jacob Howard, co-author of the citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment wrote: "Every Person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States. This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons...only thru expatriation, which could be accomplished thru law alone, and not thru any immigrant acting on his own outside the law-and certainly not by any act of birth alone-could an alien become a citizen...[the] Constitution as now amended, forever withholds the right of citizenship in the case of accidental birth of a child belonging to foreign parents within the limits of the country."	The Fourteenth Amendment does not outright permit birthright citizenship. Senator Jacob Howard, in 1866, wrote an opinion that excludes foreigners born in the US from citizenship.
15875797	Reality check for those so far removed that have no idea what the issue is: Women come to the U.S. on temp visas or illegally to give birth in order to have the child become an American citizen. In some cases they stay, and in others they leave with the American child. Those that leave will eventually reap the benefits of American citizenship without ever contributing to it. It's become status symbol for foreign nationals to have children with the blue and gold passport. This is reality; and I'm sure the founding fathers didn't have this in mind when the constitution was adopted.	People are abusing the system to create American citizenship for their families. If a person leaves the US they get the benefits of citizenship with out contributing to the US. It is now just a symbol of class for people to come and have children that are citizens by birth to have the right passport.
15875591	Because this is a right conferred on the baby who has not done anything wrong, this right should not be abolished. But the parents should be stripped of the privilege of coming to the US for life, even for family reunification or aNY other purpose.	Birthright citizenship is a right of a baby who has not done anything wrong.
15894098	According to the Mexican constitution, Article 30- one way for Mexican nationality is - Those born in a foreign country of Mexican parents; of a Mexican father and a foreign mother; or of a Mexican mother and an unknown father; So if Trumps immigration plan begins with deportation for those from Mexico, it would in fact be deporting Mexican citizens...Mexico doesn't recognize them as American citizens. They are subject to the jurisdiction of Mexico.	In countries like Mexico someone born in a foreign country can still obtain citizenship if their parent(s) are Mexican.
15893089	Though I would like to agree with this article I have to disagree with it. The 14th amendment was a amendment rushed into the constitution after the civil war and it said that all people born here are citizens. The problem with this law was it was directed straight at freed slaves the writers never meant it to cover what it does today. The only way we can change that view is for it to go to the SC and say that this is what the authors meant and stop anchor babies.	The 14th amendment was rushed into the constitution. The Birthright Citizenship law was intended for free slaves, but is not applicable to today's issues.
15888131	This is a continuation of the "birthers" who still deny Barak Obama's right to be President. At some time or another, except for Native Americans, we were all "anchor babies". My question is how can Republicans (many of whom are "anchor babies") lobby to eliminate "anchor babies" to introduce themselves into women's wombs, and to prevent young people from competing in the world economy by denying them access to science, still support "small government"? When will a crowd arise that shouts, "this Emperor has no clothes!"	Every person in the United States is descended from an anchor baby. How can republicans support small government when some of whom are anchor babies are against allowing anchor babies to educated.
15882595	Stock's argument confuses me. It likely confuses her too. I favor population control everywhere. England does not need the Moslems of the East nor does France or Germany. This statement of mine should not be read as prejudice towards the MOSLEMS OF Europe. It is meant to say that if the Moslem states cannot run their business in a way that its people enjoy a reasonable standard of living for all its people it is no one else's responsibility to pick up the slack. The only exception to this broad principle might be war refugees. But people who come to the USA to deliver a child so that it can enjoy the fruits of citizenship , should not enjoy this privilege. That child is the result of two participants only one of whom resides in any sense of the word in the USA	War refugees should be the only exception to this principle. Those that come to the US solely to have citizenship conferred on their children are abusing the system. Birthright citizenship should be abolished because the child may not have two parents who even live in the USA.
15881509	We created this problem ourselves in the way we've chosen to enforce current laws. The birth of an anchor baby should never have had any bearing on whether the parents are eligible to be deported. Once we caved in to the notion of 'keeping families together', we were doomed. I am all for keeping families together. If we send the parents home they can take their children with them. We need to make that clear up front.	Having a baby shouldn't prevent illegal parents from being deported.
15877958	Not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States suggests, for example, people born in embassies, which are extraterritorial. Jurisdiction in this context is a territorial concept: i.e. where the laws can be applied. Immigrants, Legal and Illegal, tourists, students, etc. present in the united states while pregnant who deliver a child in the United States are subject to the Jurisdition of the U.S. by virtue of that presence.	People born in the United States should be given citzenships, because they are born within it's jurisdiction or territory. Immigrants have to abide by the laws of the United States.
15881775	What caste system? The Mexicans (who are most of the people abusing the sytem) who give birth here should have their kids take the nationality of the parents. They're Mexicans. Asking them to go home to Mexico and providing incentives for them to do so is hardly unfair.	Babies born here should take the nationality of the parents.
15880150	Count me a longtime fan of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, for its breadth and scope that encompasses the greatest of American values: not just defining citizenship, but setting forth states' obligations, due process, equal protection of the laws, This was the Amendment that required the states to follow the Bill of Rights. Brown v Board of Education, civil rights laws, privacy rulings, women's rights, gay rights, disability protections, they all flow from the 14th. Start tinkering, and you're risking a lot more than the status of some native-born children.	The 14th amendment is good for the country in that it keeps citizenship rights stable across the states and ensures equal treatment. There are a lot of laws based on the 14th amendment it's too risky to change it for native-born children.
18435377	I'm a psychiatrist on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University, and although I now specialize in dementia I used to work heavily in addictions and chronic mental illness. Drugs of abuse and addiction tend to move in fads, fashions, and trends, and it is important for public health that doctors' training adjust to these constant changes. At this moment the trend is opioid addiction particularly prescription drugs. The trend is moving a bit back to heroin (because it's cheaper!) but prescription drug addiction is still a huge public health problem. We (doctors) created the problem (inadvertently) and we should help solve it. A brief web-based training is not too much to ask; for many doctors it will be redundant as is much of the ongoing training we are required to participate in; but it is important to spread the word widely in the medical community.	Doctors should have opioid training so they are aware of the drugs being abused. People are addicted to prescription opioids. Opioid training should be mandatory because prescription drug abuse is a public health problem. Since doctors are responsible for the issue, they should help address it. Short, web-based training would be helpful to doctors.
18432416	The author assumes the conclusion about education on opioids- without providing evidence. Like Ioannidis said we have an epidemic of opinions in medicine today. Some studies have shown that education in opioids improves care. There is also studies showing education on pain care improves pain care. Education on opioids will miss the mark, in my opinion, if the goal is to improve pain care and prevent addiction to opioids. It is clear doctors do not wish to have education in either pain care or on opioids- as statements by the AMA and aafp and efforts by the MSSNY are indicative of. But being a doctor is not a god given right and society has the right to dictate to those who want to be doctors what education they need to obtain and maintain their license. So we should try to reeducate doctors in both using opioids and in pain care- its morally right and there is evidence that it can improve care.	Studies have shown opioid training improves care. Doctors should have education in pain care or opioids. Doctors need to be held to nationwide educational standards to get and keep their licenses. Doctors should be educated in opioids to improve care.
18434538	I'm a severe brain injury survivor (Grade 5 SAH). When dropped to inpatient sub acute care a gerontologist treating me prescribed Percocet for pain. I refused any medication other than prescribed by my neurosurgeon. In my situation a phone consultation with my neurosurgeon would have been best practice. Percocet could have destroyed any chance I had to regain neurological and cognitive function.	Because of my experience with pain prescriptions, I would have benefited from consultation with a neurosurgeon. Medicines can destory neurological functions.
18434209	Patients should also have to undergo mandatory training. I have used opioids for 12 years and I have not increased that amount in all that time because I studied up on pain medication and addiction. Not one doctor over that time told me one thing that I learned in my own. I know more than most doctors. Doctors are passing out pills they don't understand and their patients have even a less understanding how to use them. No wonder why there is a big problem.	Doctors should be trained because mine have not provided that information. Doctors do not fully understand the medications they are prescribing.
18432595	Maybe part of this training would include to not withhold pain relief from those who suffer from conditions that are painful on a daily basis. It seems all the hysteria on the misuse of opioids has given rise to more government control in the doctor's office. The majority of patients who take these drugs take them responsibly. They do not take them for the high, they take them for just enough relief to help maintain normal function. Let's not make doctors afraid to take care of the suffering they encounter, let's help them learn to distinguish between the budding addict and the the poor soul who is legitimately suffering.	Training should include not withholding pain relief form those who suffer pain daily. The hysteria on misuse of opioids has put the government in more control of the doctor's office. The majority of opioid patients take the drugs responsibly. We don't need to make doctors afraid of caring for patients.
18432065	DR Ballantyne- Sydenhams views no longer apply to modern medicine- we have treatments now- like platelet rich plasma, LENS neurofeedback, stem cell therapy, German new medicine, neural prolotherapy, oxidized ATP, MitoQ, ESWT, acupotomy- that you and your colleagues need to learn to help people in pain. No doubt the overuse of opioids has stemmed from the moral laziness of doctors when it came to offer the right care for people in pain. Doctors and medicine is still remiss in developing and deploying good treatment for pain. And training based on the little that pain specialists know and do will be of too little help to people in pain. Its time for Ballantyne to call for raising standards of care for all involved in pain care. And lets not maketoo much out of past treatments for the prevalence of pain is on the rise.	There are many treatments that doctors need to learn to help people in pain. Opioid training will help stop lazy doctors from over prescribing for pain. The medical field needs to develop a better treatment for pain.
18428098	Why are the trade names for these medications suddenly taboo in the news? Are the reporters for some reason not allowed to say Percocet, Vicodin, Hydrocodoe, suddenly, just like they were not allowed to say 'torture' . And of course, training is required. Doctors shoveled Hydrocodone at me after my back operation, 240 pills, and I needed exactly zero. It was weird. Not only that, an intelligent nurse took me off hydrocodone while I was in the hospital, saying it was not having a good effect on me, and that should have guided the exit prescriptions, also, instead of just getting the xerox copy from the already written doctors wrote orders. Doctors are not allowed to divorce their brains from their profession, despite the obvious example Ben Carson showed us of what type of skills make one a top surgeon.	Doctors gave me Hydrocodone that I didn't need after a back operation. A smart nurse took me off hydrocodone because it wasn't affecting me well and that is what should have determined what prescriptions I was given when I left the hospital.
18427965	I see no reason why this has to be an either or situation. Doctors should be trained about the prescribing of opioids as it is apparent that they are either ignorant or negligent in their prescribing practices. Imagine a doctor having the ability to check to make sure a patient isn't getting more than one prescription for an opioid by going to a computer and looking it up but chooses not to....is that good medicine? Somebody needs training or maybe they just need their licenses pulled!	They should be trained since they are currently negligent or ignorant as see in their practice of prescribing.
13238401	The right to vote is enumerated more than any other right. And while no right is absolute, this right is, or should be, easier to exercise than any other right. Barriers to vote such as those enacted here in North Carolina serve no purpose other than to disenfranchise citizens. These barriers exist in many forms, with the photo ID requirement being the tip of the disenfranchisement iceberg. These tactics abridge not only the right to vote, but violate the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, and create the very taxation without representation that the founders rebelled against.	The right to vote should be easier to exercise than other rights. Some of the rules for voting are simple barriers that only make voters less likely to vote. Voting should be a right because tactics are being used to infringe on voters without a constitutional protection. If it is not then we will be returning to the type of government the US rebelled against.
13241735	Please name one First World country that does not require a strict I.D. to vote, not to mention the same requirement in numerous Second and even Third World countries. For the left to claim that asking blacks and Latino citizens to provide valid, photo I.D.s, despite the necessity of having such to engage in ordinary life in America, is to say that they are malignantly stupid and detached, as if Algonquin J. Calhoun and Lightnin' were representative of ordinary minority folk.	IDs are required to vote. It is stupid to ask citizens to provide ID since you need an ID to be an  ordinary American.
13244428	The liberals' contributions to this section are basically saying that two Articles and four Amendments will fix what two Articles and three Amendments haven't. Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not. They'll end up simply voting for the first name, and when that is a GOPer, we'll have to keep watch over the bridges in the big-city liberal-statist philosophical ghettos/campuses.	It should be something for the private sector. If you don't trust the judicial system to protect voters an amendment won't help anyways. People should not be forced to vote when all they are interested in is trivial things.
13239026	It was never about the ID but about the roadblocks put in place to keep certain groups of people from ever obtaining the 'chosen' ID. With rules like the ID has to have an expiration date on it or it is invalid or requiring several copies of documents then raising the cost of those copies ten fold or the need for bills in the person's name with the physical address so that renters and people with post office boxes and married women could be kept from getting the ID. We all know what is really going on, the only solution looking for a problem is voter fraud claims by republicans. It is just an excuse to let the worst people in the country skate unhindered into office by cheating and discriminating. Shame on you for all the lies and deceptions that you put in this piece and shame on NYT for allowing you to do it.	It is about keeping certain people from voting, not about simple ID. The worst people get into office easily by cheating and discriminating.
13236705	The guarantee that voting shall not be denied on account of race, sex, or age for citizens 18 or older, is not a guarantee that voting shall not be denied on account of not having a drivers license or gun permit, for having had a past felony, or for having recently moved. We need an affirmative right to vote, not just a prohibition on certain forms of voting restrictions.	Voting ought to be a constitutional right because the guarantee shouldn't be denied based on various factors such as race, sex or age for citizens 18 or older. We currently just have a stop on certain restrictions, what we need is open voting for everyone across the board.
13238515	I believe that the right to vote is sufficiently enumerated without having to go through the amendment process. Instead of another amendment, we need elected officials who take seriously their obligation to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies - including those who would disenfranchise millions of American citizens. We need judges who clearly understand that a requirement to present one's driver's license at the polls violates the 24th amendment, as the driver's license fee is a tax. We need to rise up against efforts to disenfranchise college students through various technicalities in residency requirements as violations of the equal protection clause. Here in North Carolina, the NAACP, led by Rev. William Barber, rose up against the draconian voter suppression laws in the Moral Monday movement that swept our state. This movement needs to continue to grow, to rival the NRA is political power as the voice to protect our 15th/19th/24th/26th amendment rights.	The Constitution provides criteria that adequately ensures the right to vote -- therefore, there is no need to add an amendment. Driver's license fees violate the 24th amendment.
13249305	The Constitution needs no amending. Very simply, if a person has no photo ID, which, in today's society, makes their alleged inability to vote the least of their problems. then the states should supply one free of charge and just for voting. I doubt the cost would be that substantial to the states as I doubt this is as large a group as the NYT would have us believe. Beyond that, when, in many elections, less than 20% of the registered voters bother to show up in the first place, it would seem that we as voters suppress ourselves far more effectively than any voter ID laws.	Less than 20 percent of registered voters show up to vote in some elections in the first place.
13240880	What amazes me in this argument is that so many people in our country are more concerned about supposed voter fraud than they are in what such rules do to those who should be involved in the process. As americans, don't we all want as many people to vote as possible? Isn't that what our country is all about? Not winning, but participation? We should all be striving to get as many people to vote as possible.	The more people that vote, the better it is for America, a country defined by the participation of all.
13240864	There are always restrictions in society for the greater good of society. Should we allow our votes to be invalid by letting people who are not US citizens vote? Certainly not. All societies that want to survive and safeguard their culture should have restrictions on voting.	Voting  should be restricted to protect society.
13239708	I don't think we need an amendment. What we need are policies to make it as easy as possible to vote. No more nonsense such as moving polling places off college campuses. limiting voting hours to narrow windows of time, decreasing the number of polling places so people must wait hours to vote, and any other shifty tactics I'm missing in this list. These are the tactics that make me increasingly uneasy about the integrity of elections in the U.S.	An additional amendment is not necessary to protect voting rights. Polling places should be widely available.
13237789	Being born in the US and breathing should not be the only criteria for voting. Having a clue should be a criterion. Anyone wishing to vote should pass the same English and civics test that a person has to take when becoming naturalized. Why should a native born be more ignorant about our government than a naturalized citizen? Does anyone remember the Jay Leno or Waters World interviews? And while we are at changing the Constitution, here are a few other changes needed re politicians: 1) Term limits for members in all three branches 2) Finance reform 3) Outlawing revolving door politicians/lobbyists 4) Return of the universal draft with politicians' offspring at the top of the harms way list.	There should be more prerequisites to voting than being alive. Voters should be educated. No one should be allowed to vote unless they can pass a test. Natives can be just as ignorant as naturalized citizens.
13237294	It's simple. We need a national biometric id system that allows humans to show up at the polls and present themselves to vote. The idea that only the members of the 'master race' can vote will only lead to trouble.	People need a national ID with biometrics so that they can vote when they arrive at the polls. If only 'master race' members vote, will only lead to trouble.
13236679	I am for a constitutional amendment to make voting a right. We currently disenfranchise citizens residing abroad (who can not vote in state elections), at colleges (they are often not considered residents of the state where they are at college, the incarcerated and those who are convicted of felonies. Voting is a right that should never be taken away.	Voting rights should be taken more seriously, and extended to those who are disenfranchised or for whom voting is challenging. Voting is a necessary right.
13237296	Absolutely agree. With more and more obstacles put in the way of people voting and those who vote wondering if they can trust that their votes will be counted accurately -- we need a nationally uniform and guaranteed system of voting in the U.S. Countries like Australia and Canada have more voting safeguards -- and it's time we have them too. Voting should be a universal right.	With more and more obstacles to voting and accusations of voter fraud America should follow Australia and Canada's lead and put more safeguards in place.
12727505	America's sport? Of course they should pay taxes, like any profit making corporate entity. Another aberration of our tax code that our legislators provide for the wealthy, privileged, connected and very unworthy, few. Ouch! I got a concussion thinking about it.	They make profits there fore they should pay taxes. Tax brake provided by the law for few wealthy people.
12727454	no no and hell no - when cities and states give breaks and build stadiums for this 'non-profit' league but turn off water to ordinary citizens or threaten more cuts to the floor of existence - where the heck is our sense of community of compassion and care - not for ordinary folks - who can afford a ticket let alone the drain from infrastructure..... argh! Pay for your own playgrounds NFL - you are knocking brains apart - no wonder you make the decisions you do!	States should not give breaks and build stadiums for "non-profits" but give more cuts or turn off water to ordinary citizens. We need compassion and care for ordinary people.
12727262	At this juncture, with government at all levels struggling to pay for basic services while racing to the bottom regarding tax rates, there is little economic or business justification for treating the NFL more favorably when it comes to tax exemptions or tax rates. If anything, one could argue that entertainment activities like professional sports should be subject to surtaxes to help subsidize activities which are much more important to society, e.g., education, roads, communications, public safety.	Government is already struggling to pay for basic needs. Professional sports should be subject to a surtax to pay for societal expenses like education, roads, etc.
13122967	'Nonprofit' is a misnomer mainly used in the USA. The rest of the English-speaking world typically talks about 'not-for-profits'. Interestingly, the IRS also uses extensively the term 'not-for-profit', apparently interchangeably with 'nonprofit'. All nonprofits and not-for-profits need to aim to do better than break even, and create at least a small surplus, in a fiscal year in order to buffer them against a loss in the next. Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. The issue is clouded by the fact that most Americans and others evidently don't understand what a nonprofit or not-for-profit is.	A firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit, cannot distribute the profit to shareholders. Sports should operate for profit.
12727120	A have a two word solution to the tyranny of billionaire team owners- eminent domain. The value of franchises are sky high because of the ego factor. All the billionaires want one. If they can't be moved nilly willy then they can't extract ransoms from politicians who don't want it to happen to them. Cities, counties or states can lease the rights to manage them to individuals, but they should be held in the commons. Fans pay more and more to attend games, TV audiences sit through unbearable commercials (watch a soccer game- no interruptions) cable costs escalate unendingly. The 49ers priced their blue collar fans out of their new stadium without so much as a thanks. Greed and hubris. I hope I live to see it collapse. I no longer subscribe to cable TV and are trying to wean myself off the game, as well as their minor league (NCAA) offerings.	The franchises are way too valuable. Fans pay to attend games and sports leagues get paid for advertisements.
12724989	It makes sense for healthcare and education to have special status. My family benefits directly and indirectly from these services. I receive no benefits whatever from sports. I never watch sports events on television and never attend a sporting event unless someone gives me free tickets.	No one benefits from sports leagues. Sports do not personally benefit myself.
12730742	Zimbalist tortuously describes distinctions without differences to arrive at his unwarranted conclusion. If we are taxing corporations, none should be tax-exempt. Period! The tax code is to raise revenue, not to institute social policies. Those, if deemed desirable, should be done through appropriations, where our representatives will have to justify their choices with each budget. Unfortunately, the tax code is much like military bases, pork spread so widely that no one wants to rock the boat, even if the totality is detrimental to the welfare of our country.	Sports leagues are corporations and should be taxed as so. The tax code is not to institute social policies.
12724991	I have long said that professional sports should not benefit from extra benefits in terms of tax relief of any kind. This includes cities providing any tax break or incentives to build their arenas. We, the taxpayers of San Antonio, built a domed stadium for an NFL team. We now have the white elephant downtown and we still wait for the NFL that will never come. Not that I would pay money to see them.	Professional sports should not benefit from tax relief. The taxpayers of San Antonio built an NFL stadium that sits unused downtown with no NFL team playing there.
12727180	The problem is mobility, and that the individual teams are unregulated utilities. They use mobility and regional loyalty to extract concessions from cities and states or counties. Cities should use eminent domain to seize teams and offer fixed period leases to individuals to manage them. No politician wants to lose a team on their watch, so they willingly pay ransoms. Teams belong to regions, not egotistic billionaires.	They use their home turfs love for them to get things from the cities or counties they reside in. Those who run teams should lease them from the cities who should own them. Sports leagues should not be nonprofit because they extort money from local politicians who are afraid to lose the status symbol of a national team. They should be owned by the regions they reside in, not elite billionaires.
18692186	More guns are not the solution to on or off campus safety. Bullet-Riddled Bodies Do Not Lie. GUNS KILL. Get them off the Streets of America. WE must DEMAND that EVERY gun in America be registered on a national database, state licensed and fully insured for liability. NOW is them time.	More guns will not provide more safety. Guns kill people.
18692151	Ms. Collins must not realized that most guns carried by women are used against them - not tor protect themselves. Bullet-Riddled Bodies Do Not Lie. GUNS KILL. Get them off the Streets of America. WE must DEMAND that EVERY gun in America be registered on a national database, state licensed and fully insured for liability. NOW is them time.	They are used against themselves when carried by women.
18719443	"Should guns be allowed on campuses" is a perverse question. I would like to ask first: are guns allowed in colleges anywhere else in the world? Are more student dying there as a result of shootings? The answer of course is NO in both cases. Did anyone really need to debate about this? Just the idea that someone can think about something like this is sick and a sign of a dangerous deterioration of the expectations we as a so called civilized society have about each another. The other question is: why are so many shootings happening in USA campuses? Why are Americans in such pain that they need to overdose on opioids or/and shoot each other?	Guns aren't allowed on campuses anywhere else in the world. Even thinking about allowing guns on campus is deranged and shows that our society is not as civilized as we think.
18705701	I posted to this column yesterday and read the comments. Then today we have the Unspeakable sadness of another University shooting. There are simply too many guns out there and sensible gun control is needed across the board along with Community Mental Health and anger management treatment options. Meanwhile no guns on campus please.	Sensible gun control, mental health services, and anger management treatment options are needed across the board.
18694894	My daughter is a college professor who just left employment at a well-known Tennessee university. She gets emails from one or two disgruntled students at the end of every semester complaining about the grade she gave them. What is to stop any of these teenagers, who are proven to have an undeveloped frontal lobe and thus lack the capacity for realizing the consequences of their choices, from bringing a gun to her readily accessible office and shooting her? The student may go to jail, but my daughter will be dead. That is my fear.	Teenagers may not have the best capacity for well thought out decisions and should not have free access to guns.
18693756	Here's the bottom line. People with concealed carry permits have been background-checked and vetted by the state, for both character and competence. They carry on streets, in supermarkets, theatres, restaurants, public transportation, workplaces, and most other places you frequent every day. You may not be aware of it, but they are there. The question you have to ask yourself is, what is so magical about an imaginary line around a college campus that suddenly changes people who are not a public danger outside that line? Other states have been allowing legal weapon on campus for most of a decade, and have had zero incidents. This is nothing but phobia, pure and simple. If you think that universities are somehow naturally constitution-free zones, this says something about you that you may want to reconsider.	Concealed carry permit holders have already been background checked and vetted for both character and competence. Guns should be allowed on college campuses because they are already allowed in many other public places. Guns are already on college campuses. An imaginary line around a college campus will not suddenly change people who are not a public danger outside the line. Guns should be allowed on campus because it has been allowed in other states with no problems. You should reconsider if you think Universities don't have to uphold constitutional rights.
18693252	As a University professor in New York I feel protected by the laws that do not permit concealed or open carry of firearms. If I were living in a State where this were permitted I would find another job or simply quit. But before I caved, I would organize a boycott of classes. I believe that the vast majority of professors would also refuse to work. I could be wrong but it's a deal breaker for me: I will not have guns in my classroom. And if the State thinks that's okay, I'm going to live somewhere else because nothing about civilians with guns is safe. Nothing.	As a professor, I feel safer because of laws restricting firearms on campus. Many professors would refuse to work, they would not condone guns in their classrooms. Guns should not be permitted on college campuses or anywhere else because it makes me feel unsafe.
18692176	A friend of mines father lost his leg fighting in Germany [Battle of the Bulge]. He never owned any firearms ever after the war......and scarcely spoke of it. Having to kill others with guns changes your life forever.... That's what war does. Do we really want to make universities feel like a war zone...... If you think having a classroom of armed students is going to make learning better.... Good Luck.	Killing other people will forever change who you are. Guns on campuses would make a hostile environment.
13556994	What is the outcome of those students expelled from charter schools? Where do they go and where do they end up? I see the extra suspensions in charter schools as a failure of the business model and as a business, they should be liable for the results and restitution from the charter school is in order.	Extra suspensions in charter schools are a failure of their business model and should be liable for results and restitution.
13573791	There a debate about this? Of course charter schools are cherry picking. I live right in the middle of charter school and quasi-charter school heaven in Arizona, and cherry picking is exactly what's going on. If the parent's not engaged, the child doesn't get in in the first place. If the child's not engaged or disruptive, the child is O-U-T out, pronto.	Charter schools are cherry picking. Where I live, I see them cherry-picking all the time.
13562397	Did anyone expect this NOT to happen? Charter schools are a failed experiment in new ways to discriminate against the poor and minority. Ban such schools, or at least refuse to give one single dime to schools that discriminate like this. Lay down the law with these schools that invent new ways to do evil.	Charter schools discriminate against the poor and minorities.
13562241	I am a NYC teacher who has taught in public, charter and now private school. My two children attend a gifted and talented public school and private school. I would never send my child to a charter school. Why? Because they will never learn how to be creative, independent and self reliant. Some of my best students have defied me in their writing, their words and their actions, albeit respectfully. In a Charter environment that is grounds for reprimand, suspension and expulsion. Any parent reading this should support local public schools and fight for more G&T programs and AP programs. Supporting Public School is the only way to ensure that we have a strong active middle class. If you do not believe me name any politician, middle management executive or faculty member whose children attend a Charter School. I rest my case.	Charter schools only focus on certain attributes. The best students, who sometimes defy teachers in writing and actions, would be reprimanded, expelled or suspended in a Charter School. Politicians, and executives don't send their children to charter schools so we need to support public schools so we have a strong middle class.
13557962	YES. The other way some of them cherry pick is through their faux lotteries. At Success, the first round of the lottery uses a computer algorithm to choose kids; when those families decline or are found ineligible, Success doesn't have to blindly choose anymore - they can go into the 'wait list' pool and select the kids they think will have the fewest academic, behavioral, language, or special needs issues.	Charter schools select on the best students. Faux Lotteries are just a form of cherry picking. By using a computer algorithm, schools such as Success can select the least problematic kids, leaving students with special needs or challenges left behind.
13563613	This looks like a half solution. We need to start by acknowledging that students who want to learn need an environment where they can. Charter schools can do a good job of this. But the other half of the problem - what happens to the disruptive students also needs to be addressed adequately. Dumping the troubled students is not a solution for the dumpees. The reasons for disruptive behavior are wildly varied. We need to be willing to take the next step and work with them too, on their level(s) to bring them along. And yes, they probably will be more costly to educate than charter school students, as they are undoubtedly needier.	Charter schools are not supportive environments for kids. Charter schools getting rid of problem students creates more problems.
13559400	Just don't bother to tell me that charter schools are successful because they are better when they succeed by kicking out any child they want to get rid of for any reason they want. And just because the schools you so admire in the past for being run by uneducated sadists doesn't make it right. There's something truly sick about admiring the schools that beat children and kick them out for any behavioral infractions.	Charter schools are at liberty to exclude any child for any reason. It's not right to admire schools that kick kids out of school for poor behavior.
13558963	What is most galling about the advocates and activists who insist on the right of the most disruptive kids to endanger their peers and compromise their education is the fact that they would never tolerate such behavior at the economically stratified schools where they send their own children. When was the last time a first-grader at a high-end Manhattan, Westchester, or Nassau private or public school picked up a chair over their head and threw it at a classmate, or told the teacher, using several of George Carlin's seven words, to perform an anatomically impossible act?	The people who advocate for kids with behavior issues would never allow such behavior at the rich schools they send their kids to.
4266102	Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people. As distinguished professor Harlan Lane notes in his current book, "People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry" viewing Deaf and hard of hearing people as a disabled group ignores the history/traditions, language, social mores and customs of generations of Deaf people. Much of the language, history, and customs which have been carried through Deaf schools and provided Deaf people with access to a truly well-rounded education. In the 1988 Congressional Report on the Commission on the Education of the Deaf one of the primary findings was the problem which "has arisen related to the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act is widespread misinterpretation of the "Least Restrictive Environment" concept. Too often deaf children have been place in improper educational settings because educational agencies have prioritized placement with nonhandicapped children...(pg. 10) As many of us in the field have noted "inclusion is illusion," that is physical proximity does not assure interaction....and an appropriate education, therefore, is NOT guaranteed to Deaf students via PL 94-142 nor IDEA.	Deaf schools have always aided those special needs people well throughout history. Differing interpretations of the Education of All-Handicapped Children's Act leads to difficulties in teaching the deaf. If deaf children are sent to school with non-deaf kids they are not guaranteed a proper education.
4264489	As a hard of hearing person and now a educator of the deaf, I too believe that parents should have a choice, however, it should be an informed choice that most parents do not have. What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone. Now I know sign language and am able to communicate without a problem, but it took many years to learn. I am a firm believer that child should be taught both, sign language and have speech therapy in hopes to use everything they can to communicate with others.	Deaf students need more specialized education. Children should be taught sign language and speech therapy protocols.
4373275	When I read all the different opinions on this topic, I can boil it down to two statements. 1) The cost of farm labour is a small faction of the eventual cost of foods. 2) The current American agricultural system vitally depends on having a supply of unskilled labourers who are willing to work seasonal jobs with long, grueling hours, unsafe conditions, and little to no chance of advancement. A sufficient pool of people does not exist among legal American workers.	Farm labor only costs a portion of the cost of food production. Farms depend on having a supply of unskilled workers who will work seasonal jobs with long hours and bad conditions without advancement opportunities. There aren't enough American citizens willing to work on farms.
4371377	I don't see much real data in this. What kind of economist does that? Real economists who have really looked at this have discovered that the actual cost at retail of not using illegal labor is very small, under 5%. The actual farm labor costs are swamped by capital costs, storage, transportation and distribution, spoilage and retail markup. In addition, there are visa programs for temporary seasonal workers that would allow farmers to get what they claim they need, but they would then have to provide less exploitative wages and conditions.	Farms could survive without illegal labor because economic studies reveal that not having available illegal labor only costs 5% of profits. Most of the labor costs on farms aren't as bad as their other costs. Visa programs for temporary workers would help farmers.
4367203	I see one assumption here that creates a false hindrance to finding solutions. I would think that an apple grower with no harvest labor would very wiling to replant to mechanically harvestable trees. There is no value in having trees whose many apples never leave the orchard. The exception, and perhaps the reason for making the assumption, are those growers who are so stubborn that they would rather go out of business thinking themselves proven right. But that is not the attitude that made Washington apple growers so successful.	Growers could replant mechanically harvestable trees.
4370679	There are plenty of middlemen who would garner their profits on the increased wages. None would forego their cut -- and the retailer gets the largest share of that. Just when we are finally paying serious attention to getting people to eat more fruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the costly obesity our society is suffering from, with all its attendant effects. If more people could employ themselves on farms, we might have a better outcome. But our incentives are not set up to promote that. Correct the incentives. We don't need more factory farms.	Many would profit on the increased wages. Only if more people were able to employ themselves.
4367468	The only way to attract Americans to work in the farms is to (1) pay the workers a decent wage; (2) make the job year-round, not just seasonal; (3) provide health insurance benefits; and (4) offer 401K opportunity. The prices of fruits and vegetable will go up. But as Professsor Philip Martin points out, the net cost to the consumers will be minimal. Society will benefit because more Americans will be taken off the unemployment roster and will be paying income tax.	Farms need to offer fair wages to workers, with year round jobs with benefits to get rid of illegal labor. It would cause an increase in price on farmed goods, but it will be minimal. Without illegal labor, more Americans would have jobs and would pay income tax.
4367117	It's nice to know that farmers following the law would have positive economic effects but more importantly, they are breaking the law and conspiring to break the law for their benefit and the detriment of the american worker. Let's focus on puting these crooked farmers in jail and on deporting the illegals. Both hurt the american worker.	Farmers are breaking the law for their own benefit and the detriment of American workers.
4366654	Or farming of this type would just move to mechanization to keep costs down. In the late 70s/early 80s, the United Farm Workers did a lot to prevent academic research into mechanization of California farming, and wanted the state to impose taxes on mechanized fruit and vegetable harvesters. I think their efforts even included a terrorist attack on the Ag-engineering department at UC-Davis (although maybe that's just something I just heard?). But it's 2011, and I doubt they are strong enough to stop mechanization these days.	Farms should use mechanization to reduce costs.
4366425	Of course their salaries should be raised. But this should be separated from the discussion about legality. Salaries should be raised and only legal workers should be employed. Its really a no brainer. And any discussion about only Mexicans being prepared to do this work so it has to be illegal is completely disingenuous.	Salaries should be raised and only legal workers should be employed. It is disingenuous that only Mexicans are prepared to do this work.
4378367	This is similar to the question could the south have abolished slaver before the civil war and still be able to grow and harvest cotton at a competitive price. The idea that you have to have a captive labor force, poor working conditions and starvation wages is born out of greed not need. Big business drives illegal immigration and the transfer of American jobs to China. An increase in the regulation of farming hiring practices, especially corporate farming and a high enough foreign profits tax to make bringing jobs home worthwhile would surely improve the employment numbers.	Having a captive labor force is being greedy.
4373519	Management has used this same cost argument aganist every labor safety and welfare issue. I worked in the newspaper printing industry. Every safty device had to be won in a negotiated fight. Illegals have no political strength. That's why they have to accept low wages and illegal living conditions. Shame on us. We tried to do the same with the Chinese when we were done having them build our railroads and mine our gold and build Folsom Prison. They still have an area in Folsom called China Hill. That's were all the unmarked graves are of Chinese workers who died building the stone walls of Folsom.	Other industries have claimed that paying fair wages and providing a safe working environment would harm their industry, but that did not bear out. Immigrants have no political strength.
4373374	Several people have commented on Americans being unwilling to pick crops, in part because of low wages and benefits. Why should taxpayers be paying people up to 99 weeks of unemployment benefit so they can sit on their backsides? What happened to the idea that beggers can't be choosers?	Beggers can't be choosers.
4371398	This nation is going to have to admit that its tradition of luring more than a million poor unskilled immigrants to this country a year, with the express purpose of exploiting them with below living wage wages (and then taxing our dwindling middle class to get social service subsidies needed to keep them alive), is complex comoflaged form of slavery that is no more moral than the formal black slavery that so oppressed and humiliated our nation. It must stop now. If we have to pay a bit more for food so be it. No one accepts former complaints that ending black slavery would raise the cost of cotton cloth, so why do we dare mention the cost of ending agricultural worker slavery. Mechanize these picking jobs and pay American workers a decent wage to do the work of several immigrant slaves as we have done in every other industry. Farmers and other businesses who can not make a profit without slave labor should go out of business or get into another business.	The market can support higher food costs. No one accepted the argument that ending slavery would raise the cost of farming, why should illegal labor be subject to this argument?. There are machines that can do the illegal labor. We could pay Americans a fair wage to do the work of a few poorly paid immigrants just like every other employment field. Farmers and businesses who cannot make money without illegal labor should shut down businesses.
4371131	Justifying Illegal workers on the cheap products they produce is just another example of privatize the benefits but socialize the costs. The benefits come to mainly the business owners who can produce cheaper products and their by increase their profit margin. Plus the works are less likely to complain if they are mistreated. However the poor old taxpayer is left to pay for the schools, the health care, food stamps etc, etc for these people and yes the baby delivery costs as they all try to have that anchor baby. Massive illegal immigration has become a disaster for the US that will permanently change it forever. Maybe the US should just give up and cede the Southern States of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to Mexico.	Illegal labor primarily benefits business owners who increase their profit margin by using illegal labor. Illegal immigration is bad for the United States.
4370444	There would be very little difference in the price of fruits and vegetables if the farmers paid a reasonable wage. They'd need to do it together to not harm each other in the food market, that's what the unions and cooperatives are for. And we really need to license the labor contractors. So that they lose their licenses if they don't provide adequate water and toilets to workers in the fields. No farmer wants a dead worker featured in their harvest. It brings a farmer's competency into question among the community. Mostly, farmers who pay less than good wages are megafarms and cheaters. They like illegal aliens because they can unload the costs associated with hiring workers onto the neighboring communities. And because these workers are less likely to know and object when they are being exposed to pesticides or abuse.	Farmers could pay a reasonable wage and there would be very little difference in the price or fruits and vegetables.
4368285	Totally agree with this view, but I have not heard any comments pertaining the posture of Big Farming and their supporters. Regardless I will gladly pay the higher price of vegetables if I new it helps a family owned business.	I agree with this. People would be willing to pay more if it meant small family owned businesses would benefit.
4367597	There is a country-wide stigma against agricultural work. Part of that is due to hold overs from the slavery period. Part of that is due to a perception of minimum wage or less work. What we really need, and are seeing in some of these younger farmers, is a new class of people. People who are extremely intelligent, very hard working, who understand mesh networks, cellular and microbiology, organic chemistry, geology, hydrology, pest control, and synergistic relationships. And we need to get the word out that that's what this new age of farming is all about, and not using ignorant, illegal immigrants.	Farms and farmers should focus on technology and science to move past the problem of using uneducated illegal labor.
4367042	Factor in the cultural negatives, the governmental (read taxes and free social services) impact, the educational costs (ESL? English is the language of our country.), the crime and the continuing ghettoization of cities (albeit just another sign of the failure of multiculturalism) and most folks would be happy to pay more at the greengrocer for US citizen-picked produce. The mantra of 'jobs Americans don't want' leaves out the 'at that pay' aspect.	There are cultural negatives to illegal labor, like governmental and educational costs. People would be willing to pay more money for produce picked by US citizens. Pay rate affects if an American will accept a job over an illegal immigrant.
4375222	Mining is also an intolerable job, but people do it because they are paid much more than they could make at any other available job, I believe about $60K/year which is good money in the poor parts of the country. LOTS of jobs are difficult and/or dangerous but they pay enough to attract people, at least people who don't readily have better options. This is STRICTLY a matter of wages. For $60K/year, I betcha lots of people would learn to pick vegetables and fruit.	If farmers only paid workers a reasonable wage I can see many people taking these jobs.
4368020	Ms. Bedolla's job is to lobby for illegal workers, and this fact makes all of her arguments subject to question. This is standard advocacy talk- the illegal's do the work American's won't do/can't do, and her Georgia example where former convicts, hardly a representative population, were cited as evidence is typical of the distortions practiced by these advoctes. If the farmers want legal workers, then they should pay them a living wage, and Americans should pay the higher resulting prices for the food that they consume .The implication that American's are not hard workers is not borne out by our history.	Farmer's should pay viable wages to American workers despite the higher prices that would result, America's history shows they will do the work.
14666541	What can we expect in our Cowboy culture? We celebrate power and violence; they are part of our national conscience. Endemic bias and the violence forged by it are logical outcomes of our celebration of subjugation. Additionally, we confuse courage with aggression--maintaining home arsenals in the name of protection is not courage; courage requires a willingness, if not acceptance, of defeat.	Power and violence are part of our national conscience. Courage is often confused with aggression.
14663382	First, I'd like to point out that the original question makes no sense. The behavior is aberrant, not the murder charges. However, I'm sure those of us who object to the aberrant behavior of our police forces surmise that events, like this one, have happened thousands of times, all over this country, without video evidence. Yes, there should be a federal database that goes back, in time, to at least the 1964 Civil Rights Act.	We assume police are using excessive force all over the US and it is not recorded.
14672166	If they dress like robo-cop warriors they will want to act that way. Polite, no. Intimidating, yes! When we visited China the first thing I noticed was that their visible police were UNARMED! It is simply not their job to routinely threaten to shoot anyone who violates their orders. Only a SWAT or military unit can respond to any violence. Thus there is far less confrontation with deadly force. Disarm the regular beat cops. Let them go back to friendlier dress and personal presence to see that the law is respected.	If police dress aggressively, they will act aggressively. More casual dress and a friendlier attitude would help people respect the law.
14668450	Why does it take a video of a blatant example of a cop shooting a black man to convince the nay sayers that the cops are racist and out of control?! Show me a video of a cop shooting a white guy under similar circumstances that we've witnessed over the past year and I'll shut up. You can't because it simply does not happen.	Police disproportionately target people of color.
14666422	There are bad cops just like there are bad soldiers. When someone get's a license to use a gun in war or to protect our streets, they can easily lose their cool and not hesitate to take out their anger with their weapon. Its never excusable in either scenario. My guess is, though, that criminals are by far much more likely than police officers to use deadly force, and that by far is a bigger problem than the few bad cops out there.	Criminals are more dangerous than police officers.
14664063	To put things in perspective perhaps the next NYT article/opinion could include some known statistics. There are on the order of 10 million police arrests per year, which means probably 4 times that in police interactions with the public. Of those arrests about 40% are black suspects so on the order of 4 million arrests of black folk/year. All of those arrests are adversarial, not many want to be arrested, and some percentage results in force. Now we have exactly one incident that resulted in an unjustified death. One out of 4 million puts things in a different perspective.	People are often aggressive when arrested, one instance out of 4 million does not mean police are using too much force.
14687281	I am not a statistician, but from what I see on media, there is a relation between race and shootings. It's only the black victims that get the media attention, and it only happens to men, never women, who get into a fight with the cops. There should be a community education program to teach the young black men how to behave when a cop stops them. The black priests should educate their congregation good manners better before accusing others of racism.	Only black victims get media attention, and it happens to men because they fight the cops.
14662370	The truth can be be seen by those with the will and courage to look. Although racism and prejudice is a complex social cultural learned mindset and practice it is also a practice used by the dominant group in power to maintain power. Witness slavery Jim Crow 5000 lynchings Stand your Ground and now white cops using laws to search arrest and kill black men to send a message that they don't want blacks latins or any minority to rise up and be equal. Whites are losing dominace and this is a rising period of backlash and control. The personal is political. Yes this was a personal murder. But if we care to look it was a white cop saying to himself this black man was not going to have his way in this world I can kill him and terrorize blacks.	Police officers are often influenced by racism in their use of force. Police is too willing to use force because white cops now use laws as an excuse to arrest and murder black men to ensure that minorities feel they aren't equal. Cops think they can have their way and terrorize people.
14680951	The feds found that the police and the courts in Missouri had a cultural bias that burdened people of color with police harassment and court fines, (as they exonerated the officer who shot Michael Brown). Perhaps the black lives matter will lead to a new civil rights movement that finally removes the cultural burden of our slavery and Jim Crow past.	Feds found that police and courts in Missouri had a cultural bias toward people of color.
14668570	New police officer applicants should be subjected to thorough psychological testing. Evidence of racist feelings should automatically disqualify them from the job. Current officers should be tested as well. No matter how many show racist attitudes they should be fired immediately. This has gone on way too long.	Psychological testing will reduce police violence. Screening police for racist individuals should reduce the willingness of officers to use force indiscriminately.
14666389	Police operate under stress. True. However, what is becoming more apparent is that officers for whatever reason are increasingly just too afraid of their job to be trusted with firearms. Rather than engaging a suspect with less than lethal force and running some risk of injury, police officers are becoming ever more reliant on deadly force to eliminate the risk. People are being shot in circumstances in which a cop of a generation ago never would have unholstered his weapon. Police are perpetually saying they feared for their life in circumstances where no such risk was apparent. In effect, they resort to killing people because they are not tough enough to handle the situation with less violence. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen	Stress can cause police to use deadly force when other tactics would work. Officers are being afraid of their jobs and cannot be trusted with firearms. Police are using deadly force to avoid being injured themselves. Police use the excuse of fear for life to abuse use of force. Police end up killing people because they are not tough enough to handle the situation.
14665475	"In our training we show videos too - dozens and dozens of video depicting officers being murdered during routine encounters with "nonviolent" and "unarmed" subjects." At one time in our history, more often and most likely a random citizen was unarmed. But today, given encouragement of the NRA, you have to assume everyone is armed and not necessarily trained to exercise restraint.	Police are shown videos of officers injured by people supposedly unarmed or non-violent. Because of the prevalence of weapons today, police need to assume everyone is armed.
14663042	Well, I looked up the statistics on policemen being shot. Turns out that were about 100 in the year 2013. That's among more than 1.1 million full time and 40,000 part time officers. I'm not so sure this trainer should be showing trainees so many videos of shootings. Traffic and other accidents might be just as lethal. Over preparation and paranoia cannot be helpful.	Fear and over training can hurt the situation.
11163128	I agree it will be a useful tool, to deport them. First identify all the people who have ignored the immigration laws of the US and then quietly deport them so they can be reunited with their families back in their country of origin.	ID cards will be helpful in deportations. The US should use immigrant ID cards to help deport illegals to their country of origin.
11161416	Mr. Camarota seems to be making the argument that locally issued ID's are not 'perfect', so we shouldn't issue them. All forms of ID will have some error rate, but that doesn't stop us from issuing passports & driving licenses. The benefits for policing, banking, etc. are well documented and exceed the cost of tolerating an error rate in the ID cards.	Immigrant ID cards provide benefits to policing and banking which outweigh the negative of fraud.
11179191	Of course all residents, regardless of background, are human beings and need to be treated like human beings. Identity cards help do that. But what would really do the most to uphold the humanity of everyone is to uphold the rule of law. You shouldn't be able to get a job without correct authorization to work. The reason is simple: unauthorized workers impact the labor market and drive down wages, especially for low skilled workers. Employers who hire unauthorized workers need to be punished so severely that they never do it again. Punishment for hiring unauthorized workers needs to be so frequent that behavior changes. Our millions of human beings living here who are unauthorized to work will either 1) become authorized or 2) return home to a place where they can improve their lives through work.	ID cards help all people to be treated like equal humans. Millions of people will get authorized to work or will return home to improve their lives with work.
11163651	Who is the mayor of N.Y. to assume he has the authority to dole out to illegal immigrants an almost carte blanche sure fire way to be on our sovereign soil, and all they had to do was break our laws by crossing our borders by getting here. If there ever was a way to encourage more of the same acts of disobedience for others to follow this surely would be it. If I was a border patrol agent sworn to serve and protect the citizens of these United States I would consider New York's mayor an enemy to their very cause, and an enemy to all those citizens who are here legally.	The mayor of New York doesn't have the authority. After crossing our border unlawfully they do not deserve an ID card as this is approval of being in our country. Immigrant ID cards would result in acts of disobedience.
11163402	Actually, it's a great idea, especially for law enforcement. Given that most illegal or undocumented people exists as electronic phantoms, with fake names or numbers, having a real set of ID, even if foreign derived, can be the loose thread needed to provide police with details on just who someone is. Police can then apply to the home country of a suspect to check for wants and warrants; if anything, it no longer allows the undocumented to hide in the shadow of anonymity as the government will now have access to a name, face, and fingerprint. It's an excellent idea.	Most undocumented people exist with fake names and numbers. Legal identification would help police identify people. Giving all immigrants ID cards would allow police to get information about people from their home country. Undocumented people would no longer remain anonymous to the government.
11160924	I am so confused by this issue I can hardly articulate an argument. If they're here illegally, what purpose will ID serve? If they're here illegally, how can they open bank accounts? If they're here illegally, why are we making it EASIER for them to live here? why don't we just grant them asylum, and give them citizenship already?	The ID would serve no purpose if they were here illegally. How can they open a bank account if they aren't here legally?. Illegal immigrants should be incorporated into society and given citizenship.
11160920	All residents - whether legal or illegal - should get free ID cards issued by every town in the nation. And those cards which indicate US citizenship can solve all voter ID and voter suppression issues nationwide. In one fell swoop, the nation can give both dignity to immigrants and dignity to our voting democracy. Where our right-wing Know Nothing-Do Nothing Congress fails spectacularly, local cities and towns can wildly succeed by filling the void of Congressional sedition and incompetence.	All towns should give all residents, citizens or not, free ID cards. Immigrant ID cards would solve all voting suppression issues. It would give dignity to both immigrants and democracy.
5373584	Part of the problem is the way this whole thing has been planned out. The state of California owns, and Amtrak operates, the Capitol Corridor between San Jose and Sacramento. Why couldn't the money be spent upgrading that line, building exclusive grade-separated and electrified tracks for HSR? That way, there would be true high-speed service on one of the busiest passenger rail corridors in the country and also a demonstrator line that could put to rest a lot of the disinformation spread by right-wing think tanks funded by the oil industry.	Money should be used to upgrade the line for HSR. High speed rail in California would be a boost to a busy rail corridor and show the rest of the US how to implement their own.
5395087	With population 36 million and growing, cost of oil, deadly & noxious air pollution, traffic congestion and all the rest, California would be fare better off with high speed Rail provided it is all build at ground level and not underground .	High speed rail would be helpful to the environment and citizens as long as it is built above ground.
5382541	Airports and the roads on east nor west coast can not handle the present volume adequately as is. I did ride the vast trains in Europe, Japan and China and found them very comfortable and providing much better connections and more efficient.	Current infrastructure is ineffective. The vast trains in Europe, Japan and China are comfortable. A rail provides connections and efficiency.
5378052	The narrow libertarian types never stop to think what it costs to NOT have intercity passenger rail. And one of the costs is airport delays, and the cost of adding another runway, etc. And rail is safer per mile traveled - much safer.	Not having an intercity passenger rail system could be more costly than constructing one. The rail is much safer.
5378257	With regard to the assertion that larger airplanes carrying more people will accommodate higher passenger volumes as opposed to more flights (and runways) for conventional aircraft (737s, etc.), not so. An Airbus 380 or Boeing 787 cannot be economically operated between San Francisco and LA at prices and costs competitive with smaller passenger planes. Hence, without relieving SF-LA air traffic with high speed rail, our airspace will not be able to handle the traffic. Already a quarter of intra-state flights are late due to air congestion.	An Airbus 380 or Boeing 787 cannot be economically operated between San Francisco and LA, at prices and costs competitive. California doesn't have enough air space.
5374214	WHY CAN WE NOT JUST EXPAND STANDARD & LIGHT RAIL? That's what I don't get about this high-speed rail proposal, it's obsession with a few big cities while the rest of the system languishes like it's been for decades. I'm perfectly fine with existing speeds, but there are far too many gaps in the existing system for convenience. Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus. If they want some faster routes, why not lay on some EXPRESS trains which do not stop at the smaller cities in between? Lastly the biggest problem in public acceptance is the sorry state of many stations. Nobody wants to wait in a station in a larger city or use it's bathrooms.	The existing system is fast enough, but has too many gaps. There are many places that require taking both bus and train. No one wants to wait in stations in larger cities.
5374084	If we calculate how much money went to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, I think that this project is pocket change. While Europe and Asia built their infrastructure the US invested in arms and wars. While other enjoy the benefits of fast and clean transportation, we are still debating if we should go forward or stay in the stone age for a little bit longer. Oh the irony...	Others enjoy the fast and clean benefits.
5373079	I'm as big of an environmentalist as they come and support massive investments in public transportation projects. But I'm worried that the resources going into this project arent wise. I think I'd rather see that same amount of money spent on vastly improving local public transit projects around CA. Specifically, money should be spent to: - improve and expand CalTrain and BART service in the Bay Area. - develop bus rapid transit in the Bay Area, Sacto, LA and San Diego - improve and expand LA's commuter train service Local transit projects like these could probably take more cars off the road, and provide just as many construction jobs, as the high speed train.	As an environmentalist, I support investments in public transportation. There are too many resources being used for the project. Public transit projects around California should be improved, because local transit projects could reduce traffic and provide as many jobs as the high-speed rail.
5377578	While I would not mind being able to take a High Speed Train to Los Angeles, I just don't see how there will ever be enough passengers to make the project feasible as an ongoing economic venture. If someone has the numbers to illustrate where all the daily passengers are going to come from - please let me know.	I don't think there will be enough passengers to make a high-speed rail economic.
5374692	I live in Fresno, visit family in San Franscisco , San Diego, and LA. I have a second home near San Bernadino and business in Oakland. Car trips are expensive, tedious and dangerous. Staying awake, the Grapevine with snow, the crazies racing each other, the traffic jams.. The Amtrack to San Diego takes eleven hours by train then bus. Time to join the 21st century please.	A high-speed rail would make travel more economical, comfortable, and safe. California needs high-speed rail because there are many impediments to save car travel such as traffic jams and Amtrack is not fast enough.
5371635	The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San José is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service "doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas." Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life. Perhaps get some opinions from UC Irvine?	The local transit and intercity rail should work together. More people will use high speed rail to get to LAX. Changing intercity travel could change local travel preferences.
5374180	High speed rail (or airplanes, for 500 mile hops) don't save much time vs. driving when considering the need to arrive at the station/airport early, and the issue of getting to where you are going once you get off the train. I think a far more useful service would be more AutoTrain routes, to accommodate those not starting or ending their actual trips in a central city.. Something like Chicago -Cincinnati-Charlotte-Atlanta-Orlando would be a good start.	Additional travel time makes a high speed rail impractical.
3590149	As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one.	Camera phones and the internet have become intrusions upon the privacy of celebrities.
3587005	It is much easier today to be a celebrity. Today, as amazing as it seems in our world, people find celebrities like Charlie Sheen and his antics, orgies, rants, etc. entertaining. He is probably more popular now than before. Years ago, if behavior like that had become public, his fans would have shunned him, and his career would probably be over. My parents told me it took a long time for Elizabeth Taylor's fans to forgive her for being the other woman and stealing Eddie Fisher away from America's sweetheart, Debbie Reynolds. In Hollywood now, this is acceptable behavior. We've even come to expect it, as we have talk shows and books detailing all their affairs.	Celebrities get more popularity now than before, and it is easier to become a celebrity. Behavior that was once unacceptable for celebrities is now tolerated and expected.
2341049	The only kind of dream manipulation we should do is if we are actually in a dream and able to control where it goes. The Senoi Indians believe that our dream state is really the other side of our wakeful state and that the two are equal in importance. I have learned so much from my dreams. They are sometimes frightening, but I see even these as some sort of cathartic experience that I am learning from, albeit perhaps on an unconscious level at times. Dreams can actually help keep us sane. They are a means to process what we may not want or know how to process in our wakeful state. That is why the Senoi made it a practice to discuss their dreams every morning. Sort of like a "Tell me about your night."	Senoi Indians believe that our dream state is the other side of our wakeful state, and is of equal importance. My dreams have taught me much. Dreams help us process thins we may have missed or ignored in our waking state.
2340152	As one who has not a single dream in 70 years of life despite many therapists asserting that I certainly had dreams and just stubbornly redefined them as something else; I would welcome the idea of scripting dreams! Having attempted directed dreaming, directed meditation, countless visualization methods, and the like; I'll accept the notion of dreaming, but without the personal experience I must concede that I am like the blind man wondering on the nature of a sunrise! So all you script writers; please script away!!	I like the idea of scripting dreams, but I don't have personal experience.
2340838	I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too.	Controlling nightmares leads to being better rested. When controlling the outcome of nightmares, people tend to be more control in life.
2338618	I am with Sandra from WA all the way. I have a rich and fulfilling dream life, which flash across my subconscious screens every night. I dream in bright, resonant colors, see amazing shapes and faces. I meet people I would never meet in real life: scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, writers. These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing. However, no matter what the content, I always look forward to my nightly ride into my subconscious life. It's always an adventure and it makes my waking life much more interesting and full.	Looking into my dreams gives me a look into my subconscious life and it is always an adventure.
14384573	Goofy beyond belief. Religious beliefs are just that...beliefs. To whatever degree a religious practice is benign, it should be allowed. When the practice impinges upon public health or safety, it must be curtailed for the benefit of the entire society. Our tradition is not to concern ourselves with how people worship their god (or choose not to worship at all.) All are free to practice their religion as they see fit. Accordingly, we should also be able to choose to be free of religion when it impinges upon public health or well being. Permitting religious beliefs to trump science is antithetical to our secular culture.	Relgious beliefs are beliefs, not fact, and parents should not base medical decisions on them. When freedom hurts society, it should be curtailed for society's sake. We do not dictate how people should worship. Our culture is secular so religious beliefs should not be able to trump science.
14384571	If a parent refuses to immunize the children, they should be forced to buy additional health and liablity coverages, so that if they can reimburse the cost of treatment, after effects of disceases and the expense to the government and people, in case. This way noo ne is forced to abandon their beliefs. They can make their choice.	If people chose to not immunize, they should pay more for insurance to cover the extra risk associated without immunizations and the risk they pose to society as a whole. People should be allowed to adhere to their religious beliefs.
14388117	When I am confronted by religious practitioners passionately arguing for absolute religious freedom I have lately started to pose questions of them rather than argue. For example, how should we deal with a religious group that practices cannibalism? Among those societies that have practiced it, there has been a sacred and even reverential set of beliefs built around sharing in the admirable qualities of the person whose flesh is shared. Supposedly wine becomes blood and bread becomes flesh during Communion. I am met with incredulous stares when I mention this. It could never happen, I am told. When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them. These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them. We know intuitively what we as a society are willing to accept and harming children is not among them. What we do to ourselves as adults is one thing. Losing a child unnecessarily harms us all.	We would not allow cannibalism to occur even though it is  a strong religious belief. There should be limits to religious freedom regarding health. Children should have inherent rights to receive medical care.
14386183	Anyone who agrees that "Religious beliefs and objections do not and should not supply an absolute license to violate general laws" should object to the statutory exemptions now in place (many described by Rita Swan in the next article). These statutory exemptions supply an "absolute license" and endanger many children.	Anyone who thinks that your religious beliefs don't give you the right to break the law should disagree with the current exemptions. Children are endangered when exempted from medical care.
14378665	The Christian Scientist's argument I'm sure seems cogent to her and as an adult she is free to make decisions that based on all known scientific and medical evidence are dangerous. But what religion or coherent ethical or moral code allows a parent to (in extreme cases) essentially allow their child to die when it is preventable. Give the child the right to grow up and form his or her own opinions.	No ethical religion should be allowed to refuse medical care for children. The child should grow and form his or her own opinions.
14384443	Reasonable public health measures must not be subjected to religious exemption. The measles problem in California is the direct result of permitting parents to opt out of vaccinations for religious reasons or because of reliance on long-disproved flawed medical studies. A parent should not have the right to insist that their child be permitted to be a potential carrier of a dangerous communicable disease. The other tragedies discussed here--a consequence of effective lobbying by the Christian Science Church--should be within the power of the states to prevent.	Public health should not be subjected to religious views. A direct result of permitting parents to opt out for religious reasons or etc., is the measles problem in California. A parent's rights do not include making their children carriers of dangerous communicable diseases.
14386008	As someone who was permanently disabled due to a Christian Science upbringing, I wholeheartedly support this call to eliminate religious loopholes in child protection laws. Children deserve equal protection, regardless of what church their parents attend. Quite honestly, I don't see why this concept is so difficult for legislators to grasp. We already forbid some child neglect and abuse--why not forbid all of it?	I was permanently disabled due to a Christian Science upbringing and I support eliminating religious loopholes in child protection laws. Children have the fundamental right to receive medical treatment. We have laws against abuse and child neglect.
14382821	It's heartbreaking to think of children suffering because of denial of treatment - or protection against disease - from a religion they did not choose. We respect religious belief, but that respect should not extend to medical neglect of children any more than it extends to child sacrifice. There are limits on parental rights and religious freedom, and they should come into play when children are put at risk.	It is sad to think that children may be forced to suffer through illness or worse because a religion that was forced upon them drove their parents to that decision. We shouldn't allow parents to put their childrens health at risk because of religious freedoms.
14379665	Its not about religion, its about self-destructive behavior and child abuse. We 'believe' that more available birth control and education are at odds with mainstream religion; when actually most of the devote are not fanatics. America is afraid to place restriction on the poor, mentally retarded, mentally ill, felons, or even youth to prevent them from having children or owning guns. To do so places a society at risk of sterilizing the innocent, or worse. I've watched so many members of my family seek religious solutions to medical issues because the medical answers aren't there. They become recluses in homeless shelters. They suffer and their children suffer. Society somehow imagines the answer is making them 'unborn' because real solutions are complex, expensive and require new technologies that aren't here yet. For me the question is, "How do we help people who are suffering, so they make better choices?" Good faith, means trusting others to behave altruistically; unless they don't. When they are hurting others the issue is no longer about their rights. Children are not the possession of a cult, community or individual. Collectively society must intervene and intervene with extreme care.	Refusing medical care for your children is child abuse. Society should intervene when parents are hurting their children and by extension others in spite of their rights.
14376802	It is upsetting to know that children suffer -- and even die -- because of parents' religious beliefs. In the case of vaccinations, other children, as well as adults, are put at risk. I wish we could outlaw religion. That may sound unreasonable -- but allowing a child to suffer and die is even more unreasonable.	Parent's religious beliefs should not cause children to suffer or die. Unvaccinated children are public health risk to all.
14385635	It would be helpful if Christian Scientists, in defending their faith practice, also noted that there are a number of "fail-safe" provisions in their church teaching covering vaccination, surgery, pain relief, and an overall category of the "right use of temporal means." Not only are Christian Scientists not forbidden from going to doctors, they are instructed to choose a quality physician if need be and confer with physicians if they have no idea what they are praying about. The dogma of "no medicine ever" is just that, and has done inestimable damage to their desire to promote spiritual healing. It's not surprising that most people think of Christian Science as empty or dangerous superstition given the anecdotal nature of most church testimonies of healing and the tragedies that have occurred when parents and others have refused medical attention in dire circumstances because they believed their teachings prevented them from going to doctors.	Dogma of "no medicine ever", has done inestimable damage to promote spiritual healing.
14385444	As an adult without children, the writer is entitled to believe whatever she wants as long as she doesn't endanger others. But this is just the kind of thinking -- with or without God -- expressed by parents of unvaccinated children, who put their entire neighborhood and beyond at risk because they _believe_ they are doing the right thing. There was just news, for example, that the measles outbreak has now spread into Canada tied to the first transmission in Disneyland. There should be no exemptions in the public sphere for parents who believe in magical thinking, no matter what their alleged divine source. And if we learn of a child at risk of serious injury or death because his/her parents _believe_ they are doing the right thing, I hope the state will step in like it would any other form of child abuse. There should be no exemption for carelessness or stupidity.	Making vaccine decisions based on religion puts community in danger. Parent's not immunizing due to beliefs has caused the measles to spread to Canada. There should not be exemptions for parents who believe in magical thinking. No one should be excused for absolute ignorance.
14383609	If medicine were still at the level of the 19th century when Mary Baker Eddy came up with her concept I would say faith based healing would rank well with say, blood letting, mustard plasters or the wonders of goose grease and turpentine. Good Lord, antiseptic practices like hand washing between patients weren't even widely accepted by the Doctors of the day. You probably were better off praying that the doctor wouldn't find you if you got sick!	Allowing religious beliefs to dictate medicine would only be acceptable if modern medicine were ineffective.
14383502	As an Episcopal priest raised in a family with a dad who was a Christian Scientist. I look at this through a slightly different lens. I ran as fast as I could from Christian Science and then upon joining the Episcopal Church found myself involved in a healing ministry. The difference being that we supplemented traditional medical treatment with prayer. I've seen some miraculous healings so yes I believe it assists healing but does not replace medicine. That said, I firmly believe in the right on an adult to choose what they wish to believe and do, but a child should be protected by the state. I'm grateful my mom insisted that I have surgery at age 5.	Miraculous healing doesn't replace medicine. Adults can make their own health choices but children should be protected by the state.
14382686	I wonder how Ms Howell and others who insist it's their right to deny medical care to their children because they "are committed to following in Christ Jesus' steps of relying on God's power alone for healing" feel about others with different religious beliefs which dictate that they give their daughters in "marriage" to pedophile cult leaders, or who insist that their god requires that all girls be genitally mutilated according to the dictates of their belief system? We actually prosecute people who do such things. Why should a person who risks a child's life under the guise of a "Christian" belief be exempt? While enlightened people have existed for milennia, the Age of Reason officially began in the 18th century. When will we enter the 21st century?	We prosecute people who allow other religious beliefs to dictate harmful behaviors, so it is not right for Christians to be able to do so. A person who risks the life of a child is performing a criminal act.
14382500	The author's comment is a non-sequitur. Her dubious accounts of supernatural intervention do not provide an argument that parents have a right to deny their children medical care on any legal or ethical grounds. If parents adopted Christian Science principles there would be widespread disease and death.	Parents do not legally or ethically have the right to deny their children medical care on the basis of supernatural intervention. Refusing medical care will lead to widespread disease and death.
14379270	Ms. Slaton Howell perfectly articulates exactly why no religious excemptions should ever be allowed, especially those that fly in the face of child welfare and the common good. It surprises me that so thin an argument could actually be published in the NYTimes.	Religious exemptions for child access to healthcare could harm the child.
16146321	Russia having a common interest in cooperating on terror seems like a valid point. But a minor one, when compared with Russia's larger geopolitical objectives. I believe Russia's hidden motive in Syria, is to use the immigration crisis as a weapon to attack the west. Russia is using the west's own sense of compassion and valuation of human rights, as a weapon against us. By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere. I have long felt that Assad, and his father before him, were the only true impediment to peace in the middle east. Get rid of Assad, and I believe all the other pieces will fall into place.	Cooperating with Russia on terrorism ignores Russia's overall objectives. Russia is not cooperating smoothly leaving confusing issues which side they belong. Russia is able to use the compassion and human rights as a weapon. Russia is using Syria to create crisis and distract from Russian expansion.
16146730	why listen to a discredited ambassador of failed US policy? the same hardline time after time, the Ammy version of diplomatic satyriasis. partnering Russia in Syria will not only scare Isis, it will defeat them, and...mend our fences with Russia, who is a natural ally for us. we need their help and they need ours- can't we ever be a good neighbor to the world? going back to the Cold War is like repouring concrete.	Working with Russia in Syria will defeat ISIS and begin mending fences with Russia who would be a good ally. Currently, they could help us as much as we help them, it is important to be a good and helpful member of the world.
16145208	The Sunni uprising we started in Iraq spread to Syria. For all intents and purposes, these two countries no longer exist. We hold on to an outpost in Baghdad. The Russians want to secure their outpost in Damascus. The millions caught in the middle are fleeing to Europe and threatening the notion of a European Union. This the reality on the ground. The time for bluster and threats is over. Total chaos reins. If America, Russia and Iran can come together on a plan to ratchet down the madness, regardless of what unsavory characters stay in power, it will be a start.	If Russia works together with Iran and America it will help control Syria.
8360040	1. Managers should be required to disclose weaknesses to shareholders in all companies, and potential shareholders in publicly traded companies, 2. Companies that do business with the Federal government, especially those with defense contracts, should be required to disclose hacking attempts as a matter of national security. 3. Companies who maintain databases of customers that include personal and financial information, including credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other such data, should be required to disclose hacking attacks to their customers. Now there may be some companies out there who don't fall under one of those three categories, but I think that pretty much covers the waterfront.	Shareholders should be advised of any weaknesses on publicly traded companies. Companies should disclose hacking attempts as a matter of national security. Companies that keep sensitive information about their customers, should disclose hacks to those customers.
8370267	Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess. Until that happens companies won't do anything about real security for consumers' information.	Companies will have to take on more responsibility in protecting themselves because then they will be liable. What you don't know can hurt you, badly. Corporations should cover the losses of identity theft of their customer if they are hacked and should be required to inform customer right away.
11528041	Voice recognition is not where it needs to be at all, especially when trying to capture back and forth across a big room. Don't have a problem with an audio record also, but have to have text. I know this is not how we are 'supposed' to think about technology, but do we want to end thousands of good paying jobs? I don't, especially when there is value over technologies that aren't good enough.	Voice recognition doesn't work well across a large room. We should not want technology to replace thousands of good paying jobs.
11520908	I'm an attorney and frequently appear in Family Court. The court has substituted audio recording for live reporters in most proceedings. The resultant recordings are then transcribed manually by someone listening to the audio record if transcript is ordered. The transcripts that are typed from the audio recording of the proceeding are invariably terrible. Parts of the transcript are virtually always missed and marked as 'inaudible.' Other parts are garbled. The transcripts are frequently worse than nothing at all. There is no real substitute for a transcript produced by a competent reporter and not having a reporter may sacrifice justice for the sake of saving a few dollars.	Somebody still needs to transcribe audio recordings. Transcripts of audio from court proceedings are not good. Even though parts of transcriptions may be missing or garbled they are better than nothing at all. A transcript produced by a competent reporter is irreplaceable, and not having one may sacrifice justice.
11523833	With all due respect, Judge Kopf, digital recording technology cannot capture when somebody is not speaking loud enough, clear enough, or speaks with a thick accent. A court reporter is able to interrupt and clarify for an accurate record. And there is no technology that can replace a real time reporter, who can provide an instantaneous translation, which results in immediate resolution of an issue that might otherwise delay a proceeding and enables judges to speed up their dockets, and lawyers to move on to their next case, which will speed up the judicial system as a whole, therefore saving money, if that indeed is your ultimate goal.	We need court stenographers because recording technology does not work well at low levels or with difficult accents. They keep good records. Court stenographers are necessary for the efficient process of the judicial system.
11525742	Having access to videos of depositions that are also stenographically transcribed, I have seen firsthand that the human error rate is high. But why wouldn't it be? There are not many of us who have the concentration level to type precisely what people say for hours and hours at a time. Recordings are accurate, but the problem is that in order to cite them in a brief, they must be stenographically transcribed.	Recordings aren't able to be cited in a brief, a stenographers transcription is needed.
11526420	This is simply wrong. IBM's Jeopardy playing computer Watson, and Apples artificial assistant don't just 'record sounds'. They filter, interpret, and assign meaning to the sounds they hear. This same technology will inevitably be put into a 'court recorder' app.	Stenographers' work can be put into an app.
2879291	Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--"get big or get out"--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture.	Current farm subsides are not the same ones from FDR's, they were changed during the Nixon administration by Earl Butz. Modern industrial agriculture in the US is not designed to survive without Farm Subsidies. US farm subsidies promote agricultural monoculture, I would like to see subsidies eliminated.
2876711	My maternal Georgia grandfather farmed during the Roosevelt administration. He opposed President Roosevelt because he believed correctly that Roosevelt's policies undermined his effort to operate his farm with a profit. My grandfather was a wise man who understood more than he might have been able to voice effectively. My maternal Georgia grandfather farmed during the Roosevelt administration. He opposed President Roosevelt because he believed correctly that Roosevelt's policies undermined his effort to operate his farm. My grandfather was a wise man who understood more than he might have been able to voice effectively how subsidies undermined farming. I wish he could read Professor Folsom's appraisal. Thank you, I want to read your book.	President Roosevelt's farm subsidy program undermines efforts to operate a farm with a profit. My wise grandfather believed correctly that subsidies undermine farming.
2878785	Let me begin by saying that I grew up in farm country (cash grain - corn/soybeans) and I own farm land and annually receive farm subsidy payments. I would make a few points. First, most of the people who expound about farmers and farming have no idea what they are talking about. Second, I have heard about giant farms who receive huge subsidies all my life, so I presume it must be true, but it simply doesn't exist in the corn/soybean area I am familiar with. Third, there have been dramatic boom/bust cycles in crop prices the past few years, but this has been driven by speculators in the commodities markets, and currency manipulation (China). Fourth, farm products such as corn and soybeans are one of the few items that this country still exports in large amounts, so you had better be careful what you do. Finally, having said that, there has not been a recession in farm country - the farmers are doing quite nicely, and there is no reason that crop payments for corn and soybeans should continue.	Farmers are holding their own and that has been proven because there hasn't been a financial recession for farmers.
2908114	As the son of a farmer, I reluctantly agree with the author's conclusion. Farm subsidies grossly reward a small-percentage of large-scale corporate farms and businesses, which now operate on scales in vast disproportion to the revered Jeffersonian single-farmer business. Farm subsidies indirectly support major pharmaceutical companies through chemicals, oil industries (fertilizer), and diesel production/ports; a very nationalist enterprise in an era of which America is the self-proclaimed champion of global free markets and force tariff removals. There are only two kinds of farmers: those selling their land and millionaires...there is little in-between in this industry...which also can no longer survive in a free market...commcercial farming has, in the words of a famous person, become 'too big too be allowed to fail.'	Farm Subsidies reward corporate farms not single farmer businesses. Farm subsides are a nationalist enterprise when we say we champion the global free market.
2880029	The farm subsidies actually hurt the type of farm that has traditionally been the backbone of America. I refer to the small to medium size family farm. Smaller farms can detail their crops and rotations to better conserve soil and water. They support a traditional farmer life style. Small farms support small towns, local banks, grocery stores, schools, equipment dealers and a wide farmer's work ethic. Larger farms destroy all of this. If we support farms in order to help America, let's support small farms that actually help it.	Farm subsidies hurt the traditionally run farms.
2877431	First, the result of farm subsidies is cheaper food, not rich farmers. Second, farm subsidies should be reduced to help reduce the deficit, but that reduction should be proportional. Elimination of farm subsidies would dramatically affect our balance of trade, as farm exports currently help balance imports of manufactured goods.	Farm subsides create cheaper food, not rich farmers. Farm subsidy reduction would reduce the deficit. If we eliminate farm subsides it would affect our trade balance as it helps balance our import of manufactured goods.
2876850	Farm subsidies, along with many others, should have been cut off years ago. Farming is now a big business with many farms being large scale industrial enterprises and many farmers are now millionaires. Better to impose tariffs on foreign imports than continue to feed hogs with out tax dollars. As Harry Truman said, " If you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen."	It would be better to impose tariffs on foreign imports than to use tax dollars to support farmers, since many farms are large scale industrial enterprises and many farmers are millionaires.
17280005	This commentary is in support of equal outcomes - not equal access. And it favors Latinos over other groups. Qualified students of any culture, race, and religion should have an opportunity to go to college, but free is not the answer.	Higher education should focus on equivalent outcomes instead of attempting to provide access to all. All students should have the opportunity to attend college, but not for free.
17278571	Yep, I got to go to CUNY free, and it was a struggle to buy books, got a BA and a Master's there went on to work for colleges for 34 years and retired comfortably. Without free college, my life would have been very different, and I would have been a net loss to society, rather than what I hope has been a net gain. Good investment, NYC let's get back to that nationwide. "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men." -Fredrick Douglass	It is hard to buy books. I would have had a very different life without free college I would have been a loss to society instead of a gain. It is better to educate children than the remedy uneducated men.
17295969	I am glad to support the free community college, because there are tons of people out there who would like to go to college and aren't able to because of the price. Everyone who is qualified for the community college they want to go to, should be able to go for 2 years with no free, including fees and books. If they are welling to go to college and work for there agree then they should have some help on the pay for college.	I would be happy to support free community college so those who can't afford it can get educated. Every qualified student should be able to complete 2 years of community college. Students should have some help to pay.
17285062	Herein lies the rub ..."Many require remedial courses to catch up to college-level work." What are we doing wrong in K-12 to prepare students for the rigors of college? Heck, my daughter has well above a 4.0 and has scored high on PSAT, etc and I still worry about the rigors of college. We need to set up all students for success. If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the "all boats rise" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine. I feel differently about it when taxpayers are funding it.	The cost of a college education is very high and not all students are prepared to meet tough academic standards. The need to teach remedial subjects to students at college level indicates they are not ready for college. Access to higher education is crucial and it should be heavily subsidized. There are other ways to do this.
17286558	I'm neither a dogmatic liberal nor a pandering politician (I'm an unabashed leftist). Education is the most important investment the people can make with their tax dollars. It's a legitimate, working get-rich-quick scheme. Look at the post-WWII GI Bill as a model. Education in public institutions of higher learning should be absolutely free of cost for qualified students. The taxpayers who pay for it will be among the first to benefit.	Education is very important and should be funded with tax money. It's a legal scheme for them to get rich quick for colleges. The WWII GI Bill is an example. Qualified students should receive a free education. Taxapayers will be the first to benefit.
17283752	*There are many college graduates working at low-paying jobs for which their education is unrelated, and can't pay off their student loans. If a university contends that the content of what it teaches will enhance the earning power of the graduate sufficiently to pay off that cost, then let that university self-finance the student debt. Otherwise, accept that what is being taught has a cost that is not commensurate to improved ability to pay it. Get the government and the taxpayer out of it.	College graduates cannot pay off their tuition loans with low paying jobs. The university should self-finance the student debt.
17281358	where we need to make the improvement is high school. Universities and colleges and community colleges are not supposed to waste valuable time and money teaching remedial skills that should be taught in high school. This is where resources should be concentrated. In addition, from a socially equitable perspective, this will have the most impact. Just sending everyone up to college will lead to a disaster for many students, unable to hack it, and taxpayers.	Higher level education should not teach remedial skills, which should be taught in high school. If everyone goes to college for free, it will be disastrous because some students won't be able to make it and taxpayers will foot the bill.
17374751	Indeed, one cannot actually buy a college education like one can buy a house or a private airplane but the basic presumption of Kelly is that it is exactly the same. Anyone can who pays the money will have the knowledge and skills injected into their minds, and thus benefit. So why should some be handed it while others pay for it? One must perform considerable work over a prolonged period of time and not everyone has the ability to do it in a reasonable time nor to be able to use it well. But the reason society creates and maintains colleges and universities is that they enable all to benefit from the knowledge and skills those able and willing to gain them do for themselves and everybody else. It's worth making it affordable to all who can manage to do the work because it greatly improves that kind of potential that our workforce can provide and be prepared for all opportunities that might arise.	You can buy a car like you can a house or an airplane. Everyone will benefit. The cost of college is high and should be paid by the individual students and not passed on to the taxpayers. Those who are willing to gain should do it for themselves.
17297586	I would enthusiastically support free 4 year college for everyone with a 3.0 High School GPA and scores of 1900 on the SAT or 28 on the ACT and free 2 year community college for everyone with a 2.5 GPA and scores of 1590 on the SAT or 23 on the ACT. If someone attends community college and achieves a 3.0 GPA there, they should be able to transfer to a 4 year college and have the remainder of that paid for them. If a kid can't achieve the levels for free tuition at a university or community college, they can still pay to attend. Maybe they'll prove everyone wrong. It's vitally important to the country that all our smart and studious kids who want it, can choose higher education, no matter their means. Whatever we would spend on tuition for the 3.0 GPA students, we would gain back many times over. There will be increased productivity, increased tax revenues, better general health, less crime, inventions, cures, who knows what we'll get? History tells us that it will be a big win-win. It's a worthwhile investment.	College should be free at the community college level. College should be free for those that are capable of performing at that level. If college was free we would gain a lot more than we spent in tuition for 3.0 GPA students. There are many benefits to college if it is free. College is important.
17294645	Higher education is an investment in human resources for the future progress and well-being of the nation and its citizens. Public funding of tuition costs, the pre-Reagan practice in California, is as valid as public funding for other investments in capital and human resources for the nation: roads, bridges, defense capability, regulation of corporations, medical research, health care for all, community fire and policing capability, protection of the environment, etc.... Better educated citizenry strengthens democracy and enables more effective investment in national resources. Nancy's spouse	College should be free because higher education is important for the future progress and health of citizens and their nation. Public funding for tuition is as valid as funding for any other kind of investment. Having educated citizens allows for better investment in resources and a stronger democracy.
17291462	If the student doesn't have something in the game there's no value. It will encourage undecided underachievers to mark time, or get their parents off their back. It can't be a right, you must achieve and properly conduct yourself in the college society. Bad grades, bad conduct, out! With those parameters I can't think of a better investment for the people of the United States.	College must be earned and attended by persons who conduct themselves properly. Free college would be a great investment for the people of the United States.
17285221	My great-uncle, Charles Woollen, was Comptroller of the University of North Carolina in the early 1900s. UNC was America's first public university, with free tuition for all NC residents, because NC wished to have an educated populace. Unfortunately, females and blacks were not admitted to UNC as were white males, though this has changed. And also unfortunately, UNC no longer offers free tuition, and tuition/fees have risen while admission has become much more difficult. I am a UNC graduate who also has been UNC faculty, and my father and daughters have been UNC graduates. Perhaps if UNC ceased paying top administrators and coaches outrageous salaries and perks, students could again earn degrees without having large debts to pay.	College ought to be free because UNC provides an example in its history as the first public university in the US and its commitment to educated NC residents who received free tuition. High salaries for coaches and administrators is driving up the cost of tuition.
17285017	"Second, free college plans assume that tuition prices are the main obstacle to student success, looking past problems of educational quality and college readiness." Exactly. It's high time that Americans stopped allowing their political leaders to shirk the difficult responsibilities of leadership by simply spending new money. Supporting education through increased spending is NOT necessarily supporting education. But it is, and always will be, way easier.	There are lots of reasons that students do not succeed in college besides the high costs, such as educational quality and student readiness. Americans need to stop allowing politicians to spend money instead of dealing with hard problems. More spending is NOT an effective way to support education.
17284633	"First, free college isn't free, it simply shifts costs from students to taxpayers and caps tuition at zero. That tuition cap limits college spending to whatever the public is willing to invest. But it does not change the cost of college, or what institutions actually spend per student." Yes it does... you can't spend more than you have, just a simple fact. Public education would likely be cheaper on a per student basis than the private version. Classes would be larger, dorms less nice, with less landscaping on the lawns. I don't think that's necessarily bad. I think the current system is actually the worst of all worlds - a loan and financial aid system that effectively allows colleges to charge each student the absolute maximum of what they're able to pay, with public subsidies helping increase the price further.	Public college would decrease the cost per student. The system in place which charges the highest price allowed and public subsidies increase the price further.
17284024	'Free' does not project value. Offering free state university tuition sounds great. Does it solve society problems? Not necessarily! I have seen many students with full federal tuition support due poorly. The distractions and challenges, outside the classroom, still distract them. Plus it is not their money. They did not have to earn or borrow it. There is a tendency for them to withdraw from a class. Free public education impacts the ability of non-profit private colleges to exist. What happens when these institutions crumble? Do state schools have the capacity to pick-up non-profit private school students? Can we afford 'free' across all college students? 'Free' excites us. If it sounds too good to be true . . .	College would not hold the value it does if it was free. College should not be free because some are not suited for college and I have seen this waste. Students tend to withdraw from classes. Free public education undermines private alternatives.
17282934	Making college free means that those who can and would afford to pay tuition will, instead, keep their money. The colleges will then have less money to use to help needy students, whose needs certainly extend beyond tuition. Making colleges free helps the rich and takes resources away from the poor. Why would such a regressive rule be thought to be helpful?	Free college would mainly benefit those who can already afford to pay. Free college will result in reduced funding for students that have needs that are not tuition based. If college were free it would take help from the poor and help the rich.
17282881	What another liberal fad. Tuition is too high for many reasons, chiefly because colleges and universities for the most part compete to be all things to all people, so faculty and classroom space must constantly expand. Also, only the wealthy pay the 'rack rate' full tuition at the top institutions with decent endowments or state funding. Free tuition would increase two things: more marginally or unqualified applicants and proliferation of easy, feel good, study yourself courses and majors. The idea of substituting community service for standardized test scores and grades as a basis for admission will further dilute the seriousness of university scholarship. I would offer free tuition if at all to majors in English, foreign languages, science, math, music, engineering -- not social science, cultural 'studies', film, and pre-professional majors such as business, accounting, marketing and so forth (nufsuch).	Free tuition would attract less qualified applicants and an increase in non-academic self-help classes.
17282699	It seems obvious to us that free, basic health care and education are the two social services that should be available to everybody. Free education is, from an macro economical stand point, a much better investment than the US model because it increases the productivity of the population at large. Free health care lowers the general cost to the GDP from 16% to 7%, the average in Europe. If this was applied, the US would free up 9% of its GDP or $1.5 trillion, each year, for disposal income.	It increases productivity for the majority of the population.
17282592	the bottom line is just that the bottom line, so long as we encourage the continued raping of this country citizenry then the more recent for profit colleges/financing will continue to hurt all. Ergo the need to return to non profit colleges and universities would fix the real issues here. Of course so long as we have republicans controlling most of this nations governments this will never happen. Whatever happened to the SEC, as a for instance. The lack of morals/ethics and community spirit has undermined all but the 1% or those wannabes. Truly disgusting and what's worse I don;t see how this ever really changes?	College is too expensive and should be made available to everyone. Making universities not-for-profit would solve the issue.
17282355	Coming from Canada, where tuition is subsidized to a greater extent than in the US, I can see the advantage to free education, but have also seen the disadvantages. It opens up opportunities for people that wouldn't be able to go otherwise, and gives a boost to the economy from new graduates not being saddled with huge student loans. Unfortunately, it also leads to people attending, who might not be ready and are doing it because it is free. And ties a schools hands if costs escalate more than government funding. A better way may be to reduce, but not eliminate tuition with have students loans that are partially forgiven upon successful completion of the program, and the remainder of the student loans be set at a manageable interest rate.	Free college would open up opportunities and boost the economy. People who may not be ready for college may attend because it's free. If costs grow more than government funding, the school's hands are tied.
17282189	The scarcity argument is so tiresome. We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!) Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps. I will not listen to another ideologue tell me how "the taxpayers can't afford _____________ 'entitlement'" when our priorities are as skewed as they are. The taxpayers--and all those private donors--can afford PLENTY; it's what they're willing to spend it on that's the problem. I can't take someone seriously who claims, essentially, that qualified students shouldn't have affordable or free tuition because of football.	We are the wealthiest country. Education is underfunded, even though there is plenty of money. Universities with elite athletic programs have an overabundance of cash provided by taxpayers and donors. Colleges are not spending their money wisely.
17281035	I graduated from Brooklyn College when it was free. The children of my friends in Europe attend the university for free, and also receive a stipend for books and living expenses. I don't understand how other nations can invest in the education of their youth, but we cannot. Aren't we supposed to be the greatest?	Europe has free college. Other countries invest in their youth's education, why can't we?.
17277601	"Barring a drastic improvement in efficiency, tuition-free colleges won't have the resources to serve additional students without compromising the quality of their offerings." Improvement in efficiency is key here. Certification provides jobs, and social improvement provides purpose. They are different, society benefits when people are working in a rapidly changing job culture. The individual benefits from better communication, cultural growth and personal recognition. Society has an obligation to pay for its own growth - certification for work. "Despite free tuition, just one-third of students from the bottom income quartile who started at a community college in 2003 finished a degree or certificate by 2009." What on earth is a bottom income quartile student? These are people who need doable steps. If this interferes with the ability to obtain a self-supporting job, society pays. Society pays and pays and pay when people can't care for themselves.	Free college would be a drain on current resources due to student influx decreasing quality. Society owes it to itself to make college free. Publicly funded education would cost society too much.
9047413	Mr. Perry makes a very reasonable argument, but I think there are very few Spud Webbs out there anymore. Most of the pros are probably a good 6 inches taller than they were even 20 or 25 years ago, let alone 100, so you would think raising the rim is a reasonable alternative. I do appreciate his concern about the amount of time to adjust to the change, but I suspect that really talented and conditioned atheletes will find a way to make it work pretty rapidly.	Raising the rim is a good idea because pros are taller than they were years ago. The good athletes will learn how to work with the raised rim pretty quickly.
9045292	Whatever height the NBA makes the basket will then be the height used in gyms and driveways across the world. Kids, females,and averaged sized males will be forced to shoot almost straight-up as if shooting inside a silo. The NBA is not in a vacuum. The rest of the world does not want to be shooting at a higher basket.	The NBA raising the rim will force other people to raise the rim as well. It would be an awkward shot for those who are average height and not in the NBA. Players in the rest of the world don't want a higher basket.
9049369	Keep the basket where it is but make a 1 point shot line close to the basket. A dunk requires no skill, it just requires the right genes. And for added fun make another line farther out than the 3 pointer, why not have a 4 point shot?	Leave it in it's currently place and make shots made close only 1 point. It only takes good genes to dunk a basketball.
9047310	The comments here are so odd ... not many fans of the game here. Dunks are difficult to achieve, especially with the defenses that are now common in the NBA. What LeBron does isn't 'easy' by any means. The standards of the game have risen since the 'good old days', and the dunk is one weapon (and not the primary weapon) in the overall arsenal of the NBA offense. Much of the lamenting here strikes me as bitter old people yearning for the past. The NBA is better today than it was 40 years ago.	Dunks are still difficult to achieve given the defenses most teams now use.
9043990	Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball).	Raising the rim would further increase the advantage of taller players, not decrease it. High school players are often short, and would not want the rim raised. It would neutralize the advantage of tall players.
9043593	There's little question that the 'dunk' has diminished the attraction of the NBA game. So often we see a seven-footer simply take a little stutter-step and drop it (not shoot it) through the hole. -- I grew up a fan of the NBA game but can't remember the last time I watched one. Eliminate the dunk and raise the rim.	The slam dunk has lessened the attraction of watching an NBA game. Seven-foot player don't even need to shoot the ball to get it in the hoop.
9051776	Having loved the skill, energy and movement in the pro game since seeing Wilt in an exhibition at the Garden in 1959 (when I was seven), why not first try these easier remedies to make each player more accountable: move the three point line back; stop the carrying while dribbling; get rid of the zone; and start calling giving two shots and the ball for deliberately hard fouls and not just excessively hard fouls; except in the fourth quarter, when all fouls become shooting fouls. The game in the 1960's and 1970's was a better quality game than the junk basketball that now prevails during the regular season. Oh yes: make a winning record on the road during the regular season much more significant.	Other, less dramatic changes, like moving the three-point line back and stricter rules enforcement, would be better than raising the rim.
9050964	This whole discussion is unwarranted. The commentators are making it sound like every possession is a fast break leading to a dunk. Dunks are still rare. I'm surprised when I see more than 8-10 per game. Quit trying to ruin the NBA for the rest of us by pining for the days of college-basketball level scoring.	The rim shouldn't be raised because dunks are still uncommon.
9048032	The rim is fine where it is, but dunking should not be allowed-- technically it is cheating. The ball is not supposed to be touched while in the cylinder as that is offensive goaltending. Remove the dunk exception for offensive goaltending from the rules and you will have a more challenging game, even if you lose some highlight reel plays. Of course I say this as an old guy who can no longer dunk.	Dunking should not be allowed. Getting rid of the dunk exception for offensive goaltending will make the game more challenging but reduce the number of highlight videos.
9053042	I've never studied James Naismith but I have a better idea of his thinking than you. In 1891 he was thinking that the average height of a full-grown male was about 5-1/2 feet. He invented the game for kids at the YMCA, not for those on some alien planet. His thinking was that the ball would be thrown UP to the basket, not dropped in from above.	The rim should be raise to account for human growth.
17282459	Students who rate professors negatively online anonymously do so because they (1) made a bad grade and want to blame the professor no matter what, or (2) failed to realize that a college education should challenge what they think, not placate them.	College is challenging and grades are the responsibility of the student.
16985201	Due respect to my colleague in academia, no one who frequents RMP would ever mistake it for a venue for constructive criticism. It serves mainly as a venting outlet for unprepared or underperforming students looking to punish their professors for actually enforcing standards - something many of them are experiencing for the first time in college, as K-12 muddles deadlines, caves to parent tantrums and teaches only to multiple-choice tests. Positive reviews are almost always vague, uninformative praise of habits that have nothing to do with actual learning ("awesome!" "Easy grader" "Super cool about napping in class")	RMP is not a venue for constructive criticism. Ratings are based more on emotions of the student who is struggling than the actual performance of the professor. Positive reviews lack true detail and often offer praise to unimportant things.
16973488	I taught in an honors pre law program, and another prof won the student popularity contest ( $5000) pretty much every year. Of course, he gave high and easy grades (>3.8/4) using the same tests/answers for 30 years. Our pragmatic but not too bright (or honest) chair also thought the student popularity poll really measured excellence in teaching.	Teachers who give high grades tend to be more popular.
16969415	RateMyTeacher.com, a corollary to RateMyProfessor.com, brings out the crazies and the malcontents. Over the past 12-15 years, the comments posted about me are often by disturbed students. Three times I've had to write the site to dispute a student's comments: One who said I knew nothing (I'd written a book on the subject), one who wrote because he was disgruntled about the way I tried to differentiate tests (mandated by the school), and another who commented that I was depressed (far from the truth) -- whom I doubt was even my student! I think the site is dangerous and invites trolling by students with severe misconceptions, those unhappy about grades, and those with gripes that would be better expressed in a face to face discussion. These posted comments affect a teacher's reputation and ability to find another job. I dread looking at the site to see what's there -- but on the other hand, I do look to see if there are comments that need to be removed because they are vicious or false.	Unfair things are said. Disturbed students are often the ones to post ratings. Students are able to make false claims against professors. Some people make these claims and may not even be real students. RateMyProfessor.com is dangerous and can lead to severe misconceptions that would be better expressed in a face to face discussion. The online ratings effect teacher's careers and are uncontrolled.
17042201	The appeal of a professor seems to me a very subjective matter. One professor might be completely inspiring and motivating for one student, but not for another. And perhaps relevant is that one would likely know nothing about the raters.	The quality of a professor is very subjective. The quality of the teaching is different for each student. Rating professors online reveals no contextual information on the person doing the rating.
17020722	I hope that most college students with sufficient intelligence and drive to deserve being in college will do the thing students have always done -- ask peers whose word and judgment you trust for their experience with a professor whose class you are considering.	It is fair to rate professors online because others do ask trusted peers for their impression of a professor whose class they are considering.
16987662	To echo Candide and others, professors who are on the market or do not have tenure often write their own reviews. Also, at my college all the student course evaluations are on-line, so I know that there is not much correlation between what a entire class says about a professor and what one random student says on-line.	Online review is unfair because professors will write their own for personal gain. One student's online ratings do not represent an entire class.
16986890	"Just as there are good and bad refrigerators, there are good and bad professors." Really? Anonymous on-line evaluations have been shown to be spurious. This is supported by published research and personal experience. Student evaluations of courses are strongly correlated to grade. Glaringly obvious when most variables are removed; e.g., comparing physics course sections covering identical material, taught by the same professor, in the same semester, and with the same assessment measures. NB, physics has the advantage that grades are based on scores, not potentially subjective measures, hence it was not the case that students' grades were influenced by the instructor's impression of them. More accurate measures are evaluations by trained, paid, identified peers and students. Education is a big investment - use evaluation tools that are robust, not junk.	Anonymous on-line evaluations have been shown to be spurious. Student evaluations tend to relate to their grades. Evaluations by trained, paid and identified peer and students are helpful, not junk evaluations.
16973545	The evaluations were either wonderful or abysmal. Most students said that I respected every student and welcomed every question, and then others said I belittled students for asking questions. I was both the best teacher ever, or the worst. I quit looking after a couple of semesters.	Online evaluations are inconsistent and conflicting.
16971054	Besides agreeing with many of the critical comments here, I woul dadd that a fundamental problem is that the ratings never seem to go away--a bad rating in 2005 or 2007 is stiil there in 2015, though it may no longer have any relevance--either because the teacher has improved or simply moved on--and some of the comments can be very personal and stinging, bad enough in the short term but sickening to see present 10 years after the fact of teh class. And the students who love your class often send a personal note rather than those motivated by a bad grade or a personal dislike to go online and punish you. It is not a good system--better to keep ratings within a particular school's walls.	Online ratings do not go away. A bad rating is still there years later, even if it no longer has relevance. Some comments are personal and can stick around online for years after the class. The students that enjoy your class are not motivated to leave ratings while the ones who received poor marks or did not like you will find a way to punish you. Ratings should stay within the school and not online.
16970462	"Rate My Professors helps me narrow down my choices. It tells me what my peers think of the various instructors." Wouldn't it be better to get this information directly from other students? A negative opinion from someone who complains about everything should not carry the same weight as a negative opinion from someone who is generally reasonable. If you're getting your "reviews" from your friends, roommates, etc, then you know how much weight to put their opinion - but you don't have it with the reviewers on Rate My Professor. I see RMP as primarily a tool for transfer students and online students -studetns who are on the outskirts of the student community - where information about professors flows freely. If you're a full-time second year student, however, your classmates, whose credibility you can assess, seem like a better resource.	Someone who generally makes reasonable statements opinion carries more weight that someone who is constantly negative. Rate My Professor reviews aren't just from those friendly to the professor. You can determine if you should trust your classmates opinion so this is a better option.
16969541	I think the concept of rating professors online (like just about any other form of public ratings) is ludicrous. To think that students attending a college where they are to be judged by a professor and given a grade for a class should be taken as fair and impartial in rating that professor's performance makes ZERO sense. Even worse, of course, are people who go out to eat and suddenly find themselves qualified to write for Gourmet Magazine. I read these reviews occasionally but NEVER take them seriously. Still, complaining will do nothing to stop this from occurring. Such are the times we live in and nothing is going to turn back the clock HOWEVER I, for one, think the concept is pretty repulsive and anyone or any institution that takes these ratings seriously is, by my definition, a person not to be taken seriously.	Students rating professors who have given the students grades are neither fair nor impartial.
16969471	Rate my Professor is essentially an internet scam to generate site traffic. I am sorry to see it getting this kind of free publicity in a serious paper like the NYT. Rate my Professor is a for-profit site. You can even post a review of someone without ever having taken a class with that person or on a class that the professor never taught. Try it. Most universities have systems for the evaluation of faculty. (I would be surprised if any do not.) They ensure that only students who actually took the class participate in the evaluation process.	Rating professors online is only used to generate internet traffic. Online ratings can be posted even if you have never taken the class or the professor has never taught that class.
16968143	I've taught college for 30 years. I often (admittedly with some sarcasm) tell my teaching assistants that students who do well take credit for it, and students who do badly blame the instructor. That is not true across the board, but there is some element of truth in it. As for Rate My Professor, I am in favor of it, even with its many flaws (pointed out by other contributors to this debate). Like so many things in modern life (including elections), we have to go with the best of the flawed possibilities. Yes, some of the criteria are irrelevant and even ridiculous (the hot peppers). But if a consensus of ratings in criteria that actually matter are good, then a student is probably wise to take that class. If the consensus is bad, then take a different one. (By the way, I never check my ratings. I am way too busy! But I read the written evaluations my students submit very carefully. They are probably a better representation of the whole class.)	The rating criteria is not quantifiable. As a whole online ratings will balance out and allow students to select a good class or professor.
16967643	Back in the day I recall getting my midterm and paper back while taking the final. The prof did not give me my paper during the exam because I had done poorly and he did not want me to lose my concentration. Nice guy. When I finally got the paper from him and he told me how bad it was I had to hold my tongue because he could still have failed me. Of course if I had known I was doing poorly in the class I would have gone to his office and asked him how I could improve. Ask what I was doing wrong. He had done nothing wrong and it was common for profs to do the minimum of work. I am so glad there is a forum now where people can be called out on their sloppy efforts.	It is fair to rate professors online as a way to reveal that many profs do a small amount of work. Forums allow professors to be called out on bad methods.
16966773	I teach college students. I am rated. I don't mind at all. In fact, when I was going to grad school, I checked the ratings, and even added my own rating of especially good profs. Students actually do know who is a good teacher and who is not. It's not always who gives the easy A. Those teachers are often dismissed just as easily. The teachers who are valued are still -- even now -- the ones who actually teach and stretch the minds and abilities of students. These will alway be considered the best teachers. Always. Students are not as clueless as you may think.	Students are good judges of a teacher's competency. Teachers who do outstanding jobs would still be rated as outstanding teachers. Students have a good perspective on their professors.
7528422	Diisasters can strike everywhere in the U.S. Floods, fires , tornados, hurricanes can strike a single state or an entire region. Why should it be the responsibility of a state to bear the brunt of the cost. It should be the responsibility of the entire nation to participate in the cost of cleaning up after disaster strikes one or a group of our states .We are Americans, not merely Jerseyites or Californians	Disasters can strike at anytime in the USA so a government program is needed. It shouldn't be the government's responsibilty to bear costs. If there is a disaster in one state, it is the nations job to help clean up.
7528221	FEMA's job seems to be mostly supplying money. We don't need a large organization to hand out money. Local officials, at least in my area, handle ALL of the disaster need - shelters, snow plows, tree cutting etc. And neighbords help one another. But then I suspect we are a more homogeneous community than say Gaithersburg, MD. Homogeneous communities and local officials are better at self-help than multi-cultural ones where you may not even speka the language of your neighbor or even know who they are. Generally I think local communities do a better job than FEMA which is more like bull in a china shop But we don't need such a huge agencies with so many federal employees to hand out money - it could be cut in size and still work well.	FEMA just hands out money. Disasters are locally handled by officials and neighbors. Local communities do a better job than huge agencies like FEMA.
5654207	The student loan system is a crime. Why banks can default and get bailed out, and young people who are conned into signing big education loans are locked in with no recourse, says a lot about our current society. Most universities have very large endowment funds, many of which are used like a predatory financial instrument to make more money in contemporary Wall St. casino capitalism. Add in the $10s, possibly $100s of billions misplaced during the Iraq War, not to mention the expenditure we know about and it's really mind boggling. How did it come to this? We won't find out because every agency capable of looking into it is compromised by money and ideology.	Banks can get bailed out, but young people with student loans are locked into debt.
5656530	I look at my resume and realize that despite having a Bachelors Degree in Communications, I still don't really have any jobs skills. My education failed me because it didn't provide me with any real specialized skill. And because of that, it seems like I"m destined to low paying office jobs as Office Assistants or Call Center Rep. I made the mistake of believing people when they said all I needed was a degree. They were wrong. All I can tell anyone is I'm barely proficent in MS Word and Excel, and I know how to press the start button on a copy machine. I somehow went through 4 years of college without learning anything real.	I have no job skills in spite of my Bachelors Degree in Communications. Writer's college failed to provide a specialized skill. College ought not be free for everyone because like requires more than a degree.
5645380	I'm an academic advisor in natural sciences at a big university; day after weary day I advise students with below average grades who have unrealistic expectations and cannot accept the fact that - contrary to what they've been told all of their lives - they cannot be a scientist or doctor. Virtually every day I advise one or more students with "B" averages in math, chemistry and biology who persist in the belief that they will get into medical school, all the while accumulating massive debt and wasting time. I don't even really have the hope that one day they will wake up; I forget who said that "most people can't stand too much reality."	Not everyone can be a scientist or a doctor and I am tired of advising these below average and unrealistic students. Many pre-medical students are not fit for medical school.
14086324	I have been waiting for so long for someone to ask me this question. The answer is yes. Thanks to the sociologist for pointing out that simplifying his field and inserting a heavy dose of philosophical bias has done very little to further our understanding of human behavior.	Quite simply put, yes.
14089467	Hmm, Given the Worldwide Meltdown less than a decade ago. The transfer of Trillions of Taxpayers dollars to the very Institutions that cause the Meltdown. The failure of most Economists to predict the Economic Disaster. And that simple reality that the Wall Street Hyenas are back at it again leads me to believe that Economics, were it a Science, and it most assuredly is not, is too complicated for humans to fully understand and so we are left at the mercy, of the Wall Streeters, who have none by the way, to ride the Economic Roller Coaster to our doom. p.s. Don't forget there are no boundaries to human greed.	Economists are overrated otherwise they would have seen last decades financial meltdown. Economists can't accurately predict an Economic Disaster. Economics is too complicated for human understanding.
14086452	Once we exclude some of ideas that came out of the University of Chicago (cradle of supply-side economics), economists have served society very well, I would say. Societies that tend to not value economics as a field (most of Middle East?) tend to have resource-based, inefficient economies.	Economists are useful to society and those that don't value them tend to have inefficient economies.
14085948	Weather forecasting is based upon analyzing well understood physical phenomena described by physics and chemistry and from better and better analyses of a vast amount of empirical evidence using advanced computer systems, and over the last half century has achieved a reliability of forecasting up to about a week ahead. Climate studies are used to predict long term trends without any expectation of precision as we expect of weather forecasting. When one looks at economics one does not have the grasp of the fundamental phenomena as I weather and thus the data cannot offer as must reliability in explaining what is going on or what can be expected as does weather forecasting, yet, people often try to rely upon economic forecasts going out decades into the future when most economic forecasts are rarely accurate further than a few weeks and sometimes even wrong about current activities based upon estimations in lieu of compiled data.	If you would look at financial forecasts as I do, as a weather analyst,realizing that forecasts that try to go out for decades and can only hold to a model for a matter of weeks, while using questionable data as a base, can in no way be accurate.
14085524	Ridiculous. There IS no sustained track record of success in economics. No modelling that has shown sustainable strength. No new ways of thinking about the creation and movement of wealth. Economics is not 'the Dismal Science'. It's not science at all.	Economists do not have proven success. Economics is not science.
14086462	I can think of of two large problems: 1. Economics is far from an exact science, with precise terminology, methods of proof, and purpose. 2. It has impact affecting our personal standards of living, therefore it is hard to have a cool head and argue and think about economics from an objective point of view.	Economics lacks precise terminology, methods of proof, and purpose. Economics is hard to objectify with a cool head.
14084917	After working in finance for long enough, I went back to school in an Economics Graduate program. Absolutely fascinated by the intricate mathematical modeling and discussions about the sign of the second derivative of some elaborate equation, indicating an unseen truth about the complexity of the world. Soon enough I realized that the discussion participants could not care less about that grand topic -- it was strictly an appeal to math wizardry. Amusing, but essentially worthless theory.	Most discussion participants did not care about economics. Economists are worthless.
14082552	The problem is that economic expertise is primarily used by politicians in only convenient, self-serving ways. As someone who majored in economics as an undergraduate at a top liberal arts college, I have found that I can easily discern principled use of economic science from self-serving use. I can also say that over the last 20 years, the impact of macro-economic policy, both fiscal and monetary, has NEVER surprised me. It's also clear to me that many things in this world are primarily driven by things outside the realm of economics. It saddens me that so many professional economists are willing to rent out their professional reputation so cheaply, and to debase the profession so casually. I can't blame the public for dismissing economists generally, but I can lament that the ability to make the world a better place is so casually and needlessly wasted by political opportunists.	Economic expertise is typically self-serving. The macro-economic policy is not surprising. Economics doesn't control everything in the world.
14087275	Next week the Times could sponsor a debate as to whether journalism is over-rated. And then we could debate whether law is based on pseudoscience. And maybe next a debate on democracy could provide a forum for yet another group made invidious by Nobel Prizes and statistical models providing a rational way forward. Commenters have hit new lows in identifying assumptions (straw horses) not made by their enemies, in somehow tying economic theory to tax-cuts-for-rich Republicans who don't know the first thing about markets, and in claiming that economists don't study institutions (never mind decades of thoughtful research on every institution connected to economics, from the family, to neighborhoods, to churches an non-profits, to labor unions, to institutions of government (isn't the Fed an institution?). And economists don't study complex patterns among hosts of variables? - give me a break. Perhaps the authors of this particular article should consider all the commenters' barbs that apply equally to sociology and any other social science. The Republican know-nothings have been joined by the anti-science pundits and commenters herein.	Republicans don't understand how the economy truly works and what is best for everyone, instead just their favored group.
14083548	Patterson and Fosse are mistaking the University of Chicago for Economics in general. The problem in policy is that in disagrees strongly, especially in Europe, with mainstream economic thought. And a major contributor to European problems, the euro, is the result of ignoring warnings from economists who study money.	Often economic policy does not agree with mainstream thinking, especially in Europe. The Euro is a direct result of countries ignoring economists.
14083444	Harvard is arguably the worst offender -- their Econ faculty regularly publish articles to the broader mainstream press in which they prognosticate, often highly incorrectly. Yet somehow the prestige of an economist from Harvard seem to carry weight in the press anyway.	Harvard produces horrible economists. Often, they publish articles that are completely incorrect yet somehow if they graduated from an Ivy league college, we still try to place value on their words.
10721381	I would give anything to have an enlightened monarch - think Prince Charles - in a position of power in the United States! I only wish he was King of England already, though if he were President of the US, instead of King of England, it would be even better! Just imagine, someone above the fray, and completely committed to the welfare of the planet.	The monarch might  be committed to the planet, not the fray.
10752636	7 out of the 10 most prosperous countries in the world are constitutional monarchies as well as 7 out 10 most democratic countries. Constitutional monarchies are the most successful form of government in todays world. The US ranks 12th for prosperity and 21st for democracy.	Constitutional monarchies can be as stable and prosperous as democracies. Constitutional monarchies are a very successful form of government today.
10716571	The only concrete definition of royalty I can think of is rule by decree as opposed to rule by consent. Furthermore, it doesn't make any difference if one attains royalty through heredity, voter fraud or simply by buying an election. The result is the same in each case, i.e., the right to rule was gained without the consent of the governed. It must be Bhutan was very lucky because I can't think of any other royal ruler who went down in history as having consistently issued decrees that were in the best interests of those he (or she, in some rare cases) governed. Personally, I would never willingly give up my democratic right to get rid of leaders whose decrees failed this test. We're all human after all and thus everyone is certain to make mistakes eventually. The idea that someone with ultimate power would have the right to make mistakes with no fear that the consequences could result in their removal is, well, beyond reason.	Democracies require that the right to rule is gained with the consent of the governed. I would not want to give up the democratic right to get rid of leaders. Having all the power of the state in the hands of one man, he is destined to make mistakes because all humans do. Democracies ought not have monarchs because the premise of ultimate power without no repercussions for bad governing is nonsense.
2700870	What is the need for every college to have a French department? I'm a francophile, and took French in elementary school in south Florida. (Spanish would have been much more useful) Nonetheless, I have no problem with eliminating French language instruction at some colleges and universities. There will surely be many that will continue to offer French, and those who value it will seek them out. It's called specialization.	Even if some colleges eliminate French language programs, surely others will keep them and they will be sought out by people who value them.
2700434	Anne, I believe this discussion is wrongly focused. A university that does not offer study in major languages,classics, or theater is in a sorry state. The value of offering study in the humanities should not need defending. The question, "should the humanities be preserved?", is absurd and offensive. A more proper question for the state of New York is "should SUNY Albany be preserved?". Seriously. SUNY suffers more than 60 campuses. The elimination of the humanities at one of the larger SUNY locations is a wake up call. It is time to consolidate the sprawling SUNY system so that the surviving campuses can operate competently. No one can foresee when a degree in the humanities will become "hot" again. SUNY Albany has chosen to ransom its future. So be it.	Colleges with prestige should offer languages and other humanities. The value of studying humanities should not need to be defended.
2701368	I agree with many of the comments that emphasize the general value of a humanities education. But have we forgotten that someone trains future K-12 educators in the humanities? The K-12 public education system will continue to employ hundreds of thousands of people, and everyone agrees that a broad education is appropriate at this level. Lower tier colleges train future teachers -- in that sense, these courses are part of a vocational training.	Humanities train teachers to teach a broad education at the K-12 level. Humanities programs are part of vocational training.
2699253	Methinks none of the commentators have tried getting a job as a recent graduate lately. It's nice to be able to study humanities in college, I studied French myself. However, college and life cost money, and employers are rarely as impressed with a philosophy degree and excellent command of Latin as with an economics degree and proficient Mandarin. Times change and so must education, unless any of the commentators would like to help unemployed classics majors repay their student loans.	Students need to become proficient in Economics and Mandarin in order to impress employers and earn the money necessary for college and life. Colleges should change with the times.
2699104	Making sense does not mean making cents. It makes sense to build sewers, roads, and bridges. But the private sector does not undertake these infrastructure projects because it doesn't make cents (even though these infrastructure projects were an essential foundation upon which private enterprise made its cents). The good sense of the public has funded these infrastructure projects through taxes, for cents on the dollar and for the benefit of the public and private enterprise. The humanities and the arts are the infrastructure of the mind that produces adults who make sense and make cents. I hope the good sense of the public will continue to fund the construction of these humanities programs.	Infrastructure programs that have been funded through taxes have benefited public and private enterprise. Humanities programs make people think differently and more creatively.
2701138	There are college graduates who cannot find Afghanistan on a map, or explain the difference between the World Bank and the IMF, or explain the parallels between the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and The Fall of Saigon. We need humanities so that graduates can have an advance understanding of how the world beyond their profession operates. Humanities are our insurance policy against the creation of a nation full of college-educated meatheads.	Colleges need humanities programs to train graduates who have an advanced understanding of the world beyond their profession. Humanities courses ensure students are exposed to other cultures.
2700894	The humanities, especially at 'research' universities, can be more for the professors than the students. But cuts in the humanities and liberal arts will generate a society of one-dimensional engineers. Nothing wrong with engineers (some of my best friends are engineers!), but they then are unsophisticated societally, and become more vulnerable to demogoguery and other like-mindless politics. Man may eat by bread alone, and we need to have it buttered, but there's a need to be able to figure out which side is buttered.	Without humanities students all graduates will be science-based. Humanities programs create a full minded citizen immune to being easily controlled.
2700862	I'm dismayed at the number of comments that miss the point, which is that we need to preserve the integrity of our intellectual tradition. Piecemeal budget cuts are a bad thing. This is not a battle between science and the humanities; it's a battle FOR a flourishing intellectual ecosystem, which is so complex as evolved that, as with the natural ecosystem, we shouldn't be driving niches into extinction. There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes. So the argument isn't necessarily that French departments, or classics or Russian, are there to produce an army of majors. (Just enough to keep the discipline alive.) They are there to enrich everybody.	Colleges should preserve the integrity of the intellectual tradition. We should support humanities programs to create a intellectual ecosystem that is complex and evolved. Humanities and the sciences are complementary disciplines. Humanities programs are meant to enrich everyone.
2700850	All I can say is, I've never been so convinced of the need for humanities since I started to teach at a law school. To be anything but an ambulance chaser students need to be able to think critically and outside the box. You can major in the history of cheesecake for all I care, but if you haven't learned how to read, write, and think creatively--that is, for the most part, haven't had a liberal arts education--you're not going to make a good lawyer.	Colleges need humanities programs because disciplines such as law do not teach the same material. Students need to think critically and outside of conventional ideas. Liberal arts provide knowledge to learn creative thinking, reading, and writing which are important to many career paths.
2700718	"I must study politics and war, that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigations commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain." Letters of John Addams Addressed to his Wife, edited by Charles Francis Adams [1841}, vol. II, letter 78 [1780]	Appreciation of the humanities is life affirming and enhancing but the ability to study humanities comes at a cost.
2700703	While I don't support seeing college as only a place of professional training, even from a professional standpoint it is short-sighted to argue that we don't need many of the programs schools think about cutting. Take French for example. While not a major language here in the US, it is spoken in large parts of Africa and is an official language of most of the major international organizations including the UN. In fact, in my work as a project manager with an international public health organization, it was actually my French studies that were the MOST directly relevant part of my academic background, and fluent French were highly valued for their language skills.	Colleges need to be more than just for professional development. Colleges need French. My French studies were the most relevant part of my academics background; being fluent in French is highly valuable.
2700020	f the humanities were a requirement at all American universities and students were forced to analyze the thoughts and writings of great authors and philosophers the world over, perhaps we would not have the corruption in the business, political and corporate worlds we find today. We all need to confront the human dilemmas so that we can think about what we might do in similar circumstances. As we can see at this very moment, American politicians, bankers, corporations have no respect for others' opinions or for ethics. How dare we send our troops into harm's way into other countries when we have no understanding of their cultures or history?Never has an understanding of other cultures been so important as today. It is criminal to drop the humanities, and France and Russia are pillars of our civilization.	If students were required to take humanities, perhaps we would have less corruption in the business, political, and corporate worlds. Humanities help students to think about human dilemmas in a personal way. we cannot effectively send troops and other aid to other countries if they do not first understand the languages and cultures of the area. Understanding other culture is more important now than ever before.
2699822	People who speak three languages are trilingual. People who speak two languages are bilingual. People who speak a single language are...for the most part...Americans. We need to ensure that the opportunity to acquire language competencies (and hopefully proficiencies) remain part of higher education. We need to encourage students of all ages and backgrounds to attain and maintain those proficiencies. Whether that can be accomplished on a large scale by distance learning using well-established tools (e.g. Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur, or other methods) needs to be explored.	Colleges need to ensure that opportunity to acquire language remains part of higher education. All college students need to gain proficiency in he humanities.
2699780	While many science and technology workers around the world speak English, certainly not all of them do. There are software companies and engineering firms all over the world where having Americans who speak these languages -- along with being able to communicate in the cultural context in which these languages exist -- is an advantage, or even a requirement to do business. Berlitz doesn't teach how to communicate engineering concepts in German, or how to sell email marketing in France, or how to gain competitive advantage in Hong Kong by knowing the language and culture. While some do feel that we should be turning out nothing but professional vocational degrees from colleges and universities, I would like to point out that my colleagues in science and technology are often terrible at communication -- language, context and culture (including American English) -- unless they study it.	Not all science and technology workers speak English. Language programs assist in communication between international companies. Humanities programs teach communication, which is important.
2699711	BTW, I don't know about the West, but in Russia the sure way to be come a successful (sometimes great) writer seems to be to study Medicine or Engineering. Leo Tolstoy was an artillery officer and a fortification engineer, Anton Checkhov was a doctor, Michail Bulgakov was a doctor (and practiced for a while), and the lsit can be continued on and on. You see, it looks like it is relatively simple to learn French later in your life, if you so inclined, but it is much harder to become a successfull engineer or a doctor or a scientist. That's why I teach my kids - get a real job first, if you want to study Medieval English Literature, you can always do it as a hobby later on. My older kid (a high school senoir), accidentally, has had a straight A in French for the last 5 years... :)	Humanities programs teach non-essential information.
2699604	As a recent MIT graduate, I feel I've seen firsthand what results when even the most brilliant college students don't sufficiently value humanities. I had to explain to a top computer scientist that as long as thousands of years ago, there were civilizations with human beings who knew how to read and write and were essentially as smart as us. Somehow, all his scientific knowledge about evolution still left him unconvinced that the Greeks and Romans may have had something to teach us. Only after I handed him a copy of Plato did he get the point. Furthermore, unless engineering-types are required to take humanities classes (at a college level, not just in high school), many of them won't. This is an injustice to society as much as to those individuals, who may never realize what they are missing.	Technology does not make people smarter, humans are just as smart as they ever were. Humanities help students to appreciate early teachings of Greeks and Romans. Requiring humanities will broaden the education of engineers. This would be a major loss to society as a whole, and people would miss out on an amazing experience.
2699541	Cultivating what imagination? Our schools are turning into test taking factories where the emphasis is in passing the take no prisoners do or die high stakes NCLB exams. Only two subjects matter these days--reading and math. The rest is nothing but alot of expensive twaddle that the stressed out taxpayers just can't afford. Want to learn French? Go to Berlitz	Humanities programs are a waste of taxpayer money with no result.
2699528	These cuts could lead to an examination of the humanities in science and engineerings programs. As an engineering student I took anthropology, history, economics, and psychology courses. They were more useful than the electives in nuclear engineering. Economics was required for engineers, very reasonably, and the the psychology was required by the Navy ROTC, also with good reason. Humanities and context to science, and humanities and science together would improve the quality of many current issues, climate change is an obvious example.	Cuts in universities could lead to examinations of humanities in other programs. Humanities programs improve understanding of current issues.
2699456	The Humanities are our values and we are loosing more and more of them. The result is the Tea Party movement, a group of people who repeat buzz words with no understanding of their true meaning. We are gradually becoming Weimar German (the meaning of that can be found in a book somewhere in a Humanities department text-book, which is being thrown away).The result is this country is being sold to the highest bidder and the foolish American public has no clue to the ramifications.	Humanities represent societal values and removing them impacts us negatively. We are slowly turning into Weimar German. Humanities are still important in our society and should not be eliminated because they are not viewed as leading to a profitable career.
2699366	Very simple question: who is going to pay for this? Convince me, an average Joe Shmo, that my buck, spent for Medieval History or French Poetry of 18th Century studies, will actually do good, and I'll gladly pay. But so far I see just a bunch of snobs that look at me down their noses and say: you don't understand anything, just give us your money! Those who chose humanities as their occupation and way of life, should just be prepared to starve from time to time. I think it is very noble, if you guys have the goal to make the World better, not just earn some bucks.	Who would be paying for the humanities programs?. If you can show me how my tax money for French poetry and the such benefits anyone and I will gladly pay. Colleges do not need additional humanities programs.
2699328	As a French-speaking Canadian who obviously understands English, when I saw the title of the article I was looking forward to the debaters' comments. Yet no one answers the question: do colleges need French departments? Nobody mentions the unique perspective French culture, literature, philosophy and language can bring to students. Nor does any debater write about the worthlessness of French, should that be their opinion. Were there no debaters who knew something about French? And when I mention French, I refer to all countries that, through history and to this day, have lived and still live in French as well as those countries, such as the United States, that have pockets of citizens that live and think in French. If the debate was not about French departments then there is a subtle English code that I fail to decrypt.	Studies in the humanities are important because they expose students to subjects that help to expand their minds and think creatively.
2699384	It would be a shame for universities to give up the teaching of French; it is a language spoken throughout Europe. Even if we don't master the language,it is a wonderful help when traveling. The same people who will go on to financial success after college are the people who will spend vacation time touring France and Italy. Of course, the humblest waiter in France understands some English but an American appears uneducated if he/she can't even attempt speaking some French. We can't expect that all foreigners have studied English when we haven't studied some foreign language ourselves.	French is a language that is used all throughout Europe. Learning just some French can help with travelling. Those who find successful careers after college often spend their time touring Europe after they are done with their education. Americans need to learn about other cultures.
2699299	One would think that SUNY believes that the only goal to an education is to find a job and moreover, that the only jobs that exist (or are worth pursuing) are related to math and science. This would seem to ignore the vast number of jobs that require creativity, langauge skiils, communication skills, and cultural understanding on a global level, not to mention countless others. I am a resaonably successful attorney and can think of no better degree for my personal and professional development and satisfaction than my undergraduate degree in French.	The humanities are important for developing a student's creative and critical thinking which are important skills for succeeding in a global economy. My undergraduate degree helps with my personal and professional development and satisfaction.
2699263	As a recent college graduate with a degree in French, I have to say that I am disappointed that foreign language literatures are first on the chopping block. Not only does the study of literature prompt students to critically analyze texts and articulate arguments in writing, it provides students with a more well-rounded and global view of a discipline that all too often focuses on old dead white British and American men. As a student of French I have had an enormous exposure to the cultural and political issues that dominate North African, West African, and Carribean peoples. Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France. It would really be a shame to see this multifaceted and dynamic discipline disappear from some Universities because of uninformed notions that the study of French is nothing more than an American romanticization and fetishization of a European culture and language.	Studying literature develops critical analysis and writing skills. It offers a wider perspective when it comes to education instead of simply focusing on a curriculum that was created by old white British and American men. I have broadened the scope of my knowledge to include issues relating to North African, West African, and Carribbean peoples. I have learned to understand American immigration from my studies in Chicano literature and that of North African immigrants in France.
2698806	The U.S. desperately needs to strengthen its ties to the larger world. All of its failures stem from its traditional and on-going isolation. The Humanities, and in particular, the acquisition of a foreign language (culture, literature, history, alternative ways of living), are vital to broadening the professional lives of all young Americans. The study of French is the doorway to understanding our own background (some 40% of English derives from French), our history, our identity. Cutting such vital elements of education is in fact suicidal for U.S. society.	The US's failures come from its ongoing isolation, and needs to strengthen its ties to the larger world. The humanities are vital to a broad and professional education. French language study helps with understanding culture. Cutting humanities departments is suicidal for US society.
2698616	Cutting these programs will deprive Americans enrolled at US universities of the broader and deeper intellect they need to compete in the global economy. I specify Americans, because all the non-American students acquire multi-lingual fluency in the home countries, etc. I acquired fluency in German while taking it at Indiana University as a minor. That skill has made all the difference in my 30-year marketing career.	Americans will be deprived of the broader and deeper intellect they need to compete in the global economy if these programs are cut.
2698446	This debate is misleadingly headlined "Do Colleges Need French Departments?". I say that because Nussbaum, and most of the others who have answered after her, are addressing the much bigger question of "With humanities programs being cut at many universities, what do students stand to lose?" I agree with most of what Nussbaum says, but my take on it is this: money is short, and we need to use it more wisely to ensure that all university students get a good education in humanities, be they future businesspeople, engineers or journalists. The existence of this or that four-year degree, or a given department, doesn't mean this will necessarily happen.	In my opinion if money is lacking then it needs to be spent more wisely in the humanities to ensure that every field has a grounding in them.
2699622	Having lived in Germany (Army bases) and traveled widely, I am well aware of that there are few Americans that can speak foreign languages. Most Americans cannot understand why someone would want to learn a foreign language. Having said that, my 5-6 years of French and limited German never proved of much use in those countries (many Germans speak English, and the French are less than helpful to foreigners trying to speak their language) or elsewhere. Later in life I took up Spanish, and this has proved to be very useful in travel and being able to practice it on a regular basis (Washington, DC area). I think that the colleges need to rethink their language curriculum. At an east coast boarding school I attended in the '60s, Latin classes were mandatory absent a waiver. The world has changed and French use in the world has changed dramatically. Colleges need to take this into account. It is a shame to have people spend years on these languages and then never using them in their adult life. BTW I have one niece taking college Arabic and another taking high school Spanish.	Few Americans can speak foreign languages. Limited foreign language study is not enough to be effective in those countries. Spanish classes were very useful when travelling.
2701458	I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours. As I found out, when you make a profession out of the humanities, it leads to crass careerism and outlandish theory.	I lost my enthusiasm for humanities when I realized success was was more politics and high theory than a dedication to teach literature. The internet provides this kind of information for free. Humanities should be for recreation.
2701233	I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.	The humanities help students learn about many areas of human thinking and accomplishment.
2701148	While I was getting my doctorate at Harvard, I wrote two articles saying basically the same thing Prof Bauerlein says here. In both cases readers attacked me as reactionary (Tea Partiers would likely call me a Communist) and argued for the importance of abstruse theory. Even though I have a PhD in medieval literature, I wonder if there's any point in saving the humanities at the university level. It's become a sewer. A sewer of fashionable theory. I remember one faculty member at Harvard proudly justifying the decision to give tenure to a woefully underqualified professor of Spanish literature on the grounds that the department "needed" an openly gay professor who could teach about things like gay pride and gay rage. The two articles I refer to are: "Apartheid in the Curriculum." Harvard Magazine, January-February 1992, p. 14. "A Crit of Lit: Teaching Literature in the Ivory Tower." Perspective, vol. X, no. 3 (April 1993), 8 ff. Reprinted vol. X, no. 5 (summer 1993), 20 ff.	Humanities at the university level have become a sewer and it is pointless to save them.
2700867	The skillset involved in learning to write clear, concise and engaging prose will not go out of date. Ditto the ability to evaluate and process information from a disparate range of sources, or to listen compassionately or (heavens!) communicate with someone else in THEIR language. Why has no one mentioned that French is still the lingua franca of many African nations, one of two official languages of our neighbors to the north, and a significant language throughout Europe?	There is always a need for people to know how to write well and engage an audience is a timeless skill. Humanities help students to process information and communicate with other people more effectively, sometimes in other languages.
2698988	This is the one post that I agree with. The humanities are that: a human endeavor. Language is probably the most important thing we do, both physically and mentally. It's what makes us human. Ultimately this takes us back to a question the Greeks often asked: what's a good life? What's rewarding, what's fulfilling? These days we all live relatively well, compared to our ancestors at least. Is it absolutely necessity to think purely in terms of utility? I have an HDTV, is it absolutely necessary I have a 3dTV tomorrow? Why? Studying languages and being able to communicate successfully gives insight into culture, gesture, and structure; how is that not useful? I study languages on a daily basis, and I'm not that good at them as I get older. But I liken it to exercising, like front squatting or distance running; somehow, deep down, I know it's good for me.	The programs are a study of humanity itself. College needs humanities programs because language is what makes us human. Studying languages aids in communication and can help students learn about other cultures.
11994755	That's absolutely right! The one-country/one-vote system means that it becomes all too easy to corrupt the voting system by offering inducements/bribes to representatives of poor countries. However, to change the system to favour the developed world cannot be the way to go, neither in the UN nor in FIFA. My preference (hardly ideal, but practical) would be to have a rotation of World Cup venues: Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, Middle East. This would not eradicate corruption, but might well limit its scope. And, btw, it would be a very good idea to have term limits on elected FIFA executives. Blatter after Havelange is a sequence that does not inspire confidence.	A one-country/one-vote system would be too easy to corrupt. Soccer really needs FIFA, but protections need to be in place so the developed word is not favored.
19585313	Turner's argument that Obamacare is inherently flawed and cannot be made to work overlooks some important counterexamples, including the success of the Swiss (and to a lesser extent the Dutch) healthcare system. Furthermore, the same basic premise (guaranteed coverage across a large risk pool without adverse selection) is working well even in America, in large employer-subsidized group plans. A responsible market-oriented conservative would be asking why Obamacare isn't working as well as those plans, not seeking to bury it without any serious analysis.	Taking a cue from the success of the Swiss and Dutch healthcare models proves Obamacare can work, too.
19589539	Medicare for anyone who wishes to enroll, regardless of age or employment status? Yes. It is long past time to see health care as a necessity of survival rather than a privilege of wealth. Premiums tied to age and income, with no penalty for being diabetic, being a survivor of cancer treatment, being mentally ill. How un-American can you get? Maybe it's time we eliminated the profit motive from some aspects of survival.	Healthcare should be a right, not a priveledge.
19588791	The American public is being taken for a ride. The Left knew all along the Obamacare model would fail, paving the way for the PUBLIC OPTION. The Left believe that the people cannot be trusted to elect the politicians who would propose the PO in congress and take the heat for it. Instead the Left resorts to flim-flam tactics like Obamacare. There is no trust in government and this flim-flam is a big reason why.	The American public is being lied to.
19587204	Health Insurance may still be a functioning industry (barely), but HEALTH CARE is a market failure. As such, the only solution is a single payer system paid through payroll and/or income taxes--everybody pays something. Cut out the profits, pay off medical school debt for doctors and then pay them as government workers, based on their level of expertise.	Health care is a market failure, even if Health Insurance is still barely functioning. A single payer system is the only solution.
19587171	My take away lesson from these years of ACA is that we were sold a political promise that like too many was a lie. The Republicans dont have to raise their little finger for this program to fail, it will die of its own losses. Where are the number guys and what do they say about it now, the guys who were touting the program for Mr. Obama? Its a wonderful warm and fuzzy notion to fund healthcare for everyone, and in countries that pay their doctors around 50,000 a year and drugs aren't outrageous etc etc, it may be feasible, but thats not the USA. Check out how much money the drug companies pay our politicians for example. Those tens of millions of dollars comes from the citizens and their insurance in an endless cycle of financial and political imbalance that is always spiraling towards that 1%.	Healthcare for all is feasible in some countries, but not the USA. Drug companies pay politicians.
19586865	Of course it's sustainable but the party (republican) in control of congress wants it to fail and has thrown every roadblock in its way that they could. If they had actually worked with the democrats, we could have had a much better plan. For almost 8 years now, they've refused to help in running the country and have tried to block everything.	Obamacare is sustainable but the republicans want it to fail so they are throwing up all the roadblocks they can.
19586126	With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff. If the trend continues, AFA is not sustainable.	Obamacare makes it impossible for insurance companies to price based on pre-existing conditions and this causes insurance prices across the board to increase. The Affordable Care At is being dropped by Aetna in 11 of the 15 states it is available in because it's lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Insurance companies should not be governed by government policies.
19585052	America will never be a truly great country until health care is provided for all for little to no cost. We pay for public education whether we want to or not, we pay for wars that cost trillions. The U.S. can afford health care for all. Just do it.	Health care will make America great when it does not cost much. We spend trillions on wars and pay for public education. Healthcare is still affordable for the United States.
19606026	As a Medicare provider, I see confusion on the part of most of my patients, and a serious decline in my reimbursement rate. Patients seem to look first to cost (monthly premium and pharmaceuticals), then to services. Large insurers (Aetna, Humana, Blue Cross) are in the business of making money, not providing services. Medicare (as an insurance company) is in the business of cost-control for established medical services. As long as medical care is dependent on a business model (i.e., competition), and not disease management, we will be forever in a conundrum. Healthcare needs to become a right, not a benefit.	Most of my patients, as a Medicare provider, are confused and my reimbursement rate is declining. Customers prioritize cost over anything else. Mega sized insurance companies aren't looking to provide services, they are only seeking to make more profits. Medical care should be dependent on disease management, not a business model.
11967782	"Marijuana Is Now Big Business" Wrong - marijuana has been big business for decades. The California Dept. of Agriculture has listed it as the number one cash crop in the state for over 20 years in a row. Now, the business is above ground, where it should be. Regulation, taxation, better education, savings in enforcement and incarceration costs - everybody wins. We are slowly now heading in the right direction - ending the biggest and most widespread wrongful jailing of American citizens since slavery. It can't happen quick enough.	Pot has been the number one cash crop in California for over 20 years - it benefits everyone via regulation, taxation, education, savings in enforcement and incarceration costs. Ending the prohibition on marijuana would ensure that fewer citizens are unfairly jailed.
11965227	Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels. By Friedman's definition, professional drug-warriors like Kevin Sabet, with their relentless, decades long campaign to incarcerate marijuana users, help cartels and drug gangs maintain their markets. A new, legal, regulated market for marijuana will have problems, but that system will replace a brutal, totally unregulated black market that rarely asks for a driver's license before making a sale. Mr. Sabet makes a show of concern for public health, but turns a blind eye to the damage done when young people are arrested, strip-searched and thrown into cells with violent criminals and rapists. The ACLU reports 749,825 arrested for marijuana in 2012.	Government when it comes to illegal drugs is to protect us from drug cartels. The activities of drug-warriors ensure that cartels and drug gangs keep their markets going. A regulated market has replaced an unregulated and dangerous black market. There was a low number of arrests for marijuana.
11968452	Legalization is just too dangerous, says Ms. Evins. Has she studied the Rat Park experiments? Conducted over 20 years in a prestigious lab, then published as peer-reviewed journal studies, they establish that addiction is almost impossible to induce when the subjects are living in healthy environments. Oh, one detail: the subjects were rats...which correlate to humans 80% of the time in lab study results. So there's an 80% chance that human addiction results not from the substance but from deprived, abusive environments. There is a place she could put her efforts productively, instead of fighting a losing battle against a public jaded by decades of lies.	Research on marijuana was conducted for 20 years before being made legal in Colorado. Addiction is almost impossible when the subjects are happy and healthy. There is a high chance that addiction actually stems from bad environments rather than the substance itself.
11970354	The juvenile attitude in which people treat legalization is embarrassing. We need more study? Contrary to what some believe, cannabis has been around forever, and people have been smoking it forever. We don't need more study, we need to legalize and treat our populace like adults. We do so many things that are much more dangerous but we don't go to jail for them.	Humans have know about and used cannabis for a long time. Adults should be able to make their own choices. There are much more dangerous things than smoking pot that are not illegal.
11970504	. Do alcohol and marijuana affect some users negatively? Absolutely. Should minors be allowed to legally consume either one? No. But the war on drugs is a failure. All it does is promote violence and enrich big time drug dealers and the utterly corrupt interdiction apparatus both in the U.S. and abroad. I don't endorse the use of either marijuana or alcohol. But making them illegal protects no one.	The war on drugs has failed. Making  marijuana or alcohol illegal protects no one.
11967887	The U.S. DHHS estimated, in 2008, that more than 18% of our population smokes pot. More than 55 million Americans. Under prohibition they are all subject to becoming coerced by the courts "patients" of Prof. Evins and her profession cohorts. Legalized she, and her pharmaceutical industry sponsors, lose that potential court ordered government business. Dr. Evins CV: "Dr. Evins has been the recipient of a career development award from theNational Institutes of Drug Abuse (NIDA)" "Career development" indeed.	Colorado did not go to far because 55 million Americans are already using pot.
11965391	We have hundreds of thousands of scientists; we have hundreds of major universities; and millions of marijuana users over the last fifty years. So, why so little good research? Blame the federal government which made marijuana research unduly difficult. and similar foreign governments. A Catch 22: little research since marijuana is illegal; illegal party because little research showing it is relatively safe. Somebody had to blow this dam of repression sky high; Colorado has done this. Now, belatedly, the research can go on.	There is not enough research on marijuana. Since Colorado has legalized weed, research can be done as to how successful that policy is.
11966497	Arguments such as these frustrate me. When Dr. Evins comes up with a solution to the downsides of keeping marijuana illegal (which any 16-year old in the country can find now without any difficulty whatsoever), not limited to the money flowing to drug cartels, the violence associated with illegal distribution, the racial and ethnic differences in lives lost, ruined and diminished due to disparities in criminal justice processing, (should I go on?), I'll take state control and distribution any day of the week. If she wants to whine about the marketing to children, tell her to go whine to all those free-market Republicans who believe that the markets can do no harm. Maybe they should be required to take the Hippocratic Oath.	Colorado's legal pot deters crime and reduces jailing of minorities. State control and distribution of pot is something I can support.
11965482	I'd like to know where Dr. Evins is getting her statistics. They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause "like memory and cognitive impairment"--TEMPORARILY. It's called "being stoned".	Marijuana used to be a social drug. Colorado legalizing marijuana had little impact on society. I never met anyone addicted to pot. Marijuana only causes temporary memory and cognitive impairment - being stoned.
11963803	I hate pot. I think putting it in candy is stupid. However, even though I gave it up after 2 years of thinking thee must be something wrong with me for not enjoying it, I came to the conclusion that it was so far from addictive that it probably drove some people to abandon it in favor of mindless drug like cocaine, heroin or beer and booze. If the AMA and foolish and misinformed people like MS Evins believe the nonsense they spread; let them sleep alone. I suspect that almost all hardcore users of pot are already using it. If Ms Evins were truly honest ,she would be pushing for re-enactment of alcohol prohibition, which , like all drug prohibitions, didn't work either, but was at least based upon a great deal of experimental and observed fact. All our history with marijuana is based upon the predilections of one side or the other in the argument over it's status.	Marijuana is so far from addictive that it drove some to abandon it in favor of harder drugs. Most marijuana users aren't influenced by the ruling. Alcohol is more dangerous then marijuana. Marijuana is labeled by one side or the other as what they want it to be.
11965507	Is there any other substance whose legal status is dependent upon ALL users to be completely responsible upstanding citizens? Imagine if we debated outlawing soda because it was found that kids involved in school shootings consumed it. Fortunately, due to Bloomberg's attempts to just limit sizes, I know that the American Beverage Association would be there to remind us that it's not about protecting us from ourselves, but about our choices as Americans! It's not just alcohol that gets a different standard, it's literally everything that's not cannabis.	No substances require users to verify they are completely responsible citizens. Everything that isn't pot is subject to a double standard so Colorado didn't go too far with pot.
18321898	We put limitations on a number of felons once their time has been served, sex offenders must register and their housing options are limited. Child molesters are limited in the jobs and activities the can have. I believe felons should be able to petition the courts and demonstrate they are a solid citizen and their full citizenship rights should be restored. Gun ownership should never be restored to violent felons. Just one man's opinion.	Felons are already limited enough. Felons should be able to have their full citizenship rights restored if they can demonstrate they are a solid citizen.
18321856	I agree that once an obligation to Society has been made by serving the penalty assessed at trial, the felon should be restored to full citizenship. Having said that I would add a period of time, say five years of good behavior after release from prison, before voting rights are restored. There should be a burden of proof that a felon must endure to prove that he or she can be a good citizen once again before voting rights can be exercised. This can only be done after the felon has been back in free society for some time.	Felons should be allowed to vote to make things fair for African-Americans. A former criminal who's paid off their societal debt should be afforded the same rights as everyone else without arbitrary exclusions.
18303085	Most definitely, I agree that felons should be allowed to vote. Their rights should not even be suspended in my opinion, not for a day. Taking away the right to vote is the ultimate affront in a so-called democracy, and it helps create the downward spiral of criminals in our system. It is just another reason that once a person becomes a felon, they have very little chance of ever succeeded in this country. They'd be much better off leaving the country, however even that right is removed. Criminals are citizens too. This antiquated idea of removing voting rights is akin to the policies you see in North Korean.	Felons should be allowed to vote. Felons should not lose their rights, for even a day. Every citizen should be allowed to vote, even felons. Felons are people just like everyone else and this practice is similar to North Korea.
18410631	We live in a society where the criminal charges that a defendant faces and the likelihood of conviction depend very strongly upon how much money the defendant can spend for legal representation. As long as that remains true (and it is true), Roger Clegg's argument remains invalid. There are very many poor people in prison for non-violent crimes that were prosecuted while the defendant was too young and too poor to pay for legal representation. Many of them would not have been convicted of felony crimes if could have afforded a competent attorney. Thus, the blanket denial of suffrage for all felons cannot be justified.	Prisons are full of people who did not get a fair trial because they lacked the money and experience. Not all felons would have been convicted of felony if they could have afforded a good attorney so their privilege to vote cannot be justified.
18324478	How about a middle ground: felons, after a certain period without any more troubles with the law, except for very minor infractions, should have their voting right automatically restored - without any special processes that can be opened to voter suppression abuse.	After a period of probation, felons should have their voting rights restored.
18324250	People convicted of crimes don't lose their interest in how their class is treated. While the Constitution barred slave, women and who knows from voting, times have changed. Without those who know the unfairness of incarceration, the voter lists would be tipped in favor of those who want to continue the incarceration industry. Once released and encouraged to renter after paying their debt, how can they be denied the right to help select someone who might change the way society treats people who have erred?	Convicts still care about the treatment of their class. If felons were allowed to vote it would help to put an end to the unfair incarceration industry. Felons should not be denied their right to vote after paying their debt to society and reentering the community.
18321217	There are a lot of politicians who make laws before they go to prison, or before they are found guilty of ethics violations. And many who write laws to give politicians relative indemnity. Any politician who claims convicted felons shouldn't vote more or less consider themselves above the law. Those who are convicted felons are not always guilty of the crimes they were convicted of, and when they are, they are a fraction of Americans who have committed crimes but not caught. Most Americans are guilty of some violation of law during there lifetime. Refusing to treat all people with dignity and make them feel forgiven and responsible citizens is a greater crime than most convicted felons are imprisoned for.	Many felons are not actually guilty and many guilty are not caught. Most American's are guilty of committing crimes. It is a crime to rob people of their dignity and forgive them once they are free from imprisonment.
18319810	I don't think anybody should be voting while incarcerated. The point of a criminal sentence is to deny criminals, for a period, the rights and freedoms of a citizen. But once someone is released from prison, surely they should have a chance to reintegrate. Haven't they paid their debt? To say to someone who stole a car at 17 that they can NEVER again be a full citizen is completely unjust.	Have they not already paid their societal debt on completing their sentence. A person who stole a car at 17 should not be barred from being a full citizen for life.
18319561	Our drug laws would probably have been liberalized far sooner if we had simply allowed all US citizens to vote including former felons and even those incarcerated. Our politicians would probably be paying attention to the issue of recidivism if the people most affected by it were people who could vote. Improving educational and employment prospects for former felons would become a priority if these people were in fact voters. Wrongful convictions, which still happen with far too much frequency in America, would get the extra special attention they deserve if we allowed felons to vote. By disenfranchising this entire group of people, we have created a system that ignores the serious issues related to this population. We have the highest incarceration rate in the world and we disenfranchise millions who are formerly incarcerated because of past mistakes. This process further exacerbates the challenges of ethnic minorities and the working poor. We need to empower all US citizens to be able to participate in our democracy so we can start to create the more equal and fair society we all claim to support.	Politicians would pay more attention if felons could vote. Education and employment would become more important for felons if they could vote. Allowing felons to vote would help wrongful convictions get proper attention from government. If felons are not allowed to vote, it causes society to ignore issues that pertain to prison populations. We put a lot of people in jail and punish them for their past mistakes once free and this is a challenge for the poor and minorities. We need to empower all US citizens to participate in our democracy, to create the more equal and fair society.
18319483	I believe that felons should have to petition a court for restoration of their complete citizenship rights. Those that can show a reformed lifestyle should have their rights restored. Some will argue that if they have paid their debt to society they should be automatically be restored, but we make sex offenders register and limit their housing choices. Child molesters are forbidden from some occupations. We do limit the rights and freedoms of some felons even after they have served their time. I do not believe anyone convicted of a violent crime should ever be able to own guns.	Felons can be restored to society, thus they should have their rights restored.
18314565	If felons complete their sentences, their punishment should be over. It's bad enough that they can't get hired. Punishment continues because they can't be full citizens even though they've paid their debts to society. No wonder there is so much recidivism.	Once a felon has paid their debt to society they should not continue to be punished by not being able to vote.
18313378	I live in Florida which makes it very difficult to restore civil rights to felons. The laws have become a new form of Jim Crow to prevent minorities from voting. Your chance of becoming a felon is much greater if you are dark of skin hue. Or a different ethnicity than being a WASP. Time to end this persecution of people We need to reform our justice system.. After release all voting rights should be restored . If a non violent conviction even the right to own fire arms should be restored.	The laws are a form of discrimination to prevent minorities from voting. We should reform our justice system so that once released from prison felons are able to vote.
18308572	I'm not sympathetic to felons but there are many with essentially minor possession convictions who are felons for no good reason. Any attempt to exclude felons has to take the deeply racist nature of drug enforcement into account. Aside form that sticking point I don't believe that felons should vote.	There a people who are felons for no good reason.
18302735	"If there were any evidence that a state's disenfranchisement law is truly discriminatory, it would be considered unconstitutional under Supreme Court rulings." That assumes an impartial Supreme Court. As we all know, the Republican appointees are on a mission to disenfranchise minorities. That is why they were placed on the Court. Clegg assumes his conclusion, and then reasons back to it.	Disenfranchisement laws are disproportionately discriminatory against African-Americans. Republicans are on a mission to disenfranchise minorities.
18301753	While not all former inmates truly "learn their lesson," I do believe more former inmates come to realize what they've done wrong and desire to live a better life post-time served. It is most unfortunate they are almost always denied of a being able to start a new life solely based on the basis of the fact that they are a "felon." As a current resident in the Commonwealth of Virginia, today I am grateful "Virginia's Governor Terry McAuliffe just restored voting rights to more than 200,000 convicted felons." (source: NYT). People change; people change daily. Before denying a convicted felon of any and all of his/her privileges (e.g. voting rights), why not consider the fact that he/she did serve time of which, was deemed sufficient for his/her crime before coming to a firm decision that convicted felons should not have the right to vote?	While not every person who has served a jail sentence has reformed I believe many realize the wrong they have done and strive to be better. People can change and grow over time, once their time is served they deserve to have their rights back.
18302711	Isn't federalism wonderful. States can be laboratories for democracy, ... except when they do something judged inappropriate. Can we expect Roger Clegg and his friends to take up the fight to deny felons the votes in Maine and Vermont, which do not disenfranchise their felons at all, or in the states that re-enfranchise their felon on release from prison. More importantly, it's time to ensure that the census counts incarcerated felons at their place of last residence rather than their prison? Counting the incarcerated at their prisons boosts the legislative representation of the prison areas at the expense of the prisoners' real neighborhoods.	Prisoners being counted at their prison instead of their home impacts legislative representation.
18301314	So this thesis is "Once a felon, always a felon?" The stated purpose of incarceration correction. In California it is the CDC or California Department of Corrections, not the prison department. A convict is released, put on parole, satisfies the requirements, and is expected to become a normal member of society. But at the same time loses certain right that other citizens have. He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. So even though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected. Worse yet, in many cases they can not get certain work, are relegated to the lower levels of society, yet expected to be productive. So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration? Some may be career criminals, but as we have seen fr to many times, most are not, but in many cases return to crime as that is what they know best. What we see here is a call for permanent retribution, no matter the crime.	Felons should have the same rights as citizens. He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. Though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected.
12997439	I believe it's true that Prozac along with talk therapy has been more effective than either alone for many depressed people. And not years of psychoanalysis either, but limited time cognitive therapy. The Prozac lessens the feeling of being out of control, subject to moods with little power over them. Then once that takes effect, the person can benefit from therapy, gaining some objectivity and distance from what had previously overwhelmed them. This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs. Budget cutting has lessened availability of mental health treatment, leading to crime, violence, family pathology and incarceration. We should study the methods used in the many countries with universal tax supported health care. What are their mental health budgets, and how do they treat with Prozac type drugs and therapy where needed? Have these countries reduced funding for mental health as part of a spending austerity campaigns?	The combination of Prozac and talk therapy have been very effective for many depressed people. Prozac helps people perform well in therapy by controlling their overwhelming moods and help them make positive improvements in their lives.
4967224	My pursuit of my 'right weight' also includes a daily cardio & weightlifting routine, cycling (18-20 miles a trip), hiking (6-10 miles) and the like when I'm not in the gym, visits with my physician, a nutritionist (confirming my already stellar diet) and an endocrinologist. And here I sit still, @ a 35 BMI. There are nights I've cried myself to sleep, exhausted and sore while my body mocks my attempts to reach my 'right' BMI. And while I will likely never, ever get there, I take comfort in my fitness. Yes, FITNESS. My blood sugars are stellar, my cholesterol good, blood pressure low and resting heart rate my doctor's envy. Are all obese people this way? Of course not. But as discussed now, I would be labeled a high medical risk for 'failing to be thin' and fair game for discrimination. Tell me how these things would apply to ME, oh sage ones who think everyone is fat because they want to be.	Despite some peoples vigorous efforts to be healthy they cannot lose weight. I am in good health as measured by certain parameters. Obese people are still people who have rights.
4963738	More legislation, more lawsuits, are not the answer. Let's be clear. Many people with real disabilities - people who have lost a limb, for example, or who are partially sighted - deserve and need legal protection against discrimination. But obesity is not in the same league. It's a lifestyle choice.	People with real disabilities - people who have lost a limb, or partially sighted - deserve and need legal protection against discrimination. Obesity is not in the same league. Obesity is a choice, not something forced on someone.
4969473	Churches SHOULD do this, employers SHOULD do that, insurance companies SHOULD do this! Everyone should do something except the person who weighs too much for his or her own good and who, as a result of excess weight, increases health care costs for society as a whole. You don't need money to walk more and eat less.	Obese individuals should care for themselves both for their own health and the economic burden on society as a whole. Good health can be obtained without money.
4969850	Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors. Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field. If you have an addiction, any addiction, you should be treated equally in the workplace.	Obesity is not a disability, just as addiction isn't. A person with an addiction, which includes addiction to food, should be treated equally in the workplace.
4969447	Could someone explain to how "see the doctor more than people of normal weight" is proven by "persons who are obese spent $1,429 (42 percent) more for medical care?" Yes, being obese increases the risk of major hospitalization, but so does many other factors. Do we increase rates on a sliding scale based on weight? Oh, that extra five pounds after the holidays is goin' cost you. Are we also advocating forced retirements to reduce medical costs? How about genetic testing prior to being hired? Could we require listing your family medical history on the job application? Could we charge you more for insurance if you purchased a motorcycle, or a sports car, or a ski boat, or an ATV? What about TV, could we monitor your viewing time, and charge you more if you don't get enough exercise? Could we require tests of your spouse or kids? Your 150 lb, 10 year old has been dropped from your plan. This type of thought is insane.	Obesity is just another health problem that leads to hospitalization. Rates should not be increased on a sliding scale based on weight, as even a small weight gain could cost you. People should undergo genetic testing as a part of the hiring process.
4966919	During my career as a college administrator I interviewed my fair share of obese job applicants for professional positions. Regardless of their intellect or job experience, there was no chance of their being hired. Why? Because they couldn't fit in the chairs at the conference table where search committees met. They sat on the edge of chairs and almost fell forward trying to balance, which didn't do much for their concentrating on complex question from faculty members. They were constantly out of breath, and sweating, and struggled to reach for the glass of water set before them. They could barely walk to various sites around campus for a required tour, and in some cases, wouldn't even try. They shuffled down the halls while their fit escorts waited, if not patiently, certainly politely. Faculty and other professional jobs require energy and stamina. No amount of intellect can overcome these kinds of self-induced problems, and discrimination is really irrelevant in such cases when one considers the terrible burden such people impose on employers.	These people have self induced problems that over rule any of their intellect. Obese people are burdens on employers because of health insurance costs.
4967322	Obesity is a complex problem that cannot simply be reduced to eating too much. Genetics, some mental illnesses and medications are often factors. There are other factors that we do not yet know about. Obesity seems to be the last great bastion of acceptable prejudice in our society. Derision and prejudice that is now unacceptable (and rightly so) for blacks, gays, the disabled and other minority groups apparently is still okay for our obese citizens. Maybe we should think about that.	Obesity is not as simple as just eating too much. Other groups have been protected, so our obese citizens should be as well.
4970171	All this hand wringing over the plight of the obese! I think the bottom line is that asking people to take responsibility for their health, in the light of so called "Societal problems/mass obesity" theory is just a joke. If you want action, do something that rewards the behavior you seek to reinforce - lower health care premiums if you drop weight. If I hear another person claim that "this is my natural weight and I'm comfortable with it" I'm going to be sick. Just wait and see if your knees are comfortable toting around an extra 50 pounds over a lifetime...	We should reward those who exhibit the behavior we choose such as lower premiums for those who lose weight. I get annoyed hearing people say that their weight is natural.
4968778	I was obese. Then, undergraduate school and white crosses changed that. I am aware that my opinion will be challenged, but we should not discriminate in any manner against obesity. Why? Because it's not the right way to treat people. All of the evidence presented in this debate is valid. Particularly that on the costs of our health and its burden on others. I do not believe that there is one obese person that would choose to remain obese if a miracle drug could return them to a normal weight. Obesity is a physical and an emotional nightmare. It eats at you (no pun intended) every hour of the day. We have irrefutable proof that it's thoroughly toxic, in every sense of the word. And yes, we should, as a people, be nutritionally sophisticated. Yet, we're not - we're nowhere near. But, by adopting many of these reforms and legislating stiff penalties, we are just going too far. Have we sunk so low that we are now to make laws and develop policies against the physique of our neighbor? The very thought is insane. There are better ways to solve this problem.	This would simply be treating people unfairly. I don't think Obese people would remain obese if there were a drug to make them a normal weight. There is proof that this idea is terrible. It is low to develop laws against the bodies of people.
4968661	Our American life style is an agenda for soda , fast food with too much sit time at work then at home have made us the Fat Nation we are today. It's a math problem - calories in and calories burned . many take Easy street which ends up being a Dead End. But , there is alot of money made off these products , soda , diet plans & services like the doctors who treat fat people . As another reader said : It all gets down to making choices , the right choices. To some , it easier to pick up fast food and harder to pass by - go home and make a healthy dinner tonight. Cooking burns calories.	America is an obese nation because our lifestyles revolve around unhealthy foods and sitting. Obese people should not be protected from discrimination by businesses because they are responsible for their condition.
4968578	Apparently self discipline is a thing of the past -- and the whole country is paying for it. These undisciplined people will eventually use up all of our Medicare and Medicaid money -- a person can only hope not to get cancer, break a leg, or have any expensive medical problems in the future -- as there won't be any money left to pay for them.	The unhealthy people in question are drains on the system.
4966940	"All the medical evidence points to the fact that it's nearly impossible to keep off weight once lost. The body just won't let you." This is incorrect, and could lead to fatalism that could harm people who are overweight. For example, I lost 70 pounds. That was at least a year ago. It has not come back. It is easy to keep off. The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day. Exercise has also been shown to help prevent the return of weight, though it isn't useful as a weight loss tool. Sadly, what is known today is far different from the older diet and exercise advice that many still follow.	Overweight people can lose weight. We know more today than older diet and exercise advice told us.
4966790	I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese "he could not earn a living (sic!)". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid.	As a doctor I have seen a death caused by obesity which is an avoidable risk. The obesity epidemic is ignored by Doctors and McDonalds.
4966713	While true that some people are genetically predisposed toward excessive weight gain with the same fatty diet, employers should not be held accountable for the poor choices these individuals make. Doing so, would be another step away from personal responsibility which is so badly lacking in America today.	Obese is a disease treat it the same in stages higher stages means i am no longer in control help. It would be another step away from personal responsibility, which is lacking in America today.
4965795	I did not have a weight problem growing up, was a cheerleader in high school, and led an active life in college. I have scoliosis, sciatica, severe osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, osteopenia, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, have also been bone on bone on both knees since 1997 and need a knee replacement. On a pain scale from 1-10, I am probably at 12 or 13 all day long. I am 5'3" and weigh 250 pounds. I can walk about 100 feet without my cane and can stand for about 5 minutes. I am now a Type 2 diabetic because of the weight and I consume no more than 900 healthy, yes healthy, calories a day to maintain this weight. The weight is due to the lack of exercise and, for obvious reasons, I cannot do that any longer. I am not a stupid person (have a high IQ), am not lazy or indolent, but, in the past, have had to work three times harder than the normal person to prove that I was worthy of being considered, at the very least - a human being. There are many more out there like me and we should not be judged by appearances.	Obese people are not stupid or lazy, they must work harder to prove their worth. We should be judged on more than our appearance.
4965656	Whatever obesity is or isn't, it is an economic factor in the globalized market place. If it adds an ultimate cost to US products and services, then it decreases the US competitive advantage and thus negatively affects the US economy. You can argue about all the other factors for as long as you want, but, you can't get around this one!	It is something that affects economics. This decreases competition which could negatively affect the economy.
4964986	We are so becoming a failing nation. Between the rights of illegals and uneducated and now obese are claimimg rights, we will never survive as a country because the ills of the country will never ever keep the country going.	Illegal residents, the uneducated, and the obese claiming rights threatens the survival of the country.
4964300	Penalizing the obese? What about the penalty employers must pay for hiring obese people? How is that fair? Why should the employer foot the bill? Who should pay the price? How about the responsible party? Why isn't it fair to ask the person responsible for the increased cost to pay it, rather than ask the employer, who has no control over the employee's lifestyle choices, to pay the increased cost?	Companies have a right to align themselves with healthier individuals if they so choose, which doesn't penalize obese people but instead might motivate them. It is unfair that employers must pay a penalty for hiring obese people. If you are obese, you should be responsible for paying the overage costs associated with insurance, not the employer who has no control over your life.
8835812	My understanding is that college athletic teams were started to teach leadership, discipline and teamwork to students. With the introduction of the athletic scholarship schools went down the slippery slope of bringing in kids who either were not prepared to do collegiate work or had no serious intent of gaining a degree. Instead of being a benefit to the academic student body, athletics became something more geared toward the fan in the stands and the alumni association- students be damned. What Spelman has done is right in so many ways. The new program will benefit all students, will open new friendships among students and will give students valuable training in how to maintain a healthy body for a lifetime. Truth be told, intramural athletics can provide the same benefits to the student body as varsity and can engage many more students at a far lower price. The fitness program is wonderful.	Sports programs teach important things like leadership, discipline, and teamwork. Sports programs in undergraduate schools should not be dropped since the new program stands to benefit all students and con provide the students opportunities for friendships and increased health.
8829712	I agree with this 100 percent. Growing up overseas, I played sports w/ a German city club. Not only is it separate from school, but it allows kids to sample a wide diversity of sports (e.g. squash, handball, track. fencing) in addition to the standard.	In Germany as a kid I played sports with a city club and had access to a larger sampling of sports.
8833590	I would agree that the Division III model makes more sense than Division I or II, but I'd still ask, why is even that much a good use of educational funding? University should be about education. The European model where sports clubs are sponsored by cities or municipalities allows people who want the chance to participate in competitive athletics, at zero cost in distraction to the mission of their universities. That's even better than Division III.	Sports programs are not a good use of education funding. Sports programs are not what universities are there for. Other institutions can provide would-be college athletes with the same athletic opportunities without imposing costs on the universities.
8828406	I have a son who has participated in DIII cross country and track and field for the past four years. It has been a wonderful experience for him; he loves the competition and the team spirit, but everyone understands that academics comes first.	School sports have a place as long as academics come first.
8829666	Why wasn't Reed College in Oregon not included in this discussion? As long as I can remember, this elite liberal arts college in Oregon has advertised its non-participation in intercollegiate athletics, offering only intramural sports. Theirs, I believe, is an ideological choice (and one with which I agree). I believe that sports has no place in schools and even less of a place in universities. Make sports part of the community, as is done in places such as Germany.	Sports should be part of the community, not part of school.
8832426	Sounds like I need to go back and polish my early 60's hack speech class "persuasive" contribution - questioning the role of football on college campuses (school wasn't in any major sports conference) with half the football team in the class. It was interesting - at same time my sister was photographed at a "Ban the Ball" demo at the UofC campus. The purpose of higher education is, in large part, teaching a young person how to approach learning and apply that learning to life as it unfolds. Sports on an intramural level or low key interscholastic plane have a place - but not the spectacle of college sports serving as the training ground for professional teams. I always cringe when Americans justify marginal enterprises, products that really shouldn't exist, extreme sports, etc. with the usual "but some people make a lot of money doing it". Is that all there is???	The purpose of higher education is teaching and applying that learning to life. Intramural and interscholastic have a place but not college sports which just train athletes for professional teams.
8834740	I'm not sure what Mr. Clotfelter means when he states: "Virtually every college with a dormitory gives its students the chance to play sports." I'm guessing he refers to inter-dorm, intramural sports that many schools have. Data collected by the U.S. Department of Education clearly don't show this level of participation in intercollegiate sports. Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. When I looked at 2003 Big Ten data, I conservatively calculated that intercollegiate sports added between 400 to 800 dollars to other students' annual costs. Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that "there is no going back." How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations? Such a change would free the university from the requirement of pouring its earnings into the athletic department's money-losing sports and allow it to reduce its tuition bills for everybody.	Only a small percentage of college students participate in sports. Data shows that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive. College sports make tuition higher. If universities drop money-losing sports they can use that money to reduce tuition.
8827392	Boy, is this asinine. The commodification of everything, the thimble-witted emphasis on turning everything, including research universities, into a "brand", is precisely the problem. The fact that high-stakes college athletics are in synergy with this larger trend is no recommendation in their favor. As to the idea that "there is no going back", well, that's pretty feeble, too. In 1988 in Moscow I'm sure that most people, including everyone in the Politburo, would have told you that the Soviet system in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe was so firmly ensconced in power that "there's no going back". And had you talked to them three years later?	College athletics being turned into "brands" is causing universities to lose context of their true purpose.
8828822	The author failed to explain why school loyalty is valuable. Nor did he address why being a cultural touchstone or a valuable brand is something to which an institution of higher education should aspire. He needs to make those arguments because big-time competitive sports cost money that could otherwise be spent on students' educations or research.	School loyalty is necessarily a good thing, nor is making a school a valuable brand or cultural commodity. If they didn't have to spend money on competitive sports it could be spent on research and education.
8837139	College sports are almost a case of the tail wagging the dog. They end up dictating student life in many cases, lead to undesirable behaviors (from riots to binge drinking), and negatively affect students' ability to focus on academics. On good years, sports do just enough to fund themselves. During bad result spells, they end up eating up significant amounts of money. It's hard to get rid of them, especially at big state schools, because many donors seem to identify more with the teams than with the university. I'd either go the Division III route, and also provide the option for the teams to go pro while paying a license fee to the college for use of their logo and name. Pay the athletes, give them contracts, and keep the finances of the teams and the schools separate.	Sports in college are extraneous and have inappropriate impact on academic issues. Sports take over student life and cause bad behavior and an inability to focus on academics. If sports preform well, they can fund themselves. Sports programs spend a lot of money, but often they attract donors.
8835695	For a small college dropping such sports programs is probably wise but for the big schools, it's not. The Penn State scandal brought out all the reasons that intermural athletics which draws popular audiences can undo an institution of higher learning. The enormous amounts of money from the media, media sponsors, alumni and fans of the sports programs led to the University finding itself incapable of dealing with a serial pedophile on it's staff. But these programs do bring lots of revenue which all of the other activities of a University simply don't. There are no taxpayers in this country willing to support the education of other peoples children, anymore. The costs of going from papers and books to electronic communications as well as the collapse of actual wealth creation in this country has raised the costs of doing everything that Universities do. The revenues from NCAA athletics are very important.	These programs bring lots of revenue, which all of the other activities of a University simply don't. No taxpayers in this country are willing to support the education of other peoples children. The move from paper to electronic communication and the lack of wealth creation has made university more expensive. Sports should stay because revenues generated by college athletics are important to universities.
8833999	"What is it about a good football team that exerts such a pull on alums? Why...would sophisticated erudite people invest so much emotion in the outcome of a game played by...20-year-olds? (Because)...we are bonded by common experience, and when the attachment originates with our school, the effect is powerful. We want to exult...in that feeling that comes with being part of a successful 'tribe'. A sports team represents everyone in the group, and serves as an agent of togetherness. Doesn't matter what your politics are, or where you're from, or what your job is--everyone can stand shoulder to shoulder and cheer for the Cardinal...We care, more than we usually want to admit, about what happens when those 20-year-olds take the football field on our behalf every Saturday. For those few hours, they are us and we are them." From "Stanford", a publication of the Stanford Alumni Association, November/December, 2011 My sentiments, precisely.	Common experience bonds humans, and the effect is powerful when the attachment originates with our school. Sports teams represent a sense of togetherness and bring people together every Saturday on a football field. The public can live vicariously through the sports teams.
8833835	Israeli universities are serious academic institutions with some sports for fitness and recreation, but little in the way of organized competition. After the army, students are ready to begin real life: get a career, get married, and go to work (often while they are at college). They seem undiminished by the lack of sports in their life and their schools set an example of what American college life could be if it were cured of sports mania. Bravo for Spellman and other schools that divest from intercollegiate sport and reinvest in the education, health, and maturation of their students. Their graduates will have an edge because of it.	In Israel, the lack of organized collegiate sports does not impact the education or lives of graduates. Schools that divest in intercollegiate sports, and invest in education, health and their students will turn out more competitive students.
8828991	As a former Big Ten athlete, I find the idea of eliminating sports and replacing them with wellness programs flat out ridiculous. Those who do not compete in sports have no true understanding of what they do for you. Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc.. You can lead a horses to water, but you can't make them drink.	Sports have a place and serve a purpose, they are necessary to learn certain skills. Highly competitive sports helps you learn to compete in the business world. Far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can understand. Sports programs teach competition and the will to succeed. From what I have seen student athletes graduate at a higher rate than everyone else. Sports teach discipline and purpose.
8831916	I taught at a couple universities. Often I'd be asked by parents of college age kids about where to send their kids. My quick response was usually, "send them North to a school that does not have a winning football team. Poor athletics departments usually means better funding for everything else."	Money from discontinued sports funds other activities.
8831573	Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished. The NCAA needs reform as a whole-- sports need to be taken off the peddle stool that they currently stand on. But the importance of sports for many shouldn't be forgotten-- it is just as important as the arts and academia. The debate shouldn't be if varsity sports should be cut-- but how to reform the NCAA so that all schools can keep varsity sports without spending so much money.	Sports programs should not be dropped in undergraduate schools because playing varsity lacrosse was great for me as it kept me focused, provided friends, challenged physically and mentally, and taught lessons of trust and teamwork. Sports helped me both personally and professionally. Arts and academia are important but sports should not be placed by the wayside.
8830542	Sports is big business...Great...Move it out of ALL SCHOOLS and into other plces. I wish our local schools would get out of sports, as we spend mch to much money on a few gifted athletes and almost nothing on our gifted students.	Sports is a business and should not be involved in educational institutions. Local schools should get out of sports. Too much money is spent on a few gifted athletes while almost nothing is spent on gifted students.
8829299	More than half a century ago, Robert Maynard Hutchins observed that intercollegiate athletics bears the same relation to education as bull fighting to agriculture. He then shut down the program. RMH, where are you, now that we really need you?	sports in college are as important education as bull fighting is to agriculture.
8829278	It is a no-brainer - of course college sports should be eliminated. They have nothing to do with education nor with college. They are simply money-machines and training facilities for professional teams. Ms. Tatum from Spelman is right on the money: college sports have nothing to do with physical fitness, except for the few so-called students who participate in those sports. The TV and sports betting world benefit far more from college sports than do the athletes.	Sports programs have nothing to do with education. Sports programs do not benefits colleges. College sports only benefit a few, who are barely students in their own right, leading to little value for other students. Gamblers and TV benefit from college sports more than the players.
8829168	intercollege sports should be eliminated so that costs for an education can drop. physical education on campus should concentrate on teaching stretching and personal physical conditioning. intramural sports are fine. the huge expense of facilities and time and money spent flying around make off campus sports in this environment out of date	Eliminating sports programs would make college more affordable. Campuses should focus more on teaching stretching and personal conditioning than sports. Off-campus sports require a huge outlay of time and money for transportation and are out of date.
8831613	Do ANY programs make money after taking into account: Amortization of physical plant including all athletic venues and buildings occupied exclusively by coaches, staff and athletes. Maintenance, heating, cooling, groundskeeping, police & fire protection for all athletic facilities and the territory that surrounds them. Administrator time spent dealing with athletic scandals, criminal athletes, and spoiled coaches. Subsidized travel to post season games by administrators and board members. Also consider: The total amount of tax deductible contributions to higher ed is likely to be a relatively fixed sum within any given set of tax laws. Therefore athletic department contributions subtract from contributions to legitimate academic purposes and should be counted as a cost, not a benefit.	Sports programs are too expensive. Tax deductible contributions to higher education is likley to be a fixed sum; athletic programs drain money from academic programs.
17412381	I have two extremely gifted children with ADHD. Their bodies are constantly in motion, and when they were younger, they could be up and wandering the classroom without even being aware of it. They would blurt out answers, talk with their peers, and fidget ceaselessly. Part of it was boredom, yes, but with medication, they were able to learn how to monitor their behavior, to slow down their bodies, and to interact appropriately with their classmates. The teacher was able to provide enrichment lessons instead of focusing on their disruptive behavior. We parents were able to teach them self-control techniques. As they aged, we were able to wean them off meds, and they function just fine in high school. Unmedicated, I doubt they would have received the appropriately differentiated education that has allowed them to succeed in school. If a child truly has ADHD, then denying them medication is the equivalent of denying a near-sighted child glasses.	Diagnoses of ADHD in children helped them recieve proper medication and monitoring to acclimatize them to classrooms. Diagnoses allowed teachers to provide enrichment lessons for the child instead of being disrupted by the child's inattention. Parents have been able to teach children self-control after being diagnosed with ADHD. If tADHD children were undiagnosed and unmedicated, I do not believe they would succeed in school. A child with ADHD needs medication to function.
17412760	As the PARENT of an ADD child, I'd say the diagnosis has definitely helped my son. The school provided him with the extra support he needed to help him learn how to manage and move forward. He's been in the program for 4 years now and ready to leave the program. He has learned and mastered the skills necessary to manage himself and his own work both in and out of school. He's not on any meds. He's never been on any meds. I refused to put him through any of that. And he's done very well. I'd say the school deserves the majority of the credit for where my son is today. We went from spending 4 hours of guided help on homework on a nightly basis to him doing his homework all on his own without any help and having it completed in 20-45 mins. And he's an honor roll student.	ADD diagnoses has helped my son. Diagnoses allowed my child to get the support he needed to be successful. Diagnosis can help treat problems. He went from having trouble to being an honor roll student.
4580936	how about the claim that korea and vietnam are also part of china because they were part of china 1000 years ago. why would the world listen to these crazy claims by chinese everytime when US sells weapon to taiwan? Can china show to the world that it has the capacity to govern a well run democratic country? can china even demonstrate that it can govern its own people and territories in a democratic and non corrupted way?	There are other areas of Asia that were also once part of China, but are not now. China needs to show the world that it has the ability to govern a well run democracy. China cannot demonstrate that it can govern itself in a non corrupt way.
4583769	I see no reason why appropriate defensive arms shouldn't be sold to Taiwan if it wants to purchase them. And I also see no reason why the latest model F-16's shouldn't be sold to them as well. After all, Taiwan is a US ally in the region so why shouldn't we be willing to support our allies?	There is no reason we shouldn't sell reasonable defensive arms to Taiwan. We should support our ally Taiwan and continue to sell them arms.
4581165	I am sure Mr. Murray knows what he talks about regarding the capabilities of various weapon systems. The danger is that weapon sales at that scale will change the calculations on each side and may trigger an immediate response from China that the US does not want to face. Also, not only did the US make promise to Taiwan, but also made promise to China.	Selling arms to Taiwan could trigger an unwanted response from China.
4581232	The US is the single most destabilizing factor in the world since the end of WWII. The US involved in one way or the other in every conflict in the 20th century. Fortunately, the end for that arrogant attitude is coming to an end. The era of US supremacy is coming to an end.	The US has been the most destabilizing factor in the world since WWII. The United States always tends to get involved in conflicts.
4580800	I agree with the comments that Taiwan is a democracy now, and that the US needs to side with democracy in Asia. China is by all accounts still very undemocratic and is fighting the tail end of a Civil War with the Chinese Nationalists with which Taiwan had very little to do, but Taiwan's future as a free and democratic nation is now being held hostage to that Civil War. The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member. In the 1950s and 1960s we made the mistake of isolating China. Now we are making the mistake of letting Taiwan dangle in diplomatic isolation. The people in Taiwan deserve better from us.	Taiwan is a democracy, and the US should side with democracy in Asian. Taiwan's future as a democracy is at risk because of a civil war being fought in China that Taiwan had little to do with. The US economy and Taiwan's defense programs both benefit from selling arms to Taiwan. The citizens of Taiwan deserve fair treatment from the US.
3175740	No to tax breaks for private education - it takes public money away from public schools, which need. Furthermore, this will further erode separation of church and state. Finally, the is a conservative scam to take public monies for private benefit.	Private education should not receive tax breaks. Public schools need the tax money. This is a scam by conservatives to take public money and benefit privately.
3188226	The reason that we should not give home-schoolers a tax break is simply that the education of our youth is the civic responsibility of the entire adult population. Period. If some people choose not to use the publicly funded system then they are free to do so but that does not exempt them from contributing to the freely available public system.	The education of our youth is a civic responsiblity of all adults. Not using the public system does not exempt home schoolers from supporting it.
3170986	"The sentiment is right: Home schooling parents shouldn't have to pay for schools they don't use then pay again for education they do." The sentiment is completely wrong. Everyone should pay for education because everyone benefits from an educated population. I have no children in school today, but when I need a nurse or doctor in 30 years where will they come from if not from children my tax dollars are educating today? The question of how best to achieve high quality schools is another debate entirely. But the need for them is irrefutable.	Everyone is responsible for paying for public education even those who do not use it.
3175896	Taxes do NOT equal tuition, a point many, many commenters and writers miss. All taxpayers pay for public education, because an educated populace is a benefit for the entire society. Homeschooling parents believe they provide their children a better service than the government can. Great, many can. Those same homeschooling parents get indirect benefits from public education: reduced crime, a better economy, and a more cohesive community. They should support the public schools, just as childless people do.	Taxes do not equal tuition. Home schoolers should be taxed like everyone else because the taxes help the community. Homeschooled families receive benefits from the public school system and should support them.
3174640	NO. Absolutely NOT. If a parent (a *qualified* parent) wishes to homeschool their children it should be at their expense, sam eas any private school. They do not have the right to financially undermine the public school system. Homeowners without children pay school taxes too, while never utilizing the system.	Homeschooled children should be treated as if they attended private school no tax incentive. They would be financially undermining public school systems. Homeowner's without children pay school taxes too.
3173882	This is ridiculous - if parents who home school their children get a tax break or tax credit, then the people without children in the school system should be afforded the same tax break....I have NO children in school, but my taxes go to support the public school system....so if home school parents get a tax break, be prepared to also offer tax credits and tax breaks to citizens who do not have children!	People with no kids in the school system should also get a tax break if home schoolers get one. The writer has no children in school but has to pay school taxes, so everyone should have to pay them.
3172268	Although I have no idea what studies show about home schooled kids, I do know that, having hired two of them, my impression is not favorable. Both were prima donnas who spent a lot of time complaining about work rules, who thought that they should be able to change work processes to suit them, and who resorted to crying and making scenes to try and get their way with co-workers. The public school system was established primarily as a benefit to society, not just the individual child. That is why we all pay taxes to the schools whether we have kids or not. If people want to take their children out, so be it -- but they still still have their obligation to support the schools.	The public school system was established primarily as a benefit to society, not just the individual child. Even if your children aren't in public school, you are still obligated to support them.
3176230	No way should they get a tax break. If they get tax breaks, then what about the people who never had children--should they as well? What about people who don't have children in school any longer? You get what you pay for America. If you don't fund access for all to education, then we would not live in a country with the possibility for social mobility.	If they get tax breaks, then what about the people who've never had children. Should they as well? What about people who don't have children in school any longer? You get what you pay for America.
3176133	I agree with McCluskey. It is unconstitutional intrusion. If Republicans back the idea, they definitely have not gotten the message. The federal government should not be financing education, either directly through grants or indirectly through tax credits. Education is a 100% responsibility and obligation of the states. I do support tax credits by the separate states, however. Home schooled children should get the same state financial backing given to public school attendees, and yes, that would be a threat to public education. So be it. They need the threat.	The federal government should not finance private education by any means. The state is responsible for education. I support state tax credits. Home schooled children should get the same state financial backing given to public school attendees, yes that would be a threat to public education. So be it. They need the threat.
3176054	So many have said it so well, I'll just reiterate the key point: Homeschooling is a choice. When one is part of a society, one must participate and contribute for the whole and good of the society. We have long understood that when our children are well educated, the society will benefit. I agree with earlier comments that this is another ultra-conservative gesture to undermine public education and create a culture that rejects facts in favor of religious values, as though one cannot exist with the other.	Homeschooling is a choice. No matter where they attend school, everyone is part of society and must contribute to it. It undermines public education and emphasizes religious values over facts even though the two can easily co-exist.
3175505	Tax breaks for home schoolers should only be considered in the same breath as tax breaks for those who send their kids to private or parochial schools. There is no difference. All of these individuals are opting out of the publicly provided education which shapes our society. The purpose of public schools is not only to educate all children, but to create an educated citizenry that will serve our country well, with the shared values of our American society. Those who opt out - whether to send their children to private school, religious school, or keep them home - are making a choice with their discretionary dollars.	All of these individuals are opting out of our publicly provided education. Home schoolers choose not to use public schools, but they do not deserve a tax break.
3175089	NO, NO NO- This is just another conservative ploy to defund pubic institutions and make them (for profit) private. Read Diane Racitch's "Death and Life of the Great American School System". A former Bush "supply sider" discounts the widespread mantra that charter schools and choice are good for education. I have worked with home schooled children (mostly for religious reasons) and have not been impressed with the so called advantages.	This is a trick to defund public schools. Home schoolers should not have a tax break, I have worked with them and there appear to be no advantages that would call for a tax break.
3174198	"Why should a family be saddled with the tax costs of paying for public school if they receive no benefit?" - From Ryan above. A well educated public is what leads our country to economic success, medical advancements, and a more evolved society. So perhaps if you home-school and wish to not pay taxes towards education, you should opt out of any benefit given to you that is created as a by-product of public education.	Quality education is good for the country. If you home school and don't want to pay taxes for education, you should not benefit from anything created as a benefit of public schools.
3173925	All of my children have been, or are being home schooled through high school. The oldest will be graduating from college this year, the recepient of a few scholarships. Home schooling is not easy, and it is not for everyone. This being said, I have to agree with those who have posted that all of us benefit from the public school system, and must fund it via our taxes. We should demand more of our schools so that our communities' children will get the education that they should to be productive members of society.	All people must be responsible for funding public schools with tax money in my opinion. Home schools do not deserve a tax break because we should demand more of schools so kids get the education they need to participate in society.
3173879	I do not necessarily believe that the present school model of public, charter, parrochial, private schools, etc. is the only way to educate our children. However the idea that because one does not use a public service one does not have to pay for it is absurd. If you follow this logic, then every taxpayer can choose how much taxes to pay based on what services he (or she) uses. Personally I don't think all these wars are benefitting me in any way, so I then will deduct the percentage of tax that funds the wars. I use only certain roads so I will deduct my portion that goes to fix the roads I never travel. This is ridiculous!	It is unreasonable to think one can avoid paying for a public service if not using it. Parents should pay taxes regardless of whether or not their children attend school.
3173738	It would appear that the Republicans are saying since the public school system has failed its students, the solution is to let these same students teach their own children, rather than send them to public school. With what training will they be able to accomplish this task? As a college professor, I am routinely appalled at the writing ability and general innumeracy of my otherwise bright students. Public education needs stronger support; a tax break for home schooling solves nothing. How can we train twenty parents to do a better job than one professional?	Home schooling erodes support for public education and the tax break only incentivizes the untrained parent to replace a professional.
3173635	Although this might work if everyone were reasonable, I can imagine people pulling their kids out of school just to get a tax break and buy a computer. The parent then monopolizes the computer all day, ignoring the kid, and the kid ends up learning next to nothing. When the kid gets tested, he's labeled learning disabled and gets remedial services from special educators paid for by everyone else's tax dollars. Lovely.	People could take advantage of a home schooling tax break and fail to properly educate the child.
3173441	And do, I a parent who does not think the public schools are right for my kids get a tax break on private schools? What is the difference? If states want to provide a curriculum and resources to families in the state to use for education in lieu of public schools (as one commenter seems to suggest Alaska does) that makes sense to me. A tax break: no!	Should those parent's who choose private school also receive a tax break?. People who home school should not receive tax breaks, but should receive curriculum suggestions and educational resources similar to public schools in the residing state.
3172475	This is just another conservative ploy to defund the public school system. The goal is to make Americans as ignorant as possible, so that they'll believe the lies that Limbaugh, Beck, and the rest of the conservative propaganda machine are pushing on us.	This is a sneaky way to siphon funds from public schools.
3172067	Our school district is terrrible, and the results even worse. Last year a child was T-Bagged and beaten because he was white by a group of black football players. No one was punished...b/c they were afraid of the moron parents. We send all 3 kids to private school at a considerable expense to ourselves yet the money we pay in taxes goes to the school we had to pull our kids from. Is that fair?	It's not fair that I have to pay private school tuition and taxes for the school that I took my kids out of.
3171944	Who has the time? When the kids are are of school age, the parents - usually both - have their noses to the grindstone. It takes a lot of determination and endurance to sit Junior down for two hours of lessons right after dinner. Further, as degrading as it may seem, schools provide an important function beyond education - as a day care service permitting both parents to be employed. As to the merits of giving tax breaks for home schooling, the public schools are not just going to disappear and their expenses have to be paid. Home schooling certainly means higher taxes.	By giving a tax break to home-schoolers we increase the tax burden on everyone else for providing for public schools.
3171093	Home schooled students should take and pass the same tests as do their public school peers. If they do as well or better the families doing the home schooling should receive the same per day payment as the public schools receive for a student. The cost to the tax payer will still be less as there are no administrative costs or accrued benefits to be paid later. Just as the competition from private carriers has improved the postal service competition for students and education dollars will force the public schools to improve too.	Home schoolers should only get a tax break if they take the same standard tests and perform as well or better than public students. The cost to the tax payer will be less, given there are no administrative costs or accrued benefits. With tax money being diverted from public schools, it would force public schools to improve.
3170953	Based on the fact that many people without children, children out of school, or renters for that matter, still end up paying property taxes to fund schools in their areas, the tax breaks seem unfair. The fact is that that EVERYONE has a vested interest in the education of the kids in their communities,therefore everyone should pay. Let anyone school their kids however they want, but don't jeopardize the education of the public as a whole, to grant favoritism to a few who school their children in one certain way.	People without children pay taxes to support public schools. Everyone in a community benefits from kids being educated. Favoritism should not be granted to a few who school their children at home, jeopardizing the education of the public.
3179367	As others have stated, I want my taxes lowered because I don't have children and don't use the public school system (among other public services) because of it. In fact I believe I should get a tax break on my income for NOT costing the government extra by having children. Why do parents who choose to have children believe they deserve to pay LESS than I do in taxes just because they choose to breed. It is not as if they didn't know that children cost money to have and raise! Yet because they get a tax break for having them and I don't I am forced to help pay for them! If you want kids and choose to have them then YOU pay for them and don't expect to get your taxes reduced because of it!	I don't get a tax break, I am required to pay to help them. Parents pay for kids and don't expect their taxes to be reduced as a result.
3175179	As parents we moved to districts that had excellent public schools. Additionally we spent hours teaching our children to broaden their intellect, encourage their curiousity, and ensure their mastery of subjects. Just as our parents had done with us. We don't expect a tax credit for taking responsibility to educate our children. If citizens want to home school their children, then it is their choice. Rewarding this decision with financial incentives is not rational when there is a public option. If parents don't like the public education they have two choices, move to a better district or work hard to improve their local schools.	Tax credits should not be given for educating one's children. Home schoolers don't deserve a tax break is ludicrous because home schooling is a personal decision that should not be rewarded. Parents should either move to a better district or help improve public schooling instead of asking for a tax credit.
3175676	Republican support Home-Schooling because: -a) Religious freaks likely to be Ultra conserrvative will increase their ranks -b) People who canno't even afford public school, will try to educate their kids themselves which will lead to a nation of analphabetes easily manipulated by Fox, cnn and the like	People who cannot afford public school might try to homeschool their kids, leading to a nation of easily manipulated, poorly educated people.
3171607	The era when there were no public schools was not a good socio-economic time in the life of our nation. Anything which weakens public schools and their funding will result in the most vulnerable youth of America being left out of the chance to get an education.	If public school funding was weakened, the most vulnerable American youth will be deprived of an education.
3174520	As soon as I get my tax break for never having had a child in any school - public, private, home or otherwise. To be clear, this proposal is nasty and mean spirited - are we so self-centered now that we do we do not want to contribute to anthing of collective benefit to society?	It is self-centered to not want to contribute to anything of collective benefit to society.
3171678	Home schooling isn't only a scam designed to de-fund public schools and punish the teachers' unions for supporting Democratic candidates and policies. It is also a scam by some extremist social conservatives to keep women out if the paid labor force. This proposed tax credit should be called what it is--an increase in government spending. Then let the Republicans try to defend it.	Home schooling is a scam meant to defund public schools, punish teachers' unions for supporting Democratic candidates and policies, and to keep women out of the paid  labor force.
13863778	I have yet to meet more than a few people that enjoy working in open space arrangements. Incubators or work-spaces have open spaces because it is significantly cheaper than having private work areas, and typically charge a lot more for use of the private spaces. This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth. In a small group of people that know each other and have built trust it is invaluable. But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive. Having worked in a few offices with open spaces, I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten. Mr. Saval is 100% correct, workers understand their needs much better than executives. It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept. There's nothing knew about the idea of having an open space work arrangement. I think they used to call it a secretarial pool back in the day.	In my experience very few people like open space offices. Employees prefer privacy to open office spaces. Those working in the offices have a greater understanding of what works for them than the executives who aren't actually working on the floor.
13848748	I'll bet any amount of money that Useem not only has his own real, closed office with full height walls and a door, but that even its square footage is negotiated in his contract. I suggest that anyone like him who thinks open offices are conducive to anything but actual headaches work in one. I'll bet again that if he ever had to work like this he would take his professorial perogative of working at home.	Anyone who thinks open office layouts are good needs to actually try working in one.
13848355	Reading the most popular comments, I have my own experience echoed. I have my own business in a cube in an incubator-type space in Manhattan to save on real estate costs. While it's big enough and the walls are 6 ft. high, it's still very hard to do any of my deep thinking/focused-task work there so I often wind up going back at night for several hours to get that type of work done. All it takes is one person with a loud voice to make it difficult to focus; with a few around me, it's impossible. I wonder daily if the money I save is worth it.	Open offices can be distracting.
13846711	There are jobs that do no require concentration, focus, thought, or problem solving. Management is such a job. Marketing and sales is another. But for most everyone else open offices are the worst idea of all times. You will see that management will come up with such stupid ideas, and the marketing people will love it. The concept of thought is foreign to them, they think that the world goes around by everyone attending meetings all day. Again, worst idea of all times.	Open offices are a bad idea. Open office layout should be reconsidered because it is innovative and often somewhat foreign to some workers.
13843343	Having worked and managed people in both environments, its clear to me that any job that requires thought and/or concentration is better done in a private space. It can even be hard to focus in cubicles, but they are certainly better than an open floor. Uncontrolled collaboration isn't always beneficial. That's what team meeting (formal or informal) are for.	Thought and concentration on a job is better accomplished in a private space. Open layouts make it hard to concentrate, it's hard in cubicles too sometimes. Uncontrolled collaboration isn't always helpful.
13842842	I have worked in a variety of office environments since 1978. There is no question that the open office concept interferes with productivity for jobs that require concentration. I found it degrading to be put in a bullpen after having a windowless private office (which was also modular). There is nothing like shutting a door to say to people, don't bother me, I'm working. Movement and ambient noise are highly distracting. If you are visible, anyone can feel free to interrupt you. Over the years, the partitions got lower, more transparent, the spaces got smaller until finally, some employees don't have assigned spaces, they sign up for a space. This on top of stagnant wages for the middle class? It's insane. The real enemy to work productivity, in my view, is social media. Cut off the access to one's social media during the workday and you'd get a lot more accomplished.	The open office concept impedes productivity in jobs that require concentration. One can find being put in a cubicle degrading after having a private office. Movement and ambient noise are distracting to workers. The open office layout should remain dormant because such a layout puts individuals in prime places to be interrupted by others. Partitioned office space is slowly giving way to open office layout.
13842381	Personally I want a private office or work space with a door I can close. That's just me. If I could do without a telephone I think that would be heaven. An employees' cafeteria or lounge would be more than adequate to satisfy my social needs. Perhaps I feel this way because I was an only child and have always been content with my own company. I don't dislike company - I merely want to decide for myself when I want company and when I don't. I find most social situations a waste of my time. Why be bored to death at a party when there is a good book to read in the comfort of one's own home?	People need their privacy, even at work. Social needs at work can be satisfied by a cafeteria or lounge.
13842094	This is hardly a 'first generation' problem. For jobs requiring quiet and deep immersion in thought, an open plan can be the kiss of death. Almost thirty years ago temporary removal of cubicle walls in my IT department created chaos. It sometimes takes quite a bit of time to mentally drill down to the core of a problem. The constant distractions, visual and aural, of a badly designed open plan can, in a moment, put you right back in square one. Repeat until end of day, every day, and see how productive you are.	Open work places are not conducive to quiet or deep thought. Badly designed open office plans can cause visual and aural distraction.
13847358	I kind of feel that Adam from HOK is part of the problem. I'm sure it's really neat for design firms to play around with their innovative theories on open plan offices and comfortable acoustics, but they won't be working there. Here's an idea on how to create an effective work environment, build more private offices/spaces.	Open air spaces are not comfortable for most workers. Private offices should be considered instead.
13846630	When hired as a Technical Writer at a famous movie studio, I notified the manager that "writers work best when the loudest voice is the one in my head." "No problem," replied the boss. I'm seated with a dozen workers in an open-space environment with low partitions, lots of sunshine, ample alcoves and informal meeting spaces for on-the-fly discussions. Why does this work? Because the studio saved _even more_ money by eliminating . . . telephones! Gotta call your kid's school? Use your own cellphone and go find an alcove. Confidential news to share with the boss? Write an email, send an instant message, schedule a private conference room, or convene in the Commissary. Sounds repellent, but in truth, it works. Use your computer for communications. There's still a finite amount of space, so we can't shoehorn many more people into this environment without tipping the comfort level, the primary concern now.	One can use their computer for communication. The open office layout does not allow for an increase in work force without increasing discomfort.
13845207	I've shared an office, had a cubicle and had a private office. Just my opinion, but nothing beat my private office. I do not like people looking over my shoulder and when I speak with my boss, I'd like to be able to speak with candor which doesn't work in an open environment. It isn't just noise. Many people like privacy.	Some people prefer privacy, especially when having a sensitive discussion with a boss. Some people prefer a more private setting.
15510210	My girls' friend was texting through a movie, texting while we were eating, texting while we are at the beach - until we took the phone away. I don't know if playing, staring at waves break, or following the action on the screen is better than texting friends. But I know this girls cannot be in two places at once. I still think it is important to be aware and engaged in the world around you. Otherwise we can just put her in a room, leave the lights on low, and check in on her in thirty years and see what happened. Maybe then we will know?	Teens are hooked on screens because I've witnessed individuals who text while eating and at the beach and at a movie with their significant other.
15508810	If home captivity is the issue, then how to explain kids being glued to their screens (and parents allowing and sometimes even encouraging it, in order to free up their own supervising responsibilities) in cars, at restaurants, walking down the street, while on holiday with their families, etc??	Teenagers are looking at their phone while in cars, restaurants, walking on the street and on vacation so their parents don't have to deal with them.
15508298	Wonderful essay, thanks. The villain isn't electronics, it's a society that has allowed unreasoning fear to turn its children into prisoners, stunting them. And all the dire warnings about the horrors of phone use (!) are just another symptom of that unreasoning fear.	Electronics are not a villain, but a society that lets unneeded fear stunt children is.
15507637	Growing up in a joint custody family my weekends and holidays were spent in a basement making machines out advanced builder Lego sets cycling down/up Chatterton Parkway in Hartsdale to replenish my bagel/Mountain Dew supply. Leaving kids to their own devices is a gamble. When you get down to it there is no correlation between screen addiction and chronological age.	Leaving kids to their own devices is a gamble. Anyone can be addicted to the internet.
