	<Overview>
		<Title>Choose the correct explanation why a claim of an argument is wrong</Title>

		<!-- Here are the guidelines. Recommend keeping these short and crisp. -->
        <Text>An argument consists of a claim and a reason. In the simplest form, an argument can be read as: "Reason, therefore Claim" (or "Claim because Reason")</Text>
        <Text>In order to infer the claim from a reason, one needs a "bridge" - reasoning and logic that explains why the given reason supports the claim.</Text>
        <Text>However, in these HITs we are interested in claims that are not logically implied by the reason. We call them incorrect claims (for instance, in an argument about taking an umbrella, the incorrect claim would be "We shouln't take the umbrella" given the reason "It's about to start raining").</Text>
        <Text>Your task in the HITs will be to write an explaination why the incorrect claim does not follow the reason.</Text>
        <Text>In his qualification test you will learn how a proper explanation should look like.</Text>
		<Text>Criteria for a proper explanation:</Text>

		<List>
			<ListItem>The explanation fills the reasoning gap between the reason and the incorrect claim.</ListItem>
			<ListItem>The explanation must relate to the content of the given reason.</ListItem>
			<ListItem>The explanation does not simply repeat or rephrases what's already said in the reason.</ListItem>
			<ListItem>The explanation is kept short and does not add necessary or distracting information.</ListItem>
			<ListItem>The explanation avoids starting with "because" or "the person says" or similar and avoids pronouns if possible.</ListItem>
