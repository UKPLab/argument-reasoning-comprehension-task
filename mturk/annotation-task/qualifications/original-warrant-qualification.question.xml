        <Title>Correct an explanation to fix the logic of an argument</Title>

        <!-- Here are the guidelines. Recommend keeping these short and crisp. -->
        <Text>John Doe, a fictional person from a far away, wrote several arguments to controversial issues. His reasoning is broken as he explained reasons in his arguments so it looks like it actually implies the opposite of his standpoint.</Text>

        <Text>Your task in this HIT batch will be to correct the explanation in order to fix the logical reasoning of the argument. This qualification will show you how to correctly fix the explanation.</Text>

        <Text>Criteria for correcting the explanation properly:</Text>
        <List>
            <ListItem>Do only minimal changes in wording, casing, and punctuation, try to keep the original line of reasoning. It might only involve negation, indefinite pronouns, or similar.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>The corrected explanation must make sense in the context of the argument.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Stay objective even if you strongly disagree with his views.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>If you feel your edits would completely change the the line of reasoning, mark it as impossible and provide an explanation.</ListItem>
