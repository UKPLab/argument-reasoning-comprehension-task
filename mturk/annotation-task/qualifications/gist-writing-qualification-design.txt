Reason in argument about college sport programs:

Original text (taken out of context): "The amounts RU has paid coaches and athletic directors is, frankly, obscene. That monstrosity of a stadium, built at a cost of $100 million, is obscene."

OK RU coaches are overpaid and the cost to build the stadium is $100 million.
NO Sports programs cost an obscene amount of money to operate.


   gist: Too much university money goes into the sports program. *** RU coaches are overpaid and the cost to build the stadium is $100 million. *** Sports programs cost an obscene amount of money to operate.

About sport programs:

"Just giving up football - I'd add basketball, too - is a huge benefit."

NO Dropping sports programs is a huge benefit.
OK A huge benefit is to discontinue the football and basketball


Properties:
   gist: There would be huge benefits from the decision to drop intercollegiate sports programs like football and basketball. *** A huge benefit to the college would be to discontinue the football and basketball programs. *** Dropping sports programs is a huge benefit.


About longer school days:

Premise [428, 587] "Be it in school or at work... people need to be well rested with at least 8 hours of sleep to perform optimally.


NO The school day should not be longer, it is important for students to be well rested to start their day of knowledge.
OK To ensure the best performance in school, students should receive 8 hours of sleep.



Properties:
   gist: The school day should not be longer, it is important for students to be well rested to start their day of knowledge. *** To ensure the best performance in school, students should receive 8 hours of sleep and start at 9:00. *** School day should not be longer as it would interfere with getting the proper amount of sleep to perform optimally.



Premise [309, 427] "I know--with moral certainty--that so many people are underperformers (including me) when they don't get enough sleep."
Properties:
   gist: A longer school day would cut into the time students have available for sleep, and the lack of sleep would cause them to underperform. *** Many people, (including me)  underperform without an adequate amount of sleep. *** Students need more sleep to perform better; therefore, a longer school day would inhibit that from happening.


NO A longer school day would cut into the time students have available for sleep, and the lack of sleep would cause them to underperform.
OK Many people, including me, underperform without an adequate amount of sleep.


 *** Students need more sleep to perform better; therefore, a longer school day would inhibit that from happening.




Premise [231, 465] "We don't know for sure whether chemical weapons have been used and if they were we don't know who used them.
Not to mention the apparently minor point that attacking a country except in self-defense is illegal under international law."
Properties:


NO The U.S. does not know for certain whether chemical weapons were used, and, if chemical weapons were used, the U.S. does not know whether the Assad regime was responsible or if another party used them. Additionally, it is illegal under international law to attack another country for reasons other than self defense.
OK International law dictates that attacking a country except for self defense is illegal. Furthermore, there is no evidence that chemical weapons were used.


We are unsure if and whom used chemical weapons and it is illegal to attack a country unless it is self-defense under international law.

Premise [28, 114] "I would have been happier if my parents had left me at home for many of our vacations."
Properties:

   gist: Parents should consider vacationing without children, many children would be happier if they had a choice. *** I would have preferred to stay at home rather than go on a family vacation with my parents. *** Some children would prefer not to travel with their parents.



Premise [732, 944] "From a strict economic viewpoint, all income should be taxed equally. This would avoid the huge incentives - and wasted, non-productive investments - in gaming the system, that firms and investors routinely make."

Properties:
   gist: Equality in taxed income would eliminate risky investment by firms and investors. *** From economic viewpoint, income should be taxed the same. It is fair *** Capital gains represents a form of income and should be taxed.


OK Equality in taxed income would eliminate risky investment by firms and investors.
NO Capital gains represents a form of income and should be taxed.



Premise [258, 340] "Showing up for practice and the games is only a small part of being a team player."
Properties:
   gist: Home-schoolers should not play for high school teams, since showing up for practice and games is only a small part of being a team player. *** To be a team player requires more than participating in practice and games. *** There is more to being a team member than just practice and games - classroom and other activities are important as well.

OK To be a team player requires more than participating in practice and games.
NO There is more to being a team member than just practice and games - classroom and other activities are important as well.





Premise [0, 201] "I have two friends who are African American. She is a physician, he is an engineer. Should their daughter get any advantage over a white kid who grew up in a trailer full of meth addicts in the Ozarks?"
Properties:
   gist: It would be unfair for an African American child raised in economically stable conditions to receive an advantage over a white child born into poverty. *** Should an African American daughter of a physician and engineer receive preference over a disadvantaged white kid of meth addicts in the Ozarks? *** Income should be taken into consideration for affirmative action not just race because there are wealthy minority individuals.

NO Income should be taken into consideration for affirmative action not just race because there are wealthy minority individuals.

OK West African kingdoms that sold slaves to Europe have not paid reparations.



Properties:
   gist: They should seek reparations from the West African kingdoms instead of the European slavers. *** It is too difficult to trace lineage to truly pay reparations in a meaningful way. *** West African kingdoms that sold slaves to Europe have not paid reparations.


Add two or three questions yes/no -- is it a reason for the given argument (pick some none-reasons)
