        <Title>Choose the proper fabricated explanation of weird reasoning in arguments</Title>

        <!-- Here are the guidelines. Recommend keeping these short and crisp. -->
        <Text>John Doe, a fictive person from a far away, wrote several arguments to controversial issues. His reasoning is really weird, so it looks like he actually gives reasons against his standpoint.</Text>

        <Text>Your task in this HIT batch will be to fill the gap and write down John's reasoning so his argument makes sense. This qualification will show you how a proper explanation must look like.</Text>

        <Text>Of course, since John's reasoning is based on different commonsense knowledge, most of the explanation are fabricated. But the goal is to keep them as believable and relevant as possible.</Text>

        <Text>Criteria for a proper explanation:</Text>

        <List>
            <ListItem>The explanation must relate to the content of the given reason and claim and actually explain the reasoning.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>The explanation does not simply repeat or rephrases what's already said in the reason.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>The explanation is kept short without necessary or distracting information.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>The explanation avoids starting with "because", "the person says", "John says" or similar and avoids pronouns if possible.</ListItem>
        </List>
